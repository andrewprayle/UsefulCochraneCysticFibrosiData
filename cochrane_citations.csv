CD001402.PUB2,"Southern, KW; MÃ©relle, MME; Dankertâ€Roelse, JE; Nagelkerke, A",Newborn screening for cystic fibrosis,2009,"Abstract - Background Does newborn screening for cystic fibrosis (CF) improve clinical outcomes, quality of life and survival? Objectives To examine whether newborn screening for CF prevents or reduces irreversible organ damage and improves clinical outcomes, quality of life and survival in people with CF without unacceptable adverse effects. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. The Group's Trials Register last searched: June 2008. Selection criteria Randomised or quasiâ€randomised controlled trials, published and unpublished, comparing screening to clinical diagnosis in people with CF. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality and independently extracted data. Allocation concealment was unclear in both studies and sequence generation adequate in one. Main results Searches identified six trials. Two trials involving 1,124,483 neonates (210 with CF) with a maximum follow up of 17 years were eligible for inclusion. Varying study designs, outcomes reported and summary measures precluded calculation of pooled estimates and only data from one study were analysed. Severe malnutrition was less common among screened participants. Compared with screened participants, the odds ratio of weight below the tenth percentile was 4.12 (95% CI 1.64 to 10.38) and for height was 4.62 (95% CI 1.69 to 12.61) in the control group. At age seven, 88% of screened participants and 75% of controls had lung function parameters within normal limits of at least 89% predicted. At diagnosis chest radiograph scores were significantly better among screened participants; 33% of screened versus 50% of control participants had Wisconsin chest Xâ€ray (WCXR) scores over five (P = 0.097) and 24% of screened versus 45% of control participants had Brasfield chest Xâ€ray (BCXR) scores under 21 (P = 0.042)). Over time, chest radiograph scores were worse in the screened group (WCXR P = 0.017 and BCXR P = 0.041). Results were no longer significant after adjustment for genotype, pancreatic status, and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa â€culture results. In screened participants colonisation with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  occurred earlier. Estimates suggest diagnosis through screening is less expensive. Authors' conclusions Two randomised controlled trials assessing neonatal screening in CF were identified; data from one study were included. Nutritional benefits are apparent. Screening provides potential for better pulmonary outcomes, but confounding factors influenced longâ€term pulmonary prognosis of people with CF. Screening seems less expensive than traditional diagnosis. Plain language summary Screening newborn babies for cystic fibrosis In people with cystic fibrosis lung disease and malnutrition occur very early in life. These complications are suited to early treatment. Newborn screening may therefore improve outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis. We aimed to find out whether newborn screening prevents or reduces organ damage and improves clinical outcomes in people with CF without unacceptable adverse effects. This review includes two trials with 1,124,483 babies (210 with cystic fibrosis). The trials compared newborn screening to clinical diagnosis. We were only able to analyse data from one of the trials. This trial showed that severe malnutrition was less common among screened babies. Screened babies had better chest radiograph scores at diagnosis, but these scores became worse over time. The screened babies become colonised with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  earlier. Costs for screening were less than costs for traditional diagnosis.",1,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Neonatal Screening; Cystic Fibrosis [*diagnosis]; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Survival Analysis",10.1002/14651858.CD001402.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001402.pub2,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,88.0
CD008243.PUB2,"Prayle, AP; Hurley, MN; Smyth, AR",Percutaneous lines for delivering intravenous antibiotics in people with cystic fibrosis,2010,"Abstract - Background Percutaneous long lines (long intravenous lines) and short intravenous lines (also termed cannulae) are both used to deliver intravenous antibiotics in cystic fibrosis to treat respiratory exacerbations of the disease. The perceived advantage of a long intravenous line is a greater duration of line function, which has to be balanced against a technically more challenging insertion procedure, and the possibility of more discomfort on insertion. Objectives To compare long intravenous lines with short intravenous lines in people with cystic fibrosis receiving intravenous antibiotics, in terms of lifespan of the line, ease of insertion, complication rates of the line and patient satisfaction. This will help patients and clinicians choose between devices. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of most recent search: 26 August 2010. Selection criteria Randomised studies comparing long intravenous lines lines with short intravenous lines or comparing different types of long intravenous lines. Data collection and analysis We identified two studies, one comparing long intravenous lines with short intravenous lines, and one comparing two different types of long intravenous lines. Main results Two studies (67 participants) were included in the review. Based on the published reports, both studies had potential for bias in several domains. There is some evidence that long intravenous lines are superior to short intravenous lines. One study of 20 participants found that the lifespan of a long intravenous line is longer than that of a short intravenous line, and that participants preferred the long intravenous lines to short intravenous lines. A further study of 47 participants found no difference in lifespan, or participant preference when comparing two different long intravenous lines (the Hydrocath and Vygon EC). Neither study was powered to detect differences in serious complications of the devices. Authors' conclusions There is some evidence to support the use of long intravenous lines rather than short intravenous lines, in terms of lifespan of the line and patient satisfaction. There is no evidence to suggest that any one type of long intravenous line is superior, and currently choice of line should be determined by operator and patient preference. There are numerous devices available which are used in cystic fibrosis. Further research is required to identify clinically important differences between these devices. Plain language summary Intravenous antibiotics can be delivered through a variety of devices In cystic fibrosis, patients require prolonged courses of intravenous antibiotics. There are several devices which can be used to administer intravenous antibiotics, including peripheral cannulae (which we have termed short intravenous lines) and percutaneous (through the skin) long intravenous lines. A percutaneous long intravenous line is a flexible narrow tube which is inserted with a needle through the skin into a vein and threaded further up the vein than a short intravenous line. We have found two trials comparing these devices and including 67 participants in total. The studies compared different devices, so we could not pool the information from the two studies. However, one study showed that long intravenous lines last for longer than short intravenous lines (thus reducing the number of procedures which a participant has to undergo for a course of antibiotics). Patient satisfaction was higher with long intravenous lines compared to short intravenous lines. The study comparing two different types of long intravenous line did not show that one type was clearly better than another. Neither study was large enough to show differences in complications for the different devices. Neither study reported on important outcomes, such as the number of attempts required to insert the device. We recommend further research to compare different types of percutaneous long intravenous line.",11,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Catheters, Indwelling; Antiâ€Bacterial Agents [*administration & dosage]; Bacterial Infections [*drug therapy, etiology]; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Humans; Infusions, Intravenous [instrumentation, psychology]; Lung Diseases [*drug therapy, etiology]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",10.1002/14651858.CD008243.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008243.pub2,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,6.0
CD004111.PUB2,"Aâ€Rahman, AKM; Spencer, D",Totally implantable vascular access devices for cystic fibrosis,2012,"Abstract - Background Totally implantable vascular access devices are widely used in people with cystic fibrosis to provide intermittent venous access for therapeutic infusions. Their use is associated with some complications such as thrombosis, embolism and infection. Objectives To assess if totally implantable venous access devices provide a safe and effective route for venous access for intermittent administration of intravenous antibiotics in people with cystic fibrosis. Also to assess strategies to reduce possible complications of totally implantable venous access devices (e.g. anticoagulants to reduce the risk of thrombosis). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 05 April 2012. Selection criteria Randomised and quasiâ€randomised controlled trials which compared the use of totally implantable venous access devices in people with cystic fibrosis to other means of vascular access, trials which compared the different types of these devices against each other and trials which assessed strategies to reduce complications of these devices. Data collection and analysis No relevant trials were identified. Main results No trials were included in this review. Authors' conclusions Totally implantable vascular access devices are widely used in people with cystic fibrosis to provide intermittent venous access for therapeutic infusions. Reports of their use in people with cystic fibrosis suggest that they are safe and effective. These reports also suggest that certain interventions might reduce the risk of complications; however, it is disappointing that these reports have not been assessed by randomised controlled trials. This systematic review identifies the need for a multicentre randomised controlled trial assessing both efficacy and possible adverse effects of totally implantable venous access devices in cystic fibrosis. Plain language summary A tube fitted inside a vein to allow drug injections for people with cystic fibrosis Cystic fibrosis blocks the lungs with mucus and causes frequent infections and lung damage. Infections are often treated by giving drugs intravenously (through a vein), but regular injections can damage veins. Another option is to use a totally implantable vascular access device (TIVAD). There are different types of device and people with cystic fibrosis or their families can be shown how to administer drugs through them. TIVADs have no external portion attached when not in use and longâ€term maintenance is quite easy. Some people feel that the devices improve their selfâ€image while others do not like the way they look. Sometimes TIVADs cause blood clots and infections. We looked for randomised and quasiâ€randomised controlled trials of these devices in people with cystic fibrosis. The review found no trials to include. Reports of the use of TIVADs in people with cystic fibrosis suggest that they are safe and effective. They also suggest that certain interventions might reduce the risk of complications; however, these issues have not been examined by randomised controlled trials. We think a multicentre randomised controlled trial is needed to assess the efficacy and possible adverse effects of TIVADs in cystic fibrosis.",5,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Catheters, Indwelling [*adverse effects]; Cystic Fibrosis [*therapy]; Humans",10.1002/14651858.CD004111.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004111.pub2,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,3.0
CD002767.PUB2,"Breen, L; Aswani, N",Elective versus symptomatic intravenous antibiotic therapy for cystic fibrosis,2012,"Abstract - Background  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  is the commonest microâ€organism associated with respiratory infections in cystic fibrosis. Retrospective studies have suggested that using an aggressive policy of intravenous antiâ€pseudomonal antibiotics at regular intervals, irrespective of symptoms, increases survival. Objectives To determine whether there is evidence that an elective (regular) versus symptomatic intravenous antibiotic regimen is associated with an improvement in clinical status and survival rates in people with cystic fibrosis. To identify any adverse effects associated with the use of elective intravenous antibiotics, including an increase in the development of resistant organisms. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 15 March 2012. Selection criteria All randomised or quasiâ€randomised controlled trials describing the use of elective compared with symptomatic intravenous antibiotic policies for any duration or dose regimen. Elective versus symptomatic intravenous antibiotic regimens against any organisms were considered. People with cystic fibrosis of any age or disease severity were included. Data collection and analysis Both authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality; both extracted the data. Main results Searches identified four studies. Two studies reporting results from a total of 79 participants were included in the review. Differences in study design and objectives meant that data could not be pooled for metaâ€analysis. Neither study demonstrated significant differences in outcome measures between intervention and comparison groups. Authors' conclusions Studies are insufficient to identify conclusive evidence favouring a policy of elective intravenous antibiotic administration, despite its widespread use, neither are the potential risks adequately evaluated. The results should be viewed with caution, as participant numbers are small. Clearly there is a need for a wellâ€designed, adequatelyâ€powered, multicentred randomised controlled trial to evaluate these issues. This review will no longer be regularly updated. Searches will still be undertaken on a twoâ€yearly basis by the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis & Genetic Disorders Group. If, in future, relevant trials are identified, the review will be updated again. Plain language summary Elective (regular) versus symptomatic intravenous antibiotic therapy for cystic fibrosis Chronic infection of the airways by  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in people with cystic fibrosis is associated with deterioration in respiratory function. Intravenous antibiotics are the standard therapy for pulmonary exacerbations caused by this microâ€organism. Many centres advocate the use of elective (regular) threeâ€monthly antibiotics to reduce the frequency of exacerbations and therefore slow the deterioration of lung function. Alternatively, intravenous antibiotics are only prescribed when symptoms indicate. Elective therapy may encourage multiâ€resistance to antibiotics. This review aimed to identify randomised and quasiâ€randomised controlled trials that evaluated the results of the two different approaches. No clear conclusions were identified.

CD007336.PUB3,"Thornton, J; Rangaraj, S",Disease modifying antiâ€rheumatic drugs in people with cystic fibrosisâ€related arthritis,2012,"Abstract - Background Arthritis remains a relatively infrequent complication of cystic fibrosis, but is a cause of significant morbidity when it does occur. Two distinct types of arthritis are described in cystic fibrosis: cystic fibrosisâ€related arthropathy and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. Management of arthritis in people with cystic fibrosis is uncertain and complex because of the underlying disease and its treatment. Objectives To review the effectiveness and safety of diseaseâ€modifying antiâ€rheumatic drugs for the management of arthritis related to cystic fibrosis in adults and children. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database handsearches of relevant journal and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of most recent search: 10 July 2012. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials which compared the efficacy and safety of diseaseâ€modifying antiâ€rheumatic drugs (e.g. methotrexate, gold, sulfasalazine, penicillamine, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine and newer agents such as biologic disease modifying agents and monoclonal antibodies) with each other, with no treatment or with placebo for cystic fibrosisâ€related arthropathy or hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. Data collection and analysis No relevant studies were identified. Main results No studies were included in this review. Authors' conclusions Although it is generally recognised that cystic fibrosisâ€related arthritis can be episodic and resolve spontaneously, treatment with analgesics and antiâ€inflammatory agents may be needed. But when episodic symptoms progress to persistent disease, diseaseâ€modifying antiâ€rheumatic drugs may be needed to limit the course of the disease. It is disappointing that no randomised controlled trials to rigorously evaluate these drugs could be found. This systematic review has identified the need for a wellâ€designed adequately powered randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of diseaseâ€modifying antiâ€rheumatic drugs for the management of cystic fibrosisâ€related arthropathy and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy in adults and children with cystic fibrosis. However, given the infrequency of cystic fibrosisâ€related arthritis and the range of symptoms and severity, randomised controlled trials may not be feasible and wellâ€designed nonâ€randomised observational studies may be more appropriate. Studies should also better define the two conditions. Plain language summary The use of drugs to slow or stop progression of arthritis related to cystic fibrosis Arthritis is not a common complication of cystic fibrosis, but it can cause major problems when it does occur. There are two distinct types of arthritis in cystic fibrosis: cystic fibrosisâ€related arthropathy and hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy. The best treatment for these types of arthritis is not clear because of cystic fibrosis and its intense treatment. Some drugs can treat the symptoms of arthritis by reducing inflammation of the joints and relieving pain, but only disease modifying antiâ€rheumatic drugs can stop or slow progression of the disease. We planned to report evidence from clinical trials which compared different diseaseâ€modifying drugs compared with placebo (or dummy treatment), with each other or with no treatment. However, we were disappointed that we could not find any completed randomised controlled trials of these treatments or any evidence from nonâ€randomised controlled trials. We suggest that there should be a randomised controlled trial to look at the effects and the safety of using disease modifying antiâ€rheumatic drugs to slow or stop the progression of arthritis in people with cystic fibrosis.",9,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Antirheumatic Agents [*therapeutic use]; Arthritis [*drug therapy, etiology]; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Humans",10.1002/14651858.CD007336.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007336.pub3,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,7.0
CD007481.PUB3,"Amin, R; Noone, PG; Ratjen, F",Chemical pleurodesis versus surgical intervention for persistent and recurrent pneumothoraces in cystic fibrosis,2012,"Abstract - Background Pneumothorax is a potentially lifeâ€threatening complication for people with cystic fibrosis. Spontaneous pneumothorax is the presence of air in the pleural space and can be subdivided into first episode and recurrent. The recurrence of pneumothorax is when it occurs on the same side seven days or more after initial resolution. A pneumothorax is persistent if the air leak lasts for more than five days ( Schidlow 1993 ). Managing spontaneous pneumothoraces is controversial and there is no standard treatment. Medical and surgical intervention are the two main categories for the treatment of recurrent pneumothoraces in people with cystic fibrosis. While surgical interventions are felt to be more effective in people without cystic fibrosis, the complications directly related to the procedure, as well as the postâ€operative complications make surgical interventions riskier for people with cystic fibrosis. Additionally, these interventions have the potential to make people with cystic fibrosis ineligible for lung transplantation in the future. Therefore, the benefits and side effects or disadvantages for the medical and surgical treatment of recurrent pneumothoraces in people with cystic fibrosis need to be systematically reviewed. Objectives To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of different treatment interventions for managing spontaneous persistent and recurrent pneumothoraces in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 29 October 2012. Selection criteria Randomised and quasiâ€randomised controlled trials which compared the use of chemical pleurodesis to surgical interventions for the treatment of persistent and recurrent pneumothoraces in CF. Data collection and analysis No relevant trials were identified. Main results No trials were included in this review Authors' conclusions Pneumothorax is a potentially lifeâ€threatening complication for people with cystic fibrosis and the management of spontaneous pneumothoraces remains a topic of considerable controversy. Medical and surgical intervention are the two main categories for the treatment of recurrent pneumothoraces in this population. However, it is disappointing that neither intervention has been assessed by randomised controlled trials. This systematic review identifies the need for a multicentre randomised controlled trial assessing both efficacy and possible adverse effects of the use of chemical pleurodesis versus surgical interventions for the treatment of persistent and recurrent pneumothoraces in people with cystic fibrosis. Due to a current lack of research in this area, while searches will still be undertaken every two years, the review will only be updated if any new evidence comes to light. Plain language summary Chemicals for sticking the outer lung surface to surrounding membranes compared to surgery to stop air persistently collecting in the chest Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease which irreversibly damages the lungs. People with cystic fibrosis are prone to getting a pneumothorax. A pneumothorax is defined as the presence of air in the space between the two linings of the lungs. It can potentially kill people with cystic fibrosis because of the added stress on the heart and lungs. It can be treated by surgical and nonâ€surgical interventions. However, although these treatments are generally effective, they are far from perfect. Certain treatments work in some people but not others. Also, the treatments do have side effects and can be dangerous for people with cystic fibrosis. Currently, physicians do not know the safest and most effective way of treating pneumothorax in people with cystic fibrosis. We did not find any randomised controlled trials that compared the surgical and nonâ€surgical treatments for pneumothorax in people with cystic fibrosis. Therefore, more research is needed in this field. Future studies should compare the safety and efficacy of surgical and nonâ€surgical interventions for pneumothorax in people with cystic fibrosis. There is currently no research being undertaken in this area. We will continue to search for evidence, but will not be updating the review until we find new evidence.",12,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Humans; Pleurodesis [*methods]; Pneumothorax [etiology, surgery, *therapy]; Recurrence",10.1002/14651858.CD007481.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007481.pub3,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,22.0
CD007168.PUB3,"Tam, J; Nash, EF; Ratjen, F; Tullis, E; Stephenson, A",Nebulized and oral thiol derivatives for pulmonary disease in cystic fibrosis,2013,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis is an inherited condition resulting in thickened, sticky respiratory secretions. Respiratory failure, due to recurrent pulmonary infection and inflammation, is the most common cause of mortality. Mucoâ€active therapies (e.g. dornase alfa and nebulized hypertonic saline) may decrease sputum viscosity, increase airway clearance of sputum, reduce infection and inflammation and improve lung function. Thiol derivatives, either oral or nebulized, have shown benefit in other respiratory diseases. Their mode of action is likely to differ according to the route of administration. There are several thiol derivatives, and it is unclear which of these may be beneficial in cystic fibrosis. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of nebulized and oral thiol derivatives in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, hand searches of relevant journals, abstract books and conference proceedings. Most recent search: 13 June 2013. We also conducted a PubMed search on 26 February 2013 for relevant published articles. Selection criteria Randomized and quasiâ€randomized controlled trials comparing nebulized or oral thiol derivatives to placebo or another thiol derivative in people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis The authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, analysed risk of bias and extracted data. Main results Searches identified 23 trials; nine trials (255 participants) are included, of these seven trials are more than 10 years old. Three trials of nebulized thiol derivatives were identified (one compared 20% Nâ€acetylcysteine to 2% Nâ€acetylcysteine; another compared sodiumâ€2â€mercaptoethane sulphonate to 7% hypertonic saline; and another compared glutathione to 4% hypertonic saline). Although generally wellâ€tolerated with no significant adverse effects, there was no evidence of significant clinical benefit in our primary outcomes in participants receiving these treatments. Six trials of oral thiol derivatives were identified. Three trials compared Nâ€acetylcysteine to placebo; one compared Nâ€acetylcysteine, ambroxol and placebo; one compared carbocysteine to ambroxol; and one compared low and highâ€dose Nâ€acetylcysteine. Oral thiol derivatives were generally wellâ€tolerated with no significant adverse effects, however there was no evidence of significant clinical benefit in our primary outcomes in participants receiving these treatments. Authors' conclusions We found no evidence to recommend the use of either nebulized or oral thiol derivatives in people with cystic fibrosis. There are very few good quality trials investigating the effect of these medications in cystic fibrosis, and further research is required to investigate the potential role of these medications in improving the outcomes of people with cystic fibrosis. Plain language summary Compounds which can break down the structure of mucus for lung disease in cystic fibrosis Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder which mainly affects the lungs. Chest infections recur in people with cystic fibrosis due to a build up of thick sputum (phlegm) in the air passages. Several treatments, including thiol derivatives, aim to loosen this sputum and so improve lung function and reduce the frequency of chest infections. Thiol derivatives may be either nebulized (breathed in) or oral (by mouth). They have been shown to help in other lung conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This review aims to find out if there is enough evidence to recommend the use of nebulized or oral thiol derivatives for people with cystic fibrosis. We included nine trials; three assessed the effect of nebulized thiol derivatives. Of the nebulized trials, one compared 20% Nâ€acetylcysteine to 2% Nâ€acetylcysteine; another compared sodiumâ€2â€mercaptoethane sulphonate to 7% hypertonic saline; and the other compared glutathione to 4% hypertonic saline. Nebulized thiol derivatives were generally wellâ€tolerated with no major adverse effects. However they showed no significant improvements in any of our outcome measures. Six included trials assessed the effects of oral thiol derivatives.Three of these trials compared oral Nâ€acetylcysteine to placebo; one compared oral Nâ€acetylcysteine, oral ambroxol and placebo; and one compared oral carbocysteine and oral ambroxol (no placebo). None of the trials showed an overall significant benefit in any of the outcome measures of this review. Oral thiol derivatives were generally wellâ€tolerated with no major adverse effects. In summary, the trials included in the review did not provide any evidence that nebulized or oral thiol derivatives were either beneficial or harmful to people with cystic fibrosis. Further research investigating the effects of thiol derivatives in people with cystic fibrosis is required before their use can be recommended.",7,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Acetylcysteine [*administration & dosage]; Administration, Inhalation; Administration, Oral; Ambroxol [*administration & dosage]; Carbocysteine [*administration & dosage]; Cystic Fibrosis [complications, *drug therapy]; Expectorants [*administration & dosage]; Glutathione [administration & dosage]; Humans; Lung Diseases [drug therapy]; Mucociliary Clearance [drug effects]; Nebulizers and Vaporizers; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Saline Solution, Hypertonic [administration & dosage]",10.1002/14651858.CD007168.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007168.pub3,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,115.0
CD009448.PUB2,"Cox, NS; Alison, JA; Holland, AE; Schembri, R",Interventions for promoting physical activity in people with cystic fibrosis,2013,"Abstract - Background In individuals with cystic fibrosis there are no established targets for participation in physical activity, nor have any ideal strategies to promote participation in physical activity been identified Objectives To evaluate the effect of treatment to increase participation in physical activity in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register using the terms 'physiotherapy and exercise'. Date of the most recent search: 05 December 2013. Additionally, we conducted searches of the electronic databases MEDLINE, CINAHL (Ebscohost), PsycINFO (OvidSP) and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro). We also searched for potentially relevant, completed but unpublished studies, on several clinical trials registers. Date of the most recent searches: 10 September 2012. Selection criteria All randomised and quasiâ€randomised controlled studies which investigated strategies designed to promote increased participation in daily physical activity for individuals with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus, or in arbitration with a third author. Main results Four studies (199 participants) met the inclusion criteria and were predominantly conducted in children with cystic fibrosis. Only one study had a combined cohort of adult and paediatric participants. The description of study methods was inadequate to assess the risk of bias, particularly with regard to blinding of assessors and selective reporting. One study was conducted in an inpatient setting with follow up in the outpatient setting; while the remaining three studies were conducted in individuals with stable respiratory disease in the outpatient setting. All included studies used exercise training to promote participation in physical activity, with the duration of the intervention period ranging from 18 days to three years. No improvement in physical activity participation was reported with any intervention period less than or equal to six months. Improvements in physical activity participation were only seen where follow up occurred beyond 12 months. There was no significant impact on quality of life from any of the intervention strategies. Authors' conclusions Although participation in physical activity is generally regarded as beneficial for people with cystic fibrosis, there is a lack of evidence regarding strategies to promote the uptake and the continued participation in physical activity for this population. This review provides very limited evidence that activity counselling and exercise advice, undertaken over at least six months, to engage in a home exercise programme may result in improved physical activity participation in people with cystic fibrosis. Further research is needed to determine the effect of strategies such as health coaching or telemedicine applications, in promoting the uptake and adherence to regular participation in physical activity. In addition, establishing the ideal duration of any interventions that promote physical activity, including exercise training programmes, will be important in addressing issues relating to participation in physical activity for people with cystic fibrosis. Plain language summary Strategies to promote participation in physical activity for people with cystic fibrosis Physical activity refers to any movement of the body generated by the muscles and which burns energy. Physical activity includes exercise, but also includes activity as a part of work, chores or transport. Participation in regular physical activity is important for health and wellâ€being. For most people with cystic fibrosis, physical activity and exercise are routinely recommended, but participation in prescribed programmes is often poor. The best way to encourage people with cystic fibrosis to do more physical activity during their day is unclear. This review aimed to evaluate the strategies that encourage people with cystic fibrosis to participate in daily physical activity. There were four included studies with a total of 199 participants which investigated the effect of exercise training on participation in physical activity. These were mostly conducted in children. The study methods and results were not clearly reported, so it was difficult to tell if the results were influenced by the way in which participants were assessed, or the nature of the outcomes reported. The training programmes ranged from 18 days to three years. In two studies the exercise training programmes were supervised and in two studies they were unsupervised and homeâ€based. Due to differences in the study design and the outcomes measured, we could not combine data from different studies. None of the studies reported any improvement in participation in physical activity when the exercise training lasted less than six months. There was very limited evidence that using a homeâ€exercise programme, for at least six months after receiving activity counselling and exercise advice, improved participation in physical activity in people with cystic fibrosis. No training program showed significant effects on quality of life. It is unknown whether strategies such as health coaching or Internetâ€based advice may help promote regular participation in physical activity in people with cystic fibrosis.",12,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,*Cystic Fibrosis; *Exercise; *Motor Activity; Adult; Child; Humans; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Time Factors,10.1002/14651858.CD009448.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009448.pub2,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,51.0
CD003884.PUB4,"Elphick, HE; Mallory, G",Oxygen therapy for cystic fibrosis,2013,"Abstract - Background The most serious complications of cystic fibrosis (CF) relate to respiratory insufficiency. Oxygen supplementation therapy has long been a standard of care for individuals with chronic lung diseases associated with hypoxemia. Physicians commonly prescribe oxygen therapy for people with CF when hypoxemia occurs. However, it is unclear if empiric evidence is available to provide indications for this therapy with its financial costs and often profound impact on lifestyle. Objectives To assess whether oxygen therapy improves the longevity or quality of life of individuals with CF. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Latest search of Group's Trials Register: 15 May 2013. Selection criteria Randomized or quasiâ€randomized controlled trials comparing oxygen, administered at any concentration, by any route, in people with documented CF for any time period. Data collection and analysis Authors independently assessed the risk of bias for included studies and extracted data. Main results This review includes 11 published studies (172 participants); only one examined longâ€term oxygen therapy (28 participants). There was no statistically significant improvement in survival, lung, or cardiac health. There was an improvement in regular attendance at school or work in those receiving oxygen therapy at 6 and 12 months. Four studies examined the effect of oxygen supplementation during sleep by polysomnography. Although oxygenation improved, mild hypercapnia was noted. Participants fell asleep quicker and spent a reduced percentage of total sleep time in rapid eye movement sleep, but there were no demonstrable improvements in qualitative sleep parameters. Six studies evaluated oxygen supplementation during exercise. Again, oxygenation improved, but mild hypercapnia resulted. Participants receiving oxygen therapy were able to exercise for a significantly longer duration during exercise. Other exercise parameters were not altered by the use of oxygen. Authors' conclusions There are no published data to guide the prescription of chronic oxygen supplementation to people with advanced lung disease due to CF. Shortâ€term oxygen therapy during sleep and exercise improves oxygenation but is associated with modest and probably clinically inconsequential hypercapnia. There are improvements in exercise duration, time to fall asleep and regular attendance at school or work. There is a need for larger, wellâ€designed clinical trials to assess the benefits of longâ€term oxygen therapy in people with CF administered continuously or during exercise or sleep or both. However, we do not expect any new research to be undertaken in this area any time soon and do not plan to update this review again until any new evidence does become available. Plain language summary Additional oxygen in the treatment of cystic fibrosis People with cystic fibrosis (CF) suffer from breathing problems. Giving additional oxygen has long been a standard of care for people with chronic lung diseases. It is common for doctors to prescribe this treatment for people with CF when there is not enough oxygen in their blood. We looked for evidence that this treatment improves the length and quality of life for people with CF. We found eleven studies with 172 participants to include in the review. All studies compared lowâ€flow oxygen to room air. Ten of the studies were shortâ€term. Four of the studies looked at giving additional oxygen at night. At night, oxygen levels rose during both rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and nonâ€REM sleep in those people breathing lowâ€flow oxygen. Participants breathing oxygen at night also spent less time in REM sleep and took less time to fall asleep. Six of the studies looked at the effect of extra oxygen on exercise. The levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood of participants increased during or after exercise when they breathed in lowâ€flow oxygen. People were able to exercise for longer if they breathed in lowâ€flow oxygen. There was more regular attendance at school or work in those receiving longâ€term oxygen. There is little evidence to support or oppose the longâ€term use of oxygen therapy in people with advanced CF lung disease. In the short term, treatment has shown some improvement in blood oxygen levels in people with CF during sleep and exercise. This increase in oxygen also came with an increase in carbon dioxide levels, which is probably not clinically important. However, caution needs to be exercised in those with advanced lung disease where this may require further monitoring. There should be research into the effects of longâ€term oxygen treatment on sleep quality and exercise in people with CF. Unfortunately, we do not expect that any such research will be undertaken any time soon, so we do not plan to update this review again until we find any new trials.",7,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Oxygen Inhalation Therapy [adverse effects]; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications, mortality]; Exercise Tolerance; Humans; Hypercapnia [etiology]; Hypoxia [etiology, mortality, *therapy]; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Sleep",10.1002/14651858.CD003884.pub4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003884.pub4,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,60.0
CD007298.PUB4,"Ferguson, JH; Chang, AB",Vitamin D supplementation for cystic fibrosis,2014,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder with multiorgan effects. In a subgroup with pancreatic insufficiency malabsorption of the fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) may occur. Vitamin D is involved in calcium homeostasis and bone mineralisation and may have extraskeletal effects. This review examines the evidence for vitamin D supplementation in cystic fibrosis. Objectives To assess the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the frequency of vitamin D deficiency, respiratory outcomes and vitamin D toxicity in the cystic fibrosis population. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 08 July 2013. Selection criteria Randomised and quasiâ€randomised controlled studies of vitamin D supplementation compared to placebo in the cystic fibrosis population regardless of exocrine pancreatic function. Data collection and analysis Both authors independently assessed the risk of bias of each included study and extracted outcome data (from published study information) for assessment of bone mineralization, growth and nutritional status, frequency of vitamin D deficiency, respiratory status, quality of life and adverse events. Main results Six studies (239 participants) are included, although only three studies provided data from 69 adults and children with cystic fibrosis for analysis. One study compared a single high dose of vitamin D (250,000 IU) to placebo at the time of hospital admission with a respiratory exacerbation in 30 pancreatic insufficient adults with cystic fibrosis. The second study compared supplemental 800 international units (IU) vitamin D and placebo for 12 months in 30 osteopenic pancreatic insufficient adults; both groups continued 900 IU vitamin D daily. The third study compared supplemental 1 g calcium alone, 1600 IU vitamin D alone, 1600 IU vitamin D and 1 g calcium and placebo in a doubleâ€blind randomised crossâ€over study; only nine children who completed both vitamin D and placebo groups after sixâ€months supplementation and a threeâ€month washout period are included; pancreatic sufficiency or disease status of participants are not defined. The studies are not directly comparable due to differences in supplementation, outcome reporting and possibly participant characteristics (e.g. severity of lung disease, growth and nutrition, pancreatic sufficiency). The only outcome for which we could combine data from more than two studies was 25â€hydroxyvitamin D levels; patients receiving vitamin D supplementation had significantly higher levels, mean difference 7.24 ng/ml (95% confidence interval 5.01 to 9.46). However, ironically one study reported 1,25(OH) 2 D with levels significantly favouring the placebo group, mean difference â€30.30 pmol/ml (95% confidence interval â€59.89 to â€0.71). Bone mineral density was measured in two studies; both described no significant change between groups. There were no adverse events in any study. The remaining three studies are published as abstracts only and did not provide data for analysis. These abstracts include: a report of preâ€intervention data in a study comparing daily calcitriol (0.25 or 0.5 micrograms) with placebo in pancreatic insufficient children and young adults; an interim report of a doubleâ€blind randomised control study comparing 5000 IU vitamin D daily for 12 weeks during winter in 67 adult cystic fibrosis patients; and a comparison of the effect of three months of vitamin D supplementation (dose not specified) with placebo on bone mineral density in 42 children with cystic fibrosis and low bone mineral density. Risk of bias was highly variable between all studies. Only one study had a low risk of bias for the five main criteria (random sequence generation, allocation, blinding, attrition and reporting). The rest of the studies had unclear or high risks of bias. Two studies had a low risk of bias for blinding and another two studies for attrition bias. In the studies published as abstracts, assessment of the risks of bias was uncertain in many aspects. Authors' conclusions In patients receiving vitamin D supplementation, 25â€hydroxyvitamin D levels are significantly higher. However, there is no evidence of clinical benefit or harm in the limited number of smallâ€sized published studies. Adherence to relevant cystic fibrosis guidelines on vitamin D supplementation should be considered until further evidence is available. Plain language summary The use of regular vitamin D preparations for children and adults with cystic fibrosis Cystic fibrosis with pancreatic insufficiency can mean that fatâ€soluble vitamins, such as vitamin D, are poorly absorbed. This can lead to vitamin deficiencies. Lack of vitamin D (vitamin D deficiency) can cause specific problems such as bone deformity and bone fractures. It may also be associated with poorer general and respiratory health. Therefore, people with cystic fibrosis are usually given regular vitamin D preparations from a very young age. However, excess vitamin D can also cause respiratory problems and problems with high calcium levels. The review contains six studies, however we could only analyse data from three of these studies. Three studies were only published as conference abstracts. The included studies varied greatly in quality, the amount of vitamin D administered, the duration of treatment and the outcomes that were measured. Three studies were in children and adolescents and three in adults. Few outcome data could be combined. The sole outcome that included data from two or more studies was vitamin D levels. Our analysis showed increased vitamin D levels in people who were given vitamin D supplements. For other outcomes, we found no evidence to show whether giving vitamin D regularly to people with cystic fibrosis is beneficial or not. We are unable to draw any conclusions about giving routine vitamin D supplements and recommend that, until more evidence is available, local guidelines are followed regarding this practice.",5,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Dietary Supplements; Adult; Bone Density Conservation Agents [*administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Bone Diseases, Metabolic [*drug therapy, etiology]; Calcifediol [blood]; Calcitriol [administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Calcium, Dietary [administration & dosage]; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications, metabolism]; Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency [complications]; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Vitamin D Deficiency [complications, drug therapy]; Vitamin D [*administration & dosage, adverse effects]",10.1002/14651858.CD007298.pub4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007298.pub4,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,148.0
CD001753.PUB3,"Dharmaraj, P; Smyth, RL",Vaccines for preventing influenza in people with cystic fibrosis,2014,"Abstract - Background Viral respiratory tract infections in people with cystic fibrosis have a deteriorating effect on their lung function and disease progression. Annual influenza vaccination is therefore commonly recommended for people with cystic fibrosis. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of influenza vaccination for people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also contacted the companies which market the influenza vaccines used in the trials to obtain further information about randomised controlled trials. Date of the most recent search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 08 July 2013. Selection criteria All randomised and quasiâ€randomised trials (published or unpublished) comparing any influenza vaccine with a placebo or with another type of influenza vaccine. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Additional information was obtained by contacting the investigators when it was indicated. Main results Four studies enrolling a total of 179 participants with cystic fibrosis (143 (80%) were children aged 1 to 16 years) were included in this review. There was no study comparing a vaccine to a placebo or a whole virus vaccine to a subunit or split virus vaccine. Two studies compared an intranasal applied live vaccine to an intramuscular inactivated vaccine and the other two studies compared a split virus to a subunit vaccine and a virosome to a subunit vaccine (all intramuscular). The incidence of all reported adverse events was high depending on the type of influenza vaccine. The total adverse event rate ranged from 48 out of 201 participants (24%) for the intranasal live vaccine to 13 out of 30 participants (43%) for the split virus vaccine. With the limitation of a statistical low power there was no significant difference between the study vaccinations. None of the events were severe. All study influenza vaccinations generated a satisfactory serological antibody response. No study reported other clinically important benefits. Authors' conclusions There is currently no evidence from randomised studies that influenza vaccine given to people with cystic fibrosis is of benefit to them. There remains a need for a wellâ€constructed clinical study, that assesses the effectiveness of influenza vaccination on important clinical outcome measures. Plain language summary Vaccines for preventing influenza in people with cystic fibrosis People with cystic fibrosis have blocked airways which results in frequent airway infections. Infections with viral diseases like influenza (""the flu"") can worsen lung damage. Doctors therefore often advise people with cystic fibrosis to be vaccinated against influenza every year. We searched for studies which compared different vaccines or compared vaccination to placebo. We were able to include four studies with 179 people in the review. Most (143) were under 16 years old. No study compared one vaccine to placebo. There were a high number of drop outs in two of the studies. Vaccination does result in an immune system response to the types of influenza used in the vaccine. However, this response may not result in protection against influenza infection or lung damage. There were a high number of adverse events, but none were serious or persistent. There is no evidence to show if regular influenza vaccine benefits people with cystic fibrosis.",3,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Influenza Vaccines [administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Humans; Infant; Influenza, Human [*prevention & control]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Vaccines, Attenuated [administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Vaccines, Inactivated [administration & dosage, adverse effects]",10.1002/14651858.CD001753.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001753.pub3,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,11.0
CD007641.PUB3,"Savage, E; Beirne, PV; Ni Chroinin, M; Duff, A; Fitzgerald, T; Farrell, D",Selfâ€management education for cystic fibrosis,2014,"Abstract - Background Selfâ€management education may help patients with cystic fibrosis and their families to choose, monitor and adjust treatment requirements for their illness, and also to manage the effects of illness on their lives. Although selfâ€management education interventions have been developed for cystic fibrosis, no previous systematic review of the evidence of effectiveness of these interventions has been conducted. Objectives To assess the effects of selfâ€management education interventions on improving health outcomes for patients with cystic fibrosis and their caregivers Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register (date of the last search: 22 August 2013). We also searched databases through EBSCO (CINAHL; Psychological and Behavioural Sciences Collection; PsychInfo; SocINDEX) and Elsevier (Embase) and handsearched relevant journals and conference proceedings (date of the last searches: 01 February 2014 ). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials, quasiâ€randomised controlled trials or controlled clinical trials comparing different types of selfâ€management education for cystic fibrosis or comparing selfâ€management education with standard care or no intervention. Data collection and analysis Two authors assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias. Three authors extracted data. Main results Four trials (involving a total of 269 participants) were included. The participants were children with cystic fibrosis and their parents or caregivers in three trials and adults with cystic fibrosis in one trial. The trials compared four different selfâ€management education interventions versus standard treatment: (1) a training programme for managing cystic fibrosis in general; (2) education specific to aerosol and airway clearance treatments; (3) diseaseâ€specific nutrition education; and (4) general and diseaseâ€specific nutrition education. Training children to manage cystic fibrosis in general had no statistically significant effects on weight after six to eight weeks, mean difference â€7.74 lb (i.e. 3.51 kg) (95% confidence interval â€35.18 to 19.70). General and diseaseâ€specific nutrition education for adults had no statistically significant effects on: pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume at one second), mean difference â€5.00 % (95% confidence interval â€18.10 to 8.10) at six months and mean difference â€5.50 % (95% confidence interval â€18.46 to 7.46) at 12 months; or weight, mean difference â€ 0.70 kg (95% confidence interval â€6.58 to 5.18) at six months and mean difference â€0.70 kg (95% confidence interval â€6.62 to 5.22) at 12 months; or dietary fat intake scores, mean difference 1.60 (85% confidence interval â€2.90 to 6.10) at six months and mean difference 0.20 (95% confidence interval â€4.08 to 4.48) at 12 months. There is some limited evidence to suggest that selfâ€management education may improve knowledge in patients with cystic fibrosis but not in parents or caregivers. There is also some limited evidence to suggest that selfâ€management education may result in positively changing a small number of behaviours in both patients and caregivers. Authors' conclusions The available evidence from this review is of insufficient quantity and quality to draw any firm conclusions about the effects of selfâ€management education for cystic fibrosis. Further trials are needed to investigate the effects of selfâ€management education on a range of clinical and behavioural outcomes in children, adolescents and adults with cystic fibrosis and their caregivers. Plain language summary Selfâ€management education for cystic fibrosis We set out to review the effects of selfâ€management education for cystic fibrosis on a range of health outcomes in individuals of all ages with cystic fibrosis and their caregivers. Our search for available evidence identified four trials, and all four compared a form of selfâ€management education to standard treatment. The precise focus of self management differed between trials and included a training programme for managing cystic fibrosis, education on chest treatments, education on nutrition specific to cystic fibrosis, and education on general and diseaseâ€specific nutrition. Selfâ€management education had no positive effects on lung function, weight, or intake of fatty food. There is some evidence to suggest that selfâ€management education improves knowledge about cystic fibrosis and its management in patients with this condition and some selfâ€management behaviours in patients and caregivers. However, due to the small number of trials in this review, and because of concerns about the quality of these trials, we are unable to reach any firm conclusions about the effects of selfâ€management education for cystic fibrosis. We recommend that further trials are conducted to evaluate the effects of selfâ€management education interventions.",9,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,*Nutrition Therapy; *Self Care; Adolescent; Adult; Caregivers [education]; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*therapy]; Humans; Parents [education]; Patient Education as Topic [*methods]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Young Adult,10.1002/14651858.CD007641.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007641.pub3,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,77.0
CD003148.PUB3,"Goldbeck, L; Fidika, A; Herle, M; Quittner, AL",Psychological interventions for individuals with cystic fibrosis and their families,2014,"Abstract - Background With increasing survival estimates for individuals with cystic fibrosis, longâ€term management has become an important focus. Psychological interventions are largely concerned with adherence to treatment, emotional and social adaptation and healthâ€related quality of life. We are unaware of any relevant systematic reviews. Objectives To determine whether psychological interventions for people with cystic fibrosis provide significant psychosocial and physical benefits in addition to standard medical care. Search methods Studies were identified from two Cochrane trials registers (Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group; Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group), Ovid MEDLINE and PsychINFO; unpublished trials were located through professional networks and Listserves.â€¨Most recent search of the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's register: 19 December 2013. Most recent search of the Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's register: 12 November 2013. Selection criteria Randomised controlled studies of a broad range of psychological interventions evaluating subjective and objective health outcomes, such as quality of life or pulmonary function, in individuals of all ages with cystic fibrosis and their immediate family. We were interested in psychological interventions, including psychological methods within the scope of psychotherapeutic or psychosomatic mechanism of action (e.g. cognitive behavioural, cognitive, family systems or systemic, psychoâ€dynamic, or other, e.g. supportive, relaxation, or biofeedback), which were aimed at improving psychological and psychosocial outcomes (e.g. quality of life, levels of stress or distress, psychopathology, etc.), adaptation to disease management and physiological outcomes. Data collection and analysis Three authors were involved in selecting the eligible studies and two of these authors assessed their risk of bias. Main results The review includes 16 studies (eight new studies included in this update) representing data from 556 participants. Studies are diverse in their design and their methods. They cover interventions with generic approaches, as well as interventions developed specifically to target diseaseâ€specific symptoms and problems in people with cystic fibrosis. These include cognitive behavioural interventions to improve adherence to nutrition or psychosocial adjustment, cognitive interventions to improve adherence or those associated with decision making in lung transplantation, a communityâ€based support intervention and other interventions, such as selfâ€hypnosis, respiratory muscle biofeedback, music therapy, dance and movement therapy, and a teleâ€medicine intervention to support patients awaiting transplantation. A substantial proportion of outcomes relate to adherence, changes in physical status or other specific treatment concerns during the chronic phase of the disease. There is some evidence that behavioural interventions targeting nutrition and growth in children (4 to 12 years) with cystic fibrosis are effective in the short term. Evidence was found that providing a structured decisionâ€making tool for patients considering lung transplantation improves patients' knowledge of and expectations about the transplant, and reduces decisional conflict in the short term. One study about training in biofeedbackâ€assisted breathing demonstrated some evidence that it improved some lung function measurements. Currently there is insufficient evidence for interventions aimed at other aspects of the disease process. Authors' conclusions Currently, insufficient evidence exists on psychological interventions or approaches to support people with cystic fibrosis and their caregivers, although some of the studies were promising. Due to the heterogeneity between studies, more of each type of intervention are needed to support preliminary evidence. Multicentre studies, with consequent funding implications, are needed to increase the sample size of these studies and enhance the statistical power and precision to detect important findings. In addition, multicentre studies could improve the generalisation of results by minimizing centre or therapist effects. Psychological interventions should be targeted to illnessâ€specific symptoms or behaviours to demonstrate efficacy. Plain language summary Psychological treatments to help individuals with cystic fibrosis and their caregivers manage the disease Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that damages many of the body's organs and can shorten a person's life span. The disease is progressive, stressful to manage, and needs complex and timeâ€consuming treatments, leaving patients and caregivers stressed due to the challenges of the treatment. Thus, individuals with cystic fibrosis and their family members often need help to cope better and to deal with their thoughts and feelings. They also need assistance in managing the demands of the prescribed treatment schedules. In addition, infection control guidelines recommend the isolation of people with cystic fibrosis from others with the same disease, leading to a lack of peer support and potential social isolation. We looked for studies of psychological treatments in individuals of all ages with cystic fibrosis and their families which aimed to reduce anxiety and depression, to improve adjustment, quality of life, and even medical outcomes, as well as knowledge, skills, and decisions regarding care. The review includes 16 studies with a total of 556 participants. Even though there many different psychological interventions, only a few have been evaluated for individuals with CF and their families. Due to the lack of high quality studies, it is not possible to currently show which psychological treatments are most helpful to those with cystic fibrosis and their caregivers. Five out of the 16 studies we found evaluated behavioural interventions to improve dietary intake. We found that in children aged 4 to 12 years receiving a nutritional intervention plus behavioural management training, consumed about 276 calories per day more than children just receiving the nutritional intervention. We also found that a structured decisionâ€making tool for adults considering lung transplantation improved their knowledge, assisted in setting realistic expectations, and reduced indecision. In summary, there is some evidence that behavioural interventions targeting specific illnessâ€related symptoms and behaviours can work. More studies on psychological interventions with more people are urgently needed. There are several ongoing randomised controlled studies aimed at improving adherence to prescribed treatments, but final results are not yet available. We recommend multicentre studies to provide evidence for which interventions are most effective for the key issues faced by people with cystic fibrosis and their caregivers.",6,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Adult; Caregivers [*psychology]; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*psychology, therapy]; Diet [psychology]; Family; Family Therapy [methods]; Humans; Patient Compliance [psychology]; Psychotherapy [*methods]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Therapy [psychology]",10.1002/14651858.CD003148.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003148.pub3,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,158.0
CD005087.PUB4,"Burrows, EF; Southern, KW; Noone, PG",Sodium channel blockers for cystic fibrosis,2014,"Abstract - Background People with cystic fibrosis (CF) have increased transport of the salt, sodium across their airway lining. Overâ€absorption of sodium results in the dehydration of the liquid that lines the airway surface and (along with defective chloride secretion) is a primary defect in people with CF. Objectives To determine whether the topical administration of drugs that block sodium transport improves the respiratory condition of people with CF. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We contacted principal investigators known to work in the field, previous authors and pharmaceutical companies who manufacture ion transport agents for unpublished or followâ€up data. Most recent search of the Group's register: 19 December 2013. Selection criteria Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasiâ€randomised controlled trials of sodium channel blockers compared to placebo or another sodium channel blocker or the same sodium channel blocker at a different dosing regimen. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data. Metaâ€analysis was limited due to differing study designs. Main results Five RCTs, with a total of 226 participants, examining the topical administration of the shortâ€acting sodium channel blocker, amiloride, compared to placebo were identified as eligible for inclusion in the review. In three studies over six months, there was a significant difference found in the difference in relative change in FVC in favour of placebo (weighted mean difference 1.51% (95% confidence interval â€2.77 to â€0.25), although heterogeneity was evident. A twoâ€week study demonstrated that hypertonic saline with amiloride preâ€treatment did not result in a significant improvement in respiratory function or mucus clearance, in contrast to preâ€treatment with placebo. There were no significant differences identified in other clinically relevant outcomes. Authors' conclusions We found no evidence that the topical administration of a shortâ€acting sodium channel blocker improves respiratory condition in people with cystic fibrosis and some limited evidence of deterioration in lung function. Plain language summary Drugs to control the movement of salt in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis Usually salt is absorbed from liquid on the surface of the lungs to stop fluid building up there. In cystic fibrosis too much salt is absorbed and there is little liquid left on the airway surfaces. As a result people with cystic fibrosis have problems clearing their lungs of sticky secretions. Thus the lungs are left open to infection. Drugs applied directly to the lungs may prevent too much salt being absorbed. This may lead to better clearance of mucus and less lung infection and damage. The review includes five studies with a total of 226 participants. All studies looked at shortâ€acting drugs applied directly to the lungs compared to placebo. When the results from three studies over six months were combined, the placebo group showed a slower rate of decline in forced vital capacity than the treatment group. However, each of these differed in their results. A further study showed that people receiving a sodium channel blocker before receiving hypertonic saline did not achieve better lung function or mucus clearance than those receiving placebo before hypertonic saline. We found no evidence that shortâ€acting sodium channel blockers administered directly to the lungs improve respiratory status in people with cystic fibrosis. There was even some limited evidence of a decline in lung function.

CD001399.PUB4,"Johansen, HK; GÃ¸tzsche, PC",Vaccines for preventing infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis,2015,"Abstract - Background Chronic pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis results in progressive lung damage. Once colonisation of the lungs with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  occurs, it is almost impossible to eradicate. Vaccines, aimed at reducing infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa , have been developed. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of vaccination against  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register using the terms vaccines AND pseudomonas (last search 30 March 2015). We previously searched PubMed using the terms vaccin* AND cystic fibrosis (last search 30 May 2013). Selection criteria Randomised trials (published or unpublished) comparing  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  vaccines (oral, parenteral or intranasal) with control vaccines or no intervention in cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis The authors independently selected trials, assessed them and extracted data. Main results Six trials were identified. Two trials were excluded since they were not randomised and one old, small trial because it was not possible to assess whether is was randomised. The three included trials comprised 483, 476 and 37 patients, respectively. No data have been published from one of the large trials, but the company stated in a press release that the trial failed to confirm the results from an earlier study and that further clinical development was suspended. In the other large trial, relative risk for chronic infection was 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.55 to 1.49), and in the small trial, the risk was also close to one. In the large trial, one patient was reported to have died in the observation period. In that trial, 227 adverse events (4 severe) were registered in the vaccine group and 91 (1 severe) in the control group. In this large trial of a vaccine developed against flagella antigens, antibody titres against the epitopes contained in the vaccine were higher in the vaccine group compared to the placebo group (P < 0.0001). Authors' conclusions Vaccines against  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  cannot be recommended. Plain language summary Vaccines for preventing infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of vaccinating people with cystic fibrosis to prevent infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Background Cystic fibrosis is a hereditary disease where thick mucus is produced in the lungs. This can stop the lungs clearing bacteria such as  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  and other bacteria. This causes longâ€lasting lung infections in approximately 80% of adult patients; these infections result in permanent lung damage. Vaccines have been developed which aim to reduce infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  and it is important to know whether using these vaccines can prevent lung infection. Search date The evidence is current to: 30 March 2015. Study characteristics We searched for vaccine trials where cystic fibrosis patients were selected at random to receive either an active vaccine or no vaccine (or a placebo, which is a dummy vaccine with no active medication). We also looked for trials comparing different types of vaccine or different schedules or doses of the same vaccine. We included three trials; two compared a  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  vaccine to a placebo and the third compared a vaccine to no vaccine. The two trials comparing a vaccine to placebo had 959 cystic fibrosis patients (483 in one and 476 in the other); the third trial recruited 37 patients with cystic fibrosis. The average age of the patients was about seven years in all three trials. All of the patients were free of infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  at the start of the trials and had a lung function of at least 50% of predicted for age. The two large trials followed the patients for two and four years, respectively; the small trial followed the patients for between 10 and 12 years. Key results We were only able to present the results from one of the large trials (483 cystic fibrosis patients) comparing an active vaccine to a placebo and the small trial (37 cystic fibrosis patients) with a no vaccination comparison group. Results for the second large trial have not been published, but the manufacturers stated that results did not confirm the findings from an earlier trial and that further clinical development had been suspended. The results we have from the two trials show that after vaccination the risk of getting a chronic infection did not decrease and lung function was similar in both groups of cystic fibrosis patients. One of the patients from the large trial died during the two year followâ€up period; in the small trial, one patient from each group had died after seven to eight years and by the end of the trial (10 to 12 years) six patients in each group had died. Those who died were all chronically infected with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Investigators in the large trial, recorded 227 adverse events (four of which were classed as severe) in the vaccine group and 91 (one of which was classed as severe) in the placebo group. The large trial also reported a rise in antibodies against  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  with no change in the placebo group. On the basis of these results, we cannot recommend the use of vaccines against  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in patients with cystic fibrosis. Quality of the evidence We did have some concerns that in the large trial which provided data for this review, the participants in the vaccine group were apparently older, taller and heavier than those in the placebo group. This may be due to pure chance, but the paper did not acknowledge this fact. We also had some concerns about how the cystic fibrosis patients in the small trial were randomised to the different treatments.",8,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Cystic Fibrosis [*complications, microbiology]; Humans; Pseudomonas Infections [complications, *prevention & control]; Pseudomonas Vaccines [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Pseudomonas aeruginosa [immunology]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",10.1002/14651858.CD001399.pub4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001399.pub4,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,90.0
CD001917.PUB4,"Balaguer, A; GonzÃ¡lez de Dios, J",Home versus hospital intravenous antibiotic therapy for cystic fibrosis,2015,"Abstract - Background Recurrent endobronchial infection in cystic fibrosis requires treatment with intravenous antibiotics for several weeks usually in hospital, affecting health costs and quality of life for patients and their families. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To determine whether home intravenous antibiotic therapy in cystic fibrosis is as effective as inpatient intravenous antibiotic therapy and if it is preferred by individuals or families or both. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Most recent search of the Group's Trials Register: 23 November 2015. Selection criteria Randomized and quasiâ€randomized controlled studies of intravenous antibiotic treatment for adults and children with cystic fibrosis at home compared to in hospital. Data collection and analysis The authors independently selected studies for inclusion in the review, assessed methodological quality of each study and extracted data using a standardised form. Main results Eighteen studies were identified by the searches. Only one study could be included which reported results from 17 participants aged 10 to 41 years with an infective exacerbation of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa . All their 31 admissions (18 hospital and 13 at home after two to four days of hospital treatment) were analysed as independent events. Outcomes were measured at 0, 10 and 21 days after initiation of treatment. Home participants underwent fewer investigations than hospital participants (P < 0.002) and general activity was higher in the home group. No significant differences were found for clinical outcomes, adverse events, complications or change of intravenous lines,or time to next admission. Home participants received less lowâ€dose home maintenance antibiotic. Quality of life measures showed no significant differences for dyspnoea and emotional state, but fatigue and mastery were worse for home participants, possibly due to a higher general activity and need of support. Personal, family, sleeping and eating disruptions were less important for home than hospital admissions. Home therapy was cheaper for families and the hospital. Indirect costs were not determined. Authors' conclusions Current evidence is restricted to a single randomized clinical trial. It suggests that, in the short term, home therapy does not harm individuals, entails fewer investigations, reduces social disruptions and can be costâ€effective. There were both advantages and disadvantages in terms of quality of life. The decision to attempt home treatment should be based on the individual situation and appropriate local resources. More research is urgently required. Plain language summary Intravenous antibiotics given at home for people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of giving antibiotics at home to people with cystic fibrosis. Background Cystic fibrosis is a serious genetic disease linked to recurrent lung infections. As a result of these infections, the person's lung disease becomes progressively worse. Lung infections are often treated with intravenous antibiotics (given directly into a vein) in hospital for a number of weeks. This is costly and disrupts the life of people with cystic fibrosis. Treatment can be given at home if patients and their carers are given enough training and support. We looked for randomised controlled trials which compared intravenous antibiotic treatment in hospital with treatment at home. This is an update of a previously published review. Search date The evidence is current to: 23 November 2015. Study characteristics We found one study with 17 people aged 10 to 41 years who had a flare up of infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa . The people taking part were assigned to either home antibiotics or hospital antibiotics at random. Those who had home antibiotics initially spent up to four days in hospital and were taught to prepare and administer their own intravenous antibiotics. They were discharged with enough medication and equipment for the course of treatment and were visited at home. All participants received the same type of antibiotic and the course lasted at least 10 days. Key results There were no differences found for clinical outcomes, adverse events, or complications linked to intravenous treatment. People at home were more tired and found the treatment more difficult to master. This may be due to them being more active and needing more support. Home therapy was cheaper for families and the hospital. There were no details about indirect costs. We conclude that treatment at home does not harm people in the short term and does reduce social disruption. However, the decision in favour of this option must be made on an individual basis. Quality of the evidence The evidence is very limited and more research is strongly needed to recommend its use.",12,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Adolescent; Adult; Anti-Bacterial Agents [*administration & dosage]; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Home Care Services [*economics]; Hospitalization [*economics]; Humans; Injections, Intravenous; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Tract Infections [*drug therapy, etiology]; Self Care; Staphylococcal Infections [*drug therapy]; Staphylococcus aureus",10.1002/14651858.CD001917.pub4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001917.pub4,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,88.0
CD008253.PUB4,"Beer, H; Southern, KW; Swift, AC",Topical nasal steroids for treating nasal polyposis in people with cystic fibrosis,2015,"Abstract - Background Nasal polyps frequently occur in people with cystic fibrosis. Sinus infections have been shown to be a factor in the development of serious chest complications in these people. Nasal polyps have been linked to a higher risk of lower respiratory tract infections with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  . Topical nasal steroids are of proven efficacy for treating nasal polyposis in the nonâ€cystic fibrosis population. There is no clear current evidence for the efficacy of topical steroids for nasal polyps in people with cystic fibrosis. This is an updated version of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of topical nasal steroids for treating symptomatic nasal polyps in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Latest search: 10 June 2015. Selection criteria Randomised and quasiâ€randomised controlled comparing the effects of topical nasal steroids to placebo in people with nasal polyps with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed risk of bias in the included trial and extracted data. Main results One singleâ€centred trial (46 participants) was identified comparing a topical steroid (betamethasone) given as nasal drops to placebo. Treatment was given twice daily for six weeks; 22 participants received the active drug. Subjective symptom scores, change in polyp size, and side effects were assessed. There was no difference in nasal symptom scores between the treatment and placebo groups. Betamethasone was effective in reducing the size of polyps, but was associated with increased reports of mild side effects, nasal bleeding and discomfort. Risk of bias was high since over 50% of people enrolled did not complete the study. Followâ€up of participants was short (six weeks) also reducing the significance of the results for clinical practice. Authors' conclusions This review suggests topical steroids for nasal polyposis in people with cystic fibrosis have no demonstrable effect on subjective nasal symptom scores. They have some effect in reducing the size of the polyps, but due to the small sample size, poor completion rates and lack of followâ€up, the trial is at high risk of bias and evidence for efficacy is limited. Overall there is no clear evidence for using topical steroids in people with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis. A wellâ€designed randomised controlled trial of adequate power and longâ€term followâ€up is needed. Validated measures of symptoms and physical findings should be performed and quality of life issues addressed. Plain language summary Steroids applied directly to polyps in the nose in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence on the effect of applying steroids directly to polyps in the noses of people with cystic fibrosis. Background People with cystic fibrosis often have polyps in their nose which can cause discharge and also a blocked nose. We know that people with cystic fibrosis and polyps in their nose also have more of some types of bacteria in their lungs. This can lead to serious chest complications later on. If we treat the polyps effectively at an early stage, we may prevent these chest complications. Steroid sprays or drops are often applied directly to polyps in the nose.These drugs are usually a safe treatment but can have some important side effects, like affecting the immune system and how the body can regulate blood sugar. They also add to the existing burden of treatment, especially if they need to be taken for the rest of a person's life. However, these drugs have been shown to be successful in treating polyps in people who do not have cystic fibrosis. Search date The evidence is current to: 10 June 2015. Study characteristics Our search found one trial with 46 adult volunteers with cystic fibrosis which compared nasal drops containing a steroid (betamethasone) to identical drops containing no active treatment. Two drops were applied directly to polyps twice a day for six weeks. Volunteers were put into the different treatment groups at random and a total of 22 volunteers received the steroid drops and 24 received the dummy treatment. Key results The trial measured each person's perception of their symptom scores, but found no difference to the scores whether volunteers were using the steroid drops or the dummy treatment. The trial also measured the change in polyp size and found that they shrank. There were no major side effects linked to using betamethasone, and only three volunteers reported increased nose bleeds and discomfort. The small number of volunteers in this trial means the calculations and results should be regarded with some caution. More trials are needed to confirm the findings and these trials should report on measures of symptoms and quality of life issues. Quality of the evidence We think that volunteers had a truly equal chance of being put in either the steroid group or the control group and wouldn't have known which treatment they were receiving, so these issues would not have influenced the results in any way. However, over 50% of people enrolled did not complete the study and the reasons for dropping out were not very clearly explained. We think it is important to take this fact into account when considering the trial results. Also, the trial only followed the volunteers for six weeks, which is a short time when evaluating a treatment that could be needed for the rest of a person's life.",6,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Administration, Intranasal [methods]; Adult; Betamethasone [*administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Glucocorticoids [*administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Humans; Nasal Polyps [complications, *drug therapy]",10.1002/14651858.CD008253.pub4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008253.pub4,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,24.0
CD009730.PUB2,"Hurley, MN; Prayle, AP; Flume, P",Intravenous antibiotics for pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis,2015,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis is a multiâ€system disease characterised by the production of thick secretions causing recurrent pulmonary infection, often with unusual bacteria. Intravenous antibiotics are commonly used in the treatment of acute deteriorations in symptoms (pulmonary exacerbations); however, recently the assumption that exacerbations are due to increases in bacterial burden has been questioned. Objectives To establish if intravenous antibiotics for the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis improve shortâ€ and longâ€term clinical outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews and ongoing trials registers. Date of last search of Cochrane trials register: 27 July 2015. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials and the first treatment cycle of crossâ€over studies comparing intravenous antibiotics (given alone or in an antibiotic combination) with placebo, inhaled or oral antibiotics for people with cystic fibrosis experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation. Data collection and analysis The authors assessed studies for eligibility and risk of bias and extracted data. Main results We included 40 studies involving 1717 participants. The quality of the included studies was largely poor and, with a few exceptions, these comprised of mainly small, inadequately reported studies. When comparing treatment with a single antibiotic to a combined antibiotic regimen, those participants receiving a combination of antibiotics experienced a greater improvement in lung function when considered as a whole group across a number of different measurements of lung function, but with very low quality evidence. When limited to the four placeboâ€controlled studies (n = 214), no difference was observed, again with very low quality evidence. With regard to the review's remaining primary outcomes, there was no effect upon time to next exacerbation and no studies in any comparison reported on quality of life. There were no effects on the secondary outcomes weight or adverse effects. When comparing specific antibiotic combinations there were no significant differences between groups on any measure. In the comparisons between intravenous and nebulised antibiotic or oral antibiotic (low quality evidence), there were no significant differences between groups on any measure. No studies in any comparison reported on quality of life. Authors' conclusions The quality of evidence comparing intravenous antibiotics with placebo is poor. No specific antibiotic combination can be considered to be superior to any other, and neither is there evidence showing that the intravenous route is superior to the inhaled or oral routes. There remains a need to understand hostâ€bacteria interactions and in particular to understand why many people fail to fully respond to treatment. Plain language summary The use of intravenous antibiotics to treat pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis Review question Do intravenous antibiotics (antibiotics given via a vein) given to treat 'flare ups' of lung disease (pulmonary exacerbations) in people with cystic fibrosis improve clinical outcomes in the short term and the long term? Background We wanted to evaluate the evidence for the current practice of using intravenous antibiotics to treat people with cystic fibrosis who have a pulmonary exacerbation. We wanted to discover if it is better to give two antibiotics than just a single antibiotic and wanted to consider if any particular antibiotic combination is better than any other. We also wanted to discover if intravenous antibiotics are any better than inhaled or oral antibiotics in treating pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis. Search date We last searched for evidence on 27 July 2015. Study characteristics The review included 40 studies with 1717 people with cystic fibrosis .  Studies compared intravenous antibiotics with placebo (dummy drug with no active medication) and also one antibiotic compared to two antibiotics given together. Specific antibiotic combinations were also compared as were intravenous antibiotics with antibiotics that were breathed in (inhaled) and antibiotics that were swallowed (oral). The studies lasted from three to 15 days, although most of the studies lasted for two weeks. Key results In the comparison between those people who were given just one antibiotic and those who were given two, it appeared that those receiving two antibiotics experienced a greater improvement in lung function, but when limited to only those studies that included a dummy drug, we did not see any difference. There was no effect upon the amount of time until the next exacerbation, weight, or adverse effects. No combination of antibiotics was any better than any other. The outcomes for people were the same irrespective of whether they were treated by intravenous, oral or inhaled antibiotics. None of the studies reported on quality of life. Quality of the evidence The quality of the included studies was often poor and many were not properly reported. Some studies included volunteers more than once which made comparing treatments difficult. It was also often difficult to decide from the information given how well the studies were carried out â€ particularly with respect to how volunteers were chosen and whether the volunteers or doctors could tell which treatment they were being given.",7,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Adolescent; Adult; Antiâ€Bacterial Agents [*administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*drug therapy, physiopathology]; Disease Progression; Humans; Injections, Intravenous; Total Lung Capacity [physiology]",10.1002/14651858.CD009730.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009730.pub2,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,31.0
CD000407.PUB4,"Cheng, K; Ashby, D; Smyth, RL",Oral steroids for longâ€term use in cystic fibrosis,2015,"Abstract - Background In cystic fibrosis (CF) airway obstruction and recurrent respiratory infection lead to inflammation, longâ€term lung damage, respiratory failure and death. Antiâ€inflammatory agents, e.g. oral corticosteroids are used since inflammation occurs early in disease. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of oral corticosteroids in respiratory complications in CF, particularly lung function and adverse events. We examined longâ€term use (over 30 days) only. Search methods We searched the Cochrane CF and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Most recent search: 28 August 2015. Selection criteria Randomised trials comparing oral corticosteroids given for more than 30 days with placebo or no additional therapy in people with CF. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and quality. Main results Of eleven studies identified, three (354 participants) were included: two with fourâ€year follow up and one with 12â€weeks follow up. Data were lacking on predefined outcomes; common outcomes were examined at different timeâ€points and presented differently. Metaâ€analyses were not possible. In one study, oral corticosteroids at prednisoloneâ€equivalent dose of 1 mg/kg alternate days slowed progression of lung disease; at two and four years, % predicted FEV 1  in the 1 mg/kg group changed significantly more than in the placebo group (P < 0.02). During the first two years, the 2 mg/kg group was not significantly different from the placebo group. Linear growth retardation was observed from six months in the 2 mg/kg alternate days prednisolone group and from 24 months in the 1 mg/kg alternate days prednisolone group. Adverse events terminated one fourâ€year study early. Year 10 follow up showed catchâ€up growth started two years after treatment ceased. Alternateâ€day treatment with oral corticosteroids may have impaired growth until adulthood in boys. Authors' conclusions Oral corticosteroids at prednisoloneâ€equivalent dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg alternate days appear to slow progression of lung disease in CF; benefit should be weighed against occurrence of adverse events. Riskâ€benefit analysis of lowâ€dose alternate days corticosteroids is important. No further trials of this intervention are anticipated, and hence the review will no longer be regularly updated. However, if any new data are published, these will be incorporate when available. Plain language summary Use of oral steroids for cystic fibrosis Cystic fibrosis causes frequent lung infection and the airways become blocked with mucus. This in turn leads to inflammation, which causes more lung damage and more mucus to be produced. Corticosteroids are strong drugs given to treat this inflammation. The review includes three trials; one for 12 weeks and two with fourâ€year follow up. We could not combine any data. Trials showed that oral steroids of 1mg/kg to 2 mg/kg (prednisolone equivalent) given every other day seemed to slow the advance of lung disease. However, there are serious adverse effects such as cataracts and the slowing of growth at the higher dose. These led to one trial stopping early. Followâ€up data show that catchâ€up growth started two years after treatment ceased. Treatment must use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration of therapy to reduce the risk of a permanent effect on growth. A dose of 1 mg/kg on alternate days might be considered for up to 24 months, but close attention should be paid to adverse effects. We do not expect any further trials of this treatment to be undertaken, so we do not plan to continue to regularly update the review. However, if any new information is published, we will include this when it is available.

CD008865.PUB4,"Burgess, L; Southern, KW",Pneumococcal vaccines for cystic fibrosis,2016,"Abstract - Background Invasive pneumococcal disease is associated with significant mortality and many countries have introduced routine pneumococcal vaccination into their childhood immunisation programmes. Whilst pneumococcal disease in cystic fibrosis is uncommon, pneumococcal immunisation may offer some protection against pulmonary exacerbations caused by this pathogen. In the USA and UK pneumococcal vaccination is currently recommended for all children and adults with cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the efficacy of pneumococcal vaccines in reducing morbidity in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. In addition, the pharmaceutical manufacturers of the polysaccharide and conjugate pneumococcal vaccines were approached. Date of the most recent search: 27 June 2016. Selection criteria Randomised and quasiâ€randomised controlled trials comparing pneumococcal vaccination (with either a polysaccharide or conjugate pneumococcal vaccine) with nonâ€vaccination or placebo in children or adults with cystic fibrosis were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis No relevant trials were identified. Main results There are no trials included in this review. Authors' conclusions As no trials were identified we cannot draw conclusions on the efficacy of routine pneumococcal immunisation in people with cystic fibrosis in reducing their morbidity or mortality. As many countries now include pneumococcal immunisation in their routine childhood vaccination schedule it is unlikely that future randomised controlled trials will be initiated. Rigorously conducted epidemiological studies may offer the opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of pneumococcal vaccination in reducing morbidity and mortality in people with cystic fibrosis. Plain language summary Pneumococcal vaccines for children and adults with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of vaccinating people with cystic fibrosis against infection with pneumococcal bacteria. Background Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease which causes mucus in the lungs to be more sticky than normal, leading to frequent lung infections and lung damage. Pneumococcus is a type of bacteria that can cause infection throughout the body. These infections can be very serious and may lead to severe illness and death. There are two types of vaccine that can help protect people against some forms of pneumococcus bacteria. One vaccine is used in children under two years of age and the second is used in older children and adults. This review aimed to find trials that compared vaccinations (either vaccine) to no vaccination or a vaccination with a placebo (dummy drug) to work out whether vaccinating against pneumococcus bacteria can reduce serious illness and death in people with cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published review. Search date Evidence is current to 27 June 2016. Study characteristics We did not find any relevant trials to include in this review. Key results The evidence to support the routine use of vaccines against pneumococcal infection is not strong; however, many countries now recommend that all children receive the vaccine as part of their childhood immunisation programmes.",9,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,Adult; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Humans; Pneumococcal Infections [*prevention & control]; Pneumococcal Vaccines [*therapeutic use],10.1002/14651858.CD008865.pub4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008865.pub4,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,15.0

Objectives To determine whether topical CFTR gene replacement therapy to the lungs in people with cystic fibrosis is associated with improvements in clinical outcomes, and to assess any adverse effects. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of most recent search: 05 May 2016. An additional search of the  National Institutes for Health (NIH) Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System (GeMCRIS)  was also performed for the years 1992 to 2015. Date of most recent search: 20 April 2016. Selection criteria Randomised controlled studies comparing topical CFTR gene delivery to the lung, using either viral or nonâ€viral delivery systems, with placebo or an alternative delivery system in people with confirmed cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis The authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality. Authors of included studies were contacted and asked for any available additional data. Metaâ€analysis was limited due to differing study designs. Main results Four randomised controlled studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, involving a total of 302 participants lasting from 29 days to 13 months; 14 studies were excluded. The included studies differed in terms of CFTR gene replacement agent and study design, which limited the metaâ€analysis. One study only enrolled adult males, the remaining studies included both males and females aged 12 years and over. Risk of bias in the studies was moderate. Random sequence generation and allocation concealment was only described in the more recent study; the remaining three studies were judged to have an unclear risk of bias. All four studies documented doubleâ€blinding to the intervention, but there is some uncertainty with regards to participant blinding in one study. Some outcome data were missing from all four studies. There were no differences in either the number of respiratory exacerbations or the number of participants with an exacerbation between replacement therapy or placebo groups at any time point. Metaâ€analysis of most respiratory function tests showed no difference between treatment and placebo groups, but the smallest study (n = 16) reported forced vital capacity (litres) increased more in the placebo group at up to 24 hours. A further study reported a significant improvement in forced expiratory volume at one second (litres) at 30 days after participants had received their first dose of favouring the gene therapy agent, but this finding was not confirmed when combined with at second study in the metaâ€analysis. The more recent study (n = 140) demonstrated a small improvement in forced vital capacity (per cent predicted) at two and three months and again at 11 and 12 months for participants receiving CFTR gene replacement therapy compared to those receiving placebo. The same study reported a significant difference in the relative change in forced expiratory volume at one second (per cent predicted) at two months, three months and 12 months. One small study reported significant concerns with ""influenzaâ€like"" symptoms in participants treated with CFTR gene replacement therapy; this was not reported on repeated use of the same agent in a larger recent study. There was no other evidence of positive impact on outcomes, in particular improved quality of life or reduced treatment burden. Two studies measured ion transport in the lower airways; one (n = 16) demonstrated significant changes toward normal values in the participants who received gene transfer agents (P < 0.0001), mean difference 6.86 (95% confidence interval 3.77 to 9.95). The second study (n = 140) also reported significant changes toward normal values (P = 0.032); however, aggregate data were not available for analysis. In the most recent study, there was also evidence of increased salt transport in cells obtained by brushing the lower airway. These outcomes, whilst important, are not of direct clinical relevance. Authors' conclusions One study of liposomeâ€based CFTR gene transfer therapy demonstrated some improvements in respiratory function in people with CF, but this limited evidence of efficacy does not support this treatment as a routine therapy at present. There was no evidence of efficacy for viralâ€mediated gene delivery. Future studies need to investigate clinically important outcome measures. Plain language summary Replacing the defective gene is a potential treatment for progressive lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of delivering the correct copy of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene directly to the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis in order to treat progressive lung disease. Background In cystic fibrosis the gene encoding a protein called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is faulty. People with cystic fibrosis suffer from progressive lung infection and damage which reduces life expectancy. Agents which can deliver a correct copy of the faulty CFTR gene to cells in the lungs may be an effective treatment. Search date The evidence is current to: 20 April 2016. Study characteristics We found four studies with 302 people to include in this review. The studies lasted from 29 days to 13 months. Three of these studies included both men and women aged 12 years and over and one study only included adult men. The studies compare gene therapy to a dummy treatment (placebo) both of which are inhaled as a mist into the lungs. The studies were of different designs and used different agents. This meant we could not combine their results. Key results Three of the studies, including the largest and most recent study, showed an improvement in some measures of lung function in people with CF given gene therapy. We did not find that any more clinically relevant outcomes such as quality of life, treatment burden or flareâ€up of lung disease had improved with treatment. In one study ""influenzaâ€like"" symptoms were more common in people who received CFTR gene transfer agents but this was not reported when the agent was used repeatedly in a larger study. In those people who took the gene transfer agents, molecules and salt in their lower airways moved more like they do in healthy people. The limited evidence of benefit does not support this as a routine therapy at present. We recommend that future studies are designed and reported clearly so that their results can be incorporated into a systematic review. Quality of the evidence The most recent study provided detailed information on how the people were put into different treatment groups completely at random, and so we are satisfied that those taking part in the study had an equal chance of being in either group (CFTR gene transfer agent or placebo) and that no one could work out which group the next person would be put into. The other studies reported that people were put into groups at random but did not specify how, so we cannot be sure that there was an equal chance of them being in either group. We believe that the clinicians running all the studies did not know which treatment the people taking part were receiving and that in three of the studies those taking part did not know either, but we could not be sure whether the people taking part in the latest study knew which treatment they were receiving and what effect this knowledge might have on results. Unfortunately, the studies did not report all their results clearly; sometimes results were not reported in a way that we could use for the review and sometimes they were not reported at all. This reduced the certainty with which we judged the overall results.",6,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Adolescent; Adult; Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator [*genetics, therapeutic use]; Cystic Fibrosis [genetics, *therapy]; Female; Gene Transfer Techniques; Genetic Therapy [adverse effects, methods]; Humans; Liposomes; Male; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Function Tests; Targeted Gene Repair [adverse effects, *methods]",10.1002/14651858.CD005599.pub5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD005599.pub5,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,3.0
CD007743.PUB6,"Robinson, KA; Odelola, OA; Saldanha, IJ",Palivizumab for prophylaxis against respiratory syncytial virus infection in children with cystic fibrosis,2016,"Abstract - Background Respiratory syncytial virus infection causes acute lung infection in infants and young children worldwide, resulting in considerable morbidity and mortality. Children with cystic fibrosis are prone to recurrent lung inflammation, bacterial colonisation and subsequent chronic airway disease, putting them at risk for severe respiratory syncytial virus infections requiring intensive care and respiratory support. No treatment currently exists, hence prevention is important. Palivizumab is effective in reducing respiratory syncytial virus hospitalisation rates and is recommended for prophylaxis in highâ€risk children with other conditions. It is unclear if palivizumab can prevent respiratory syncytial virus hospitalisations and intensive care unit admissions in children with cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To determine the efficacy and safety of palivizumab (Synagis Â® ) compared with placebo, no prophylaxis or other prophylaxis, in preventing hospitalisation and mortality from respiratory syncytial virus infection in children with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register and scanned references of the eligible study and related reviews. Date of last search: 05 May 2016. Selection criteria Randomised and quasiâ€randomised studies. Data collection and analysis The authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Main results One study (186 infants up to two years old) comparing five monthly doses of palivizumab (N = 92) to placebo (N = 94) over one respiratory syncytial virus season was identified and met our inclusion criteria. We judged there to be a low risk of bias with respect to the concealment of the randomization schedule (although it was not clear how this was generated) and to blinding of participants and study personnel. There is also a low risk of bias with regards to incomplete outcome data. However, we judged there to be a high risk of bias from selective reporting (summary statements presented but no data) and the fact that this industryâ€supported study has not been published as a full report in a peerâ€reviewed journal. At six months followâ€up, one participant in each group was hospitalised due to respiratory syncytial virus; there were no deaths in either group. In the palivizumab and placebo groups, 86 and 90 children experienced any adverse event, while five and four children had related adverse events respectively. Nineteeen children receiving palivizumab and 16 receiving placebo suffered serious adverse events; one participant receiving palivizumab discontinued due to this. At 12 months followâ€up, there were no significant differences between groups in number of  Pseudomonas  bacterial colonisations or change in weightâ€toâ€height ratio. Authors' conclusions We identified one randomised controlled trial comparing five monthly doses of palivizumab to placebo in infants up to two years old with cystic fibrosis. While the overall incidence of adverse events was similar in both groups, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions on the safety and tolerability of respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis with palivizumab in infants with cystic fibrosis. Six months after treatment, the authors reported no clinically meaningful differences in outcomes. Additional randomised studies are needed to establish the safety and efficacy of palivizumab in children with cystic fibrosis. Plain language summary Palivizumab vaccine for prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infection in children with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effects of vaccinating children with cystic fibrosis with palivizumab to prevent respiratory syncytial virus. Background Respiratory syncytial virus commonly causes lung infections in infants and children. Although cases are not severe in most children, children with cystic fibrosis may be at higher risk for severe lung infections from the virus. During a respiratory virus season, children with cystic fibrosis are more likely to need admitting to hospital and to experience a deterioration in lung function, compared with children who don't have cystic fibrosis. Palivizumab (Synagis Â® ) is a vaccine which has been shown to reduce hospitalisation rates due to respiratory syncytial virus in some high risk populations. Palivizumab is administered once a month for five months, beginning before the respiratory syncytial virus season each year. It is not yet known how effective and safe this vaccine is in children with cystic fibrosis. We looked for randomised controlled trials (trials where children are put into different treatment groups at random and then compared to each other) where palivizumab vaccinations were compared to either another preventive therapy or no preventive therapy in children with cystic fibrosis. Search date The evidence is current to: 05 May 2016. Study characteristics We found one study with 186 participants (infants with cystic fibrosis up to two years of age) which was run across 40 centres in the USA. Key results One infant (out of 92) who received palivizumab and one infant (out of 94) who received placebo were admitted to hospital due to infection from respiratory syncytial virus. No infants died. Overall, the number of adverse events in the palivizumab group was similar to that in the placebo group. No serious adverse events were reported to be related to the vaccine. Over the longer term (12 months), weight gain and the number of infections with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  (a common bacterial infection in cystic fibrosis) were similar between groups. The limitation of all these findings is that we only identified one study. More research is needed on the use of the palivizumab vaccination in children with cystic fibrosis. Quality of the evidence We thought there was a low risk that it would be know which treatment group the next participant would be put into, although it was not clear how this order was generated. We also thought that participants and study personnel were sufficiently blinded to the treatment to avoid bias and that any missing data were unlikely to bias the study results. However, we did have concerns about bias from selective reporting (summary statements were presented but without any data) and the fact that this industryâ€supported study has not been published as a full report in a peerâ€reviewed journal.",7,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Antiviral Agents [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Drug Administration Schedule; Humans; Infant; Palivizumab [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Pseudomonas Infections [epidemiology]; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections [*drug therapy]",10.1002/14651858.CD007743.pub6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007743.pub6,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,67.0
CD006838.PUB4,"Thornton, J; Rangaraj, S",Antiâ€inflammatory drugs and analgesics for managing symptoms in people with cystic fibrosisâ€related arthritis,2016,"Abstract - Background Arthritis remains a relatively infrequent complication of cystic fibrosis, but is a cause of significant morbidity when it does occur. Two distinct types of arthritis are described in cystic fibrosis: cystic fibrosisâ€related arthropathy (CFA) and hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPO). Management of arthritis in people with cystic fibrosis is uncertain and complex because of the underlying disease and its intense treatment. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To review the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological agents for the symptomatic management of cystic fibrosisâ€related arthritis in adults and children with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of most recent search: 19 January 2016. Selection criteria Randomised controlled studies which compared the efficacy and safety of antiâ€inflammatory and analgesic agents (e.g. nonâ€steroidal antiâ€inflammatory agents, systemic corticosteroids, intraâ€articular corticosteroids) with each other, with no treatment or with placebo for CFA and HPO. Data collection and analysis No relevant studies were identified. Main results No studies were included in this review. Authors' conclusions Although it is generally recognised that CFA may be episodic and resolve spontaneously, treatment with analgesics and antiâ€inflammatory agents may be needed. While this approach may be sufficient to manage symptoms, it is disappointing that no randomised controlled trials to rigorously evaluate these agents were found, nor could the authors identify any quasiâ€randomised. This systematic review has identified the need for a wellâ€designed adequatelyâ€powered randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological agents for the symptomatic management of cystic fibrosisâ€related arthritis (CFA and HPO) in adults and children with cystic fibrosis. Studies should also better define the two conditions. A study has recently been conducted in CFA and may help fill this gap when analysed and published. There are no trials included in the review up to January 2016. We will continue to run searches to identify any potentially relevant studies; however, we do not plan to update other sections of the review until new studies are published. Plain language summary The use of drugs to manage symptoms in people with arthritis related to cystic fibrosis Arthritis is not a common complication of cystic fibrosis, but it can be a major complication when it does occur. There are two distinct types of arthritis in cystic fibrosis: cystic fibrosisâ€related arthropathy and hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy. The best treatment for these conditions is not clear because of the underlying disease and its intense treatment. We planned to report evidence from clinical studies to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different antiâ€inflammatory analgesic drugs compared with placebo, with each other or with no treatment. However, we were disappointed that we could not find any completed randomised controlled studies of these treatments or any evidence from nonâ€randomised controlled studies. One study in cystic fibrosisâ€related arthropathy has finished and may provide some evidence when published. We suggest that there should be a randomised controlled study to look at the effects and the safety of using antiâ€inflammatory drugs or painkillers or both to manage the symptoms of cystic fibrosisâ€related arthritis. This is an update of a previously published review (date of last search 19 January 2016). Since no studies have been included in the review up until January 2016, we will still search for studies every two years, but will not publish an updated version of this review until we can include any new studies.",1,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Adult; Analgesics [*therapeutic use]; Anti-Inflammatory Agents [*therapeutic use]; Arthritis [*drug therapy, etiology]; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Humans",10.1002/14651858.CD006838.pub4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006838.pub4,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,18.0
CD008139.PUB4,"Jagannath, VA; Govindaraj Vaithinathan, AV; Fedorowicz, Z; Lee, TWR",Neuraminidase inhibitors for the treatment of influenza infection in people with cystic fibrosis,2016,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis is the most common, lifeâ€threatening, recessively inherited disease of Caucasian populations. It is a multisystem disorder caused by a mutation in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein which is important in producing sweat, digestive juices and mucus.The impaired or absent function of this protein results in the production of viscous mucus within the lungs and an environment that is susceptible to chronic airway obstruction and pulmonary colonization by a range of pathogenic bacteria. Morbidity and mortality of cystic fibrosis is related to chronic pulmonary sepsis and its complications by these bacteria. Influenza can worsen the course of the disease in cystic fibrosis by increasing the risk of pneumonia and secondary respiratory complications. Antiviral agents form an important part of influenza management and include the neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir. These inhibitors can limit the infection and prevent the spread of the virus. Objectives To assess the effects of neuraminidase inhibitors for the treatment of influenza infection in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Most recent search: 02 November 2015. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials and quasiâ€randomised controlled trials comparing neuraminidase inhibitors with placebo or other antiviral drugs. Data collection and analysis Two review authors had planned to independently screen studies, extract data and assess risk of bias using standard Cochrane methodologies. No studies were identified for inclusion. Main results No relevant studies were retrieved after a comprehensive search of the literature. Authors' conclusions We were unable to identify any randomised controlled studies or quasiâ€randomised controlled studies on the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors for the treatment of influenza infection in people with cystic fibrosis. The absence of high level evidence for the effectiveness of these interventions emphasises the need for wellâ€designed, adequately powered, randomised controlled clinical studies. Plain language summary Antiviral treatment for influenza infection in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We looked for evidence for the use of antiviral treatment against influenza infection in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Cystic fibrosis is a genetic, lifeâ€threatening disorder which affects many organs in the body. and people with cystic fibrosis have a higher risk of chronic lung disease. Influenza can worsen the course of the disease in cystic fibrosis by increasing the risk of pneumonia and secondary respiratory complications. During a pandemic (an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people), flu symptoms may be more severe and complications more frequent. Severe cases of pandemic flu have occurred in people with underlying chronic conditions including people with cystic fibrosis. Although there is no evidence that people with cystic fibrosis are more likely to contract this infection than healthy people, the impact for them could be greater and the outcome worse as the lower airways are more often affected. Antiviral agents are important in managing influenza and include the neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir. These drugs can limit the infection and prevent the spread of the virus. Search date The evidence is current to: 02 November 2015. Study characteristics We did not find any studies looking at the use of neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza in people with cystic fibrosis. Key results Limited data from previous studies have shown that these drugs can be effective in healthy people and may be useful in highâ€risk populations if used rationally. However, we are not able to answer the question of the safety and effectiveness of neuraminidase inhibitors for treating influenza in people with cystic fibrosis.",2,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Enzyme Inhibitors [*therapeutic use]; Humans; Influenza, Human [*drug therapy]; Neuraminidase [*antagonists & inhibitors]",10.1002/14651858.CD008139.pub4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008139.pub4,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,19.0
CD005405.PUB4,"Remmington, T; Jahnke, N; Harkensee, C",Oral antiâ€pseudomonal antibiotics for cystic fibrosis,2016,"Abstract - Background  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  is the most common bacterial pathogen causing lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis and appropriate antibiotic therapy is vital. Antibiotics for pulmonary exacerbations are usually given intravenously, and for longâ€term treatment, via a nebuliser. Oral antiâ€pseudomonal antibiotics with the same efficacy and safety as intravenous or nebulised antibiotics would benefit people with cystic fibrosis due to ease of treatment and avoidance of hospitalisation. This is an update of a previous review. Objectives To determine the benefit or harm of oral antiâ€pseudomonal antibiotic therapy for people with cystic fibrosis, colonised with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa,  in the:â€¨ 1. treatment of a pulmonary exacerbation; andâ€¨ 2. longâ€term treatment of chronic infection. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We contacted pharmaceutical companies and checked reference lists of identified trials. Date of last search: 08 July 2016. Selection criteria Randomised or quasiâ€randomised controlled trials comparing any dose of oral antiâ€pseudomonal antibiotics, to other combinations of inhaled, oral or intravenous antibiotics, or to placebo or usual treatment for pulmonary exacerbations and longâ€term treatment. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected the trials, extracted data and assessed quality. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing information. Main results We included three trials examining pulmonary exacerbations (171 participants) and two trials examining longâ€term therapy (85 participants). We regarded the most important outcomes as quality of life and lung function. The analysis did not identify any statistically significant difference between oral antiâ€pseudomonal antibiotics and other treatments for these outcome measures for either pulmonary exacerbations or longâ€term treatment. One of the included trials reported significantly better lung function when treating a pulmonary exacerbation with ciprofloxacin when compared with intravenous treatment; however, our analysis did not confirm this finding. We found no evidence of difference between oral antiâ€pseudomonal antibiotics and other treatments regarding adverse events or development of antibiotic resistance, but trials were not adequately powered to detect this. None of the studies had a low risk of bias from blinding which may have an impact particularly on subjective outcomes such as quality of life. The risk of bias for other criteria could not be clearly stated across the studies. Authors' conclusions We found no conclusive evidence that an oral antiâ€pseudomonal antibiotic regimen is more or less effective than an alternative treatment for either pulmonary exacerbations or longâ€term treatment of chronic infection with  P. aeruginosa . Until results of adequatelyâ€powered future trials are available, treatment needs to be selected on a pragmatic basis, based upon any available nonâ€randomised evidence, the clinical circumstances of the individual, the known effectiveness of drugs against local strains and upon individual preference. Plain language summary Oral antibiotics for treating infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We looked for evidence that antibiotics that are swallowed can treat  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  infections in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Treatment of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  lung infection is very important in managing cystic fibrosis lung disease. If oral (taken by mouth) antibiotics are as effective and safe for treating infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  as intravenous (given into a vein) or nebulised (breathed in as a mist) antibiotics the quality of life of people with cystic fibrosis would improve as it would be easier to administer the drugs administration and would avoid being admitted to hospital. We looked for trials in which people had equal chances of being treated with oral antibiotics or an alternative treatment for  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  infections. We thought the most important outcomes to find results for were quality of life and lung function. This is an updated version of a previous review. Search date The evidence is current to: 08 July 2016. Study characteristics We included five trials with 256 participants. Three trials included people experiencing a flare up of disease (171 participants) and two trials looked at longâ€term therapy (85 participants). Key results We found no conclusive evidence to show that oral antibiotics were more or less effective than an alternative treatment for either flare ups of disease or longâ€term treatment of chronic infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  One of the trials with volunteers being treated for a flare up of disease reported significantly better lung function when using ciprofloxacin compared with intravenous treatment; but we did not agree with this finding when we analysed the same data. We did not find any evidence of differences between oral antibiotics and other treatments in terms of adverse events or the development of antibiotic resistance, but we do note that the trials were not designed to detect such differences. Until the results of large trials are available, people should choose their treatment on a practical basis, basing decisions on any available evidence, their clinical circumstances, the known effectiveness of drugs against local strains of the bug and individual preference. Quality of the evidence The evidence we found was limited. The trials were very different in terms of design, drugs used, length of treatment and follow up and the outcomes measured. We judged the trials to be at different risks of bias, but we did not think any of them had a low risk of bias from blinding, which might affect the results of subjective outcomes like quality of life.",7,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Administration, Oral; Adult; Antiâ€Bacterial Agents [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Child; Chronic Disease; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications, microbiology]; Humans; Pseudomonas Infections [*drug therapy]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Tract Infections [*drug therapy, microbiology]; Treatment Outcome",10.1002/14651858.CD005405.pub4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD005405.pub4,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,2.0
CD000222.PUB4,"Cheng, K; Ashby, D; Smyth, RL",Ursodeoxycholic acid for cystic fibrosisâ€related liver disease,2017,"Abstract - Background Abnormal biliary secretion leads to the thickening of bile and the formation of plugs within the bile ducts; the consequent obstruction and abnormal bile flow ultimately results in the development of cystic fibrosisâ€related liver disease. This condition peaks in adolescence with up to 20% of adolescents with cystic fibrosis developing chronic liver disease. Early changes in the liver may ultimately result in endâ€stage liver disease with people needing transplantation. One therapeutic option currently used is ursodeoxycholic acid. This is an update of a previous review. Objectives To analyse evidence that ursodeoxycholic acid improves indices of liver function, reduces the risk of developing chronic liver disease and improves outcomes in general in cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane CF and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also contacted drug companies and searched online trial registries. Date of the most recent search of the Group's trials register: 09 April 2017. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of the use of ursodeoxycholic acid for at least three months compared with placebo or no additional treatment in people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality. The authors used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. Main results Twelve trials have been identified, of which four trials involving 137 participants were included; data were only available from three of the trials (118 participants) since one crossâ€over trial did not report appropriate data. The dose of ursodeoxycholic acid ranged from 10 to 20 mg/kg/day for up to 12 months. The complex design used in two trials meant that data could only be analysed for subsets of participants. There was no significant difference in weight change, mean difference â€0.90 kg (95% confidence interval â€1.94 to 0.14) based on 30 participants from two trials. Improvement in biliary excretion was reported in only one trial and no significant change after treatment was shown. There were no data available for analysis for longâ€term outcomes such as death or need for liver transplantation. Authors' conclusions There are few trials assessing the effectiveness of ursodeoxycholic acid. The quality of the evidence identified ranged from low to very low. There is currently insufficient evidence to justify its routine use in cystic fibrosis. Plain language summary Ursodeoxycholic acid for liver disease related to cystic fibrosis Review question Does ursodeoxycholic acid improve measures of liver function, reduce the risk of developing chronic liver disease and improve outcomes in general in people with cystic fibrosis? Background Problems with the consistency of bile (thickened) and how it flows cause liver disease in up to 20% of young people with cystic fibrosis. Bile ducts can become blocked and cause cirrhosis in one or more parts of the liver. Ursodeoxycholic acid is a naturally occurring bile acid which is taken as either a tablet or liquid to try and prevent liver disease in people with cystic fibrosis. The best response seems to be from a total dose of 20 mg/kg/day in two to three separate doses and given initially for several months but possibly indefinitely. Originally it was used to treat gallstones, but over the last few years it has been used to treat and prevent the progression of cystic fibrosisâ€related liver disease. This is an updated version of the review. Search date We last searched for evidence on 09 April 2017. Study characteristics We searched for trials of ursodeoxycholic acid lasting for at least three months and were able to include four trials, but data for analysis were only available from three of these. There are data from 118 participants aged between four and 32 years in this review. The dose of the drug given in the three trials with data ranged from 10 to 20 mg/kg/day. Two of these trials compared ursodeoxycholic acid to tablets with no medicine in them (placebo) and the third trial compared ursodeoxycholic acid to 'usual' treatment. The complex design of two trials meant data could not be analysed for all the participants. The trials lasted for up to 12 months, but no longer; however, one trial did report some followâ€up data after nine years. Key results Not many of the outcomes we listed in our review were assessed; only weight gain, skinfold thickness and biliary excretion. There were no real differences between treatments for any of these outcomes. Longâ€term outcomes that we think are important, such as death or the need for liver transplant, were only reported in the followâ€up of one trial and the information did not tell us if the people who died or needed a liver transplant had received ursodeoxycholic acid or placebo. Current research shows that side effects of this treatment are rare, but there is not enough information about using it in the longâ€term to justify routinely giving it to people with cystic fibrosis. As there is no other treatment to prevent liver disease, more research on ursodeoxycholic acid is needed. Quality of the evidence The trials seemed to be well organised and well run, but there was not always enough information to judge them properly. While, on the whole, we do not think that any factors linked to how the trials were run would influence the results greatly, we did have some concerns that in one trial the group taking ursodeoxycholic acid were generally not as healthy at the start of the trial as the group taking placebo. Also, in another trial there were some people who withdrew and were not included in the final analysis, but no reasons for this were given. Overall, we judged the quality of the evidence we found to be low or very low.",9,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Adolescent; Adult; Bile [metabolism]; Child; Child, Preschool; Cholagogues and Choleretics [*therapeutic use]; Chronic Disease; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Humans; Liver Diseases [etiology, *prevention & control]; Liver [enzymology]; Nutritional Status; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Ursodeoxycholic Acid [*therapeutic use]",10.1002/14651858.CD000222.pub4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD000222.pub4,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,95.0
CD012102.PUB2,"Smith, S; Edwards, CT",Longâ€acting inhaled bronchodilators for cystic fibrosis,2017,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis is a lifeâ€limiting inherited condition which affects one in 2500 newborns in the UK and 70,000 children and adults worldwide. The condition is multifaceted and affects many systems in the body. The respiratory system is particularly affected due to a build up of thickened secretions and a predisposition to infection. Inhaled bronchodilators are prescribed for 80% of people with cystic fibrosis in order to widen the airways and alleviate symptoms. Both shortâ€ and longâ€acting inhaled bronchodilators are used to improve respiratory symptoms. Shortâ€acting inhaled bronchodilators take effect in minutes and typically last for four to eight hours (muscarinic antagonists). Longâ€acting inhaled bronchodilators also take effect within minutes but typically last for around 12 hours and sometimes longer. This review is one of two which are replacing a previously published review of both longâ€ and shortâ€acting inhaled bronchodilators. However, due to the lack of research in this area, we do not envisage undertaking any further updates of this longâ€acting inhaled bronchodilators review. Objectives This review aims to evaluate longâ€acting inhaled bronchodilators in children and adults with cystic fibrosis in terms of clinical outcomes and safety. If possible, we aimed to assess the optimal drug and dosage regimen. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of last search: 10 October 2017. We also carried out a separate search of Embase and the reference lists of included trials. We searched clinical trials registries for any ongoing trials and made contact with pharmaceutical companies for any further trials. Date of Embase search: 11 October 2017. Selection criteria Randomised or quasiâ€randomised parallel trials comparing longâ€acting inhaled bronchodilators (betaâ€2 agonists and muscarinic antagonists) with placebo, no treatment or a different longâ€acting inhaled bronchodilator in adults and children with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Both authors independently assessed trials for inclusion (based on title, abstract and full text). The authors independently assessed the included trials for quality and risk of bias and extracted data. Discrepancies were resolved by a third party. Main results The searches identified 195 unique references, of which 155 were excluded on title and abstract. We assessed the full texts of the remaining references, excluded 16 trials (28 references) and included four trials (12 references) in the review with 1082 participants. One trial (n = 16) measuring the effect of betaâ€2 agonists reported an improvement in forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV 1 ) after treatment (at one month), but the trial was small with an unclear risk of bias so we judged the evidence to be very low quality. The trial did not report on participantâ€reported outcomes, quality of life or adverse events. Three trials (n = 1066) looked at the effects of the muscarinic antagonist tiotropium at doses of 2.5 Âµg and 5.0 Âµg in both the short term (up to 28 days) and the longer term (up to three months). Only one of the trials reported the change in FEV 1  (L) after 28 days treatment and showed no significant difference between groups; with 2.5 Âµg tiotropium, mean difference (MD) â€0.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) â€0.13 to 0.09), or 5.0 Âµg tiotropium, MD 0.00 (95% CI â€0.10 to 0.10) (moderateâ€quality evidence). All three trials of muscarinic antagonists provided data on adverse events which were found to differ little from placebo at doses of 2.5 Âµg, risk ratio (RR) 1.01 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.11) or 5.0 Âµg, RR 0.98 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.06). Very little participantâ€reported outcome data or quality of life data were available for analysis. Two of the trials were at low risk of bias overall whilst the remaining trial was at an unclear risk overall. Authors' conclusions Neither longâ€acting betaâ€2 agonists nor longâ€acting muscarinic antagonist bronchodilators demonstrate improvement in our primary outcome of FEV 1 . No difference was observed between intervention and placebo in terms of quality of life or adverse events. The quality of evidence for the use of betaâ€2 agonists was very low. The use of a longâ€acting inhaled bronchodilator may help to reduce the burden of treatment for people with cystic fibrosis as it is taken less often than a shortâ€acting inhaled bronchodilator, but future trials would benefit from looking at the effects on our primary outcomes (spirometric changes from baseline, quality of life and adverse effects) in the longer term. Plain language summary Longâ€acting inhaled treatment to open up the airways in cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence for the benefit of longâ€acting inhaled bronchodilators (treatment which opens up the airways often called ""relievers"") in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Cystic fibrosis affects many systems in the body, in particular how well the lungs work. There is a buildâ€up of thickened, sticky mucus which makes breathing more difficult and makes people with cystic fibrosis more likely to get infections in their lungs. Shortâ€ and longâ€acting bronchodilators are prescribed for most people with cystic fibrosis to widen the airways and improve symptoms. This review partly replaces an earlier review of both shortâ€acting and longâ€acting inhaled bronchodilators. However, due to the lack of research in this area, we do not plan to update this review of longâ€acting inhaled bronchodilators again. Search date The evidence is current to: 10 October 2017. Trial characteristics We included four trials in our review, with a total of 1082 people whose ages ranged from five months to 70 years. The trials included in the review looked at the effects of two different types of longâ€acting inhaled bronchodilator (betaâ€2 agonists e.g. salmeterol, and muscarinic antagonists e.g. tiotropium). The trials lasted between 28 days and 12 weeks. Key results The small trial of betaâ€2 agonists compared to placebo (no active medication) reported some improvement in lung function (forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV 1 )) after treatment, but did not provide data we could analyse. They did not report on any side effects. Only one of the three trials comparing tiotropium to a placebo reported on FEV 1  (measured in litres) and found little difference between treatment and placebo. Two of these trials reported on quality of life, but there was not enough evidence to comment on whether this improved or not. Three trials noted side effects, some of which were seen after treatment with tiotropium, but these symptoms were also seen in the group of people who were given placebo. Future trials would improve our knowledge if they measure side effects and quality of life in a more meaningful way. Quality of the evidence Only 16 people took part in the trial of the betaâ€2 agonist which only lasted for 28 days, which makes the results less reliable. The trials of muscarinic antagonists included 1066 people and the trials appeared to be well run. We don't think any design factors will have influenced the results in a negative way. None of the trials ran for more than 12 weeks which makes it difficult to comment on the effects over a longer time period.",12,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Administration, Inhalation; Adrenergic beta-2 Receptor Agonists [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]; Bronchodilator Agents [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]; Cystic Fibrosis [*drug therapy]; Disease Progression; Forced Expiratory Volume [drug effects]; Humans; Muscarinic Antagonists [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Time Factors; Tiotropium Bromide [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]",10.1002/14651858.CD012102.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012102.pub2,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,16.0
CD002769.PUB5,"Moran, F; Bradley, JM; Piper, AJ",Nonâ€invasive ventilation for cystic fibrosis,2017,"Abstract - Background Nonâ€invasive ventilation may be a means to temporarily reverse or slow the progression of respiratory failure in cystic fibrosis by providing ventilatory support and avoiding tracheal intubation. Using nonâ€invasive ventilation, in the appropriate situation or individuals, can improve lung mechanics through increasing airflow and gas exchange and decreasing the work of breathing. Nonâ€invasive ventilation thus acts as an external respiratory muscle. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To compare the effect of nonâ€invasive ventilation versus no nonâ€invasive ventilation in people with cystic fibrosis for airway clearance, during sleep and during exercise. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We searched the reference lists of each trial for additional publications possibly containing other trials. Most recent search: 08 August 2016. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing a form of pressure preset or volume preset nonâ€invasive ventilation to no nonâ€invasive ventilation used for airway clearance or during sleep or exercise in people with acute or chronic respiratory failure in cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Three reviewers independently assessed trials for inclusion criteria and methodological quality, and extracted data. Main results Ten trials met the inclusion criteria with a total of 191 participants. Seven trials evaluated single treatment sessions, one evaluated a twoâ€week intervention, one evaluated a sixâ€week intervention and one a threeâ€month intervention. It is only possible to blind trials of airway clearance and overnight ventilatory support to the outcome assessors. In most of the trials we judged there was an unclear risk of bias with regards to blinding due to inadequate descriptions. The sixâ€week trial was the only one judged to have a low risk of bias for all other domains. One single intervention trial had a low risk of bias for the randomisation procedure with the remaining trials judged to have an unclear risk of bias. Most trials had a low risk of bias with regard to incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. Six trials (151 participants) evaluated nonâ€invasive ventilation for airway clearance compared with an alternative chest physiotherapy method such as the active cycle of breathing techniques or positive expiratory pressure. Three trials used nasal masks, one used a nasal mask or mouthpiece and one trial used a face mask and in one trial it is unclear. Three of the trials reported on one of the review's primary outcome measures (quality of life). Results for the reviews secondary outcomes showed that airway clearance may be easier with nonâ€invasive ventilation and people with cystic fibrosis may prefer it. We were unable to find any evidence that nonâ€invasive ventilation increases sputum expectoration, but it did improve some lung function parameters. Three trials (27 participants) evaluated nonâ€invasive ventilation for overnight ventilatory support compared to oxygen or room air using nasal masks (two trials) and nasal masks or full face masks (one trial). Trials reported on two of the review's primary outcomes (quality of life and symptoms of sleepâ€disordered breathing). Results for the reviews secondary outcome measures showed that they measured lung function, gas exchange, adherence to treatment and preference, and nocturnal transcutaneous carbon dioxide .  Due to the small numbers of participants and statistical issues, there were discrepancies in the results between the RevMan and the original trial analyses. No clear differences were found between nonâ€invasive ventilation compared with oxygen or room air except for exercise performance, which significantly improved with nonâ€invasive ventilation compared to room air over six weeks. One trial (13 participants) evaluated nonâ€invasive ventilation on exercise capacity (interface used was unclear) and did not reported on any of the review's primary outcomes. The trial found no clear differences between nonâ€invasive ventilation compared to no nonâ€invasive ventilation for any of our outcomes. Three trials reported on adverse effects. One trial, evaluating nonâ€invasive ventilation for airway clearance, reported that a participant withdrew at the start of the trial due to pain on respiratory muscle testing. One trial evaluating nonâ€invasive ventilation for overnight support reported that one participant could not tolerate an increase in inspiratory positive airway pressure. A second trial evaluating nonâ€invasive ventilation in this setting reported that one participant did not tolerate the nonâ€invasive ventilation mask, one participant developed a pneumothorax when breathing room air and two participants experienced aerophagia which resolved when inspiratory positive airway pressure was decreased. Authors' conclusions Nonâ€invasive ventilation may be a useful adjunct to other airway clearance techniques, particularly in people with cystic fibrosis who have difficulty expectorating sputum. Nonâ€invasive ventilation, used in addition to oxygen, may improve gas exchange during sleep to a greater extent than oxygen therapy alone in moderate to severe disease. The effect of NIV on exercise is unclear. These benefits of nonâ€invasive ventilation have largely been demonstrated in single treatment sessions with small numbers of participants. The impact of this therapy on pulmonary exacerbations and disease progression remain unclear. There is a need for longâ€term randomised controlled trials which are adequately powered to determine the clinical effects of nonâ€invasive ventilation in cystic fibrosis airway clearance and exercise. Plain language summary A machine pushes air into the lungs helping people with cystic fibrosis breathe, clear mucus, reduce respiratory failure, improve exercise tolerance Review question We reviewed the evidence that mechanically pushing air into the lungs through a mask helps clear mucus, improves breathing overnight, reduces respiratory failure and improves exercise tolerance. Background As cystic fibrosis worsens, breathing becomes difficult, indicating the start of respiratory failure (too much carbon dioxide and not enough oxygen in the blood). As respiratory failure progresses, people may become breathless and have problems clearing mucus. Respiratory failure eventually results in death. Nonâ€invasive ventilation administers room air or oxygen through a mask and has been used to help people with more severe cystic fibrosis to clear their airways of mucus and improve breathing during sleep; it may also help with exercise. It is not certain exactly how this works, but it might reduce fatigue in the respiratory muscles, stop the airways from closing during prolonged exhalation and reduce the effort needed to maintain ventilation and oxygen levels. Treatment has been recommended when breathing muscles are weak, when a person has difficulty clearing mucus using other airway clearance techniques or when there are high levels of carbon dioxide in the blood during sleep or during exercise. This is an update of a previously published review. Search date Evidence is current to 08 August 2016. Study characteristics This review includes 10 trials (191 people with cystic fibrosis) â€ seven singleâ€treatment sessions and a twoâ€week trial, a sixâ€week trial and a threeâ€month trial. Six singleâ€treatment trials, the twoâ€week trial and the threeâ€month trial compared nonâ€invasive ventilation with other airway clearance techniques. Two singleâ€treatment trials and the sixâ€week trial looked at nonâ€invasive ventilation for overnight breathing support compared to oxygen or normal room air. One singleâ€treatment trial compared nonâ€invasive ventilation with no additional treatment during an exercise test. Key results Singleâ€treatment trials of nonâ€invasive ventilation for airway clearance showed that this may be easier with nonâ€invasive ventilation and people with cystic fibrosis may prefer it to other methods. We could not find evidence that nonâ€invasive ventilation increased the amount of mucus coughed up, but it did improve some measures of lung function, at least in the short term. The twoâ€week trial did not demonstrate clear benefits between groups. The original threeâ€month trial report stated an improvement in lung clearance index. One person in one of these trials reported pain on respiratory muscle testing. The three trials comparing overnight support from nonâ€invasive ventilation measured lung function, quality of life and carbon dioxide levels; they showed it is effective, safe and acceptable. We found no clear differences between nonâ€invasive ventilation and oxygen or room air, except for exercise performance which improved with nonâ€invasive ventilation compared to room air after six weeks. Two trials reported side effects. In the first trial, one person found the mask uncomfortable. In the second trial, one person in the room air group had collapsed lungs and two people could not tolerate increased pressure when breathing in. The trial comparing the effects of nonâ€invasive ventilation to no treatment on exercise capacity found no clear differences between groups. Nonâ€invasive ventilation may help alongside other airway clearance techniques, particularly when people with cystic fibrosis have difficulty coughing up mucus and during sleep. Longâ€term trials are needed with enough people to show the clinical effects of nonâ€invasive ventilation on airway clearance, during sleep and exercise training in severe disease. Quality of the evidence The benefits of nonâ€invasive ventilation have largely been demonstrated in singleâ€treatment sessions with only small numbers of people. There is limited evidence of some longerâ€term improvement in lung function in one trial. Our results from the trials of overnight breathing support differed from those in the original analyses, this is likely due to the small numbers of participants and some statistical issues. We judged only the sixâ€week trial to be free from any bias. In the remaining trials, we thought there were low or unclear chances of the results being affected because data were either reported only partially or not at all. We were not sure if the way in which participants were put into the different treatment groups would affect the results of the trials.",2,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,*Sputum; Cystic Fibrosis [*therapy]; Humans; Masks; Noninvasive Ventilation [*methods]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Insufficiency [prevention & control],10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,132.0
CD000406.PUB5,"Smyth, RL; Rayner, O",Oral calorie supplements for cystic fibrosis,2017,"Abstract - Background Poor nutrition occurs frequently in people with cystic fibrosis and is associated with other adverse outcomes. Oral calorie supplements are used to increase total daily calorie intake and improve weight gain. However, they are expensive and there are concerns they may reduce the amount of food eaten and not improve overall energy intake. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To establish whether in people with cystic fibrosis, oral calorie supplements: increase daily calorie intake; and improve overall nutritional intake, nutritional indices, lung function, survival and quality of life. To assess adverse effects associated with using these supplements. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register comprising references from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We contacted companies marketing oral calorie supplements. Last search: 18 October 2016. Selection criteria Randomised or quasiâ€randomised controlled trials comparing use of oral calorie supplements for at least one month to increase calorie intake with no specific intervention or additional nutritional advice in people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis We independently selected the included trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted the authors of included trials and obtained additional information for two trials. Main results We identified 21 trials and included three, reporting results from 131 participants lasting between three months and one year. Two trials compared supplements to additional nutritional advice and one to no intervention. Two of the included trials recruited only children. In one trial the risk of bias was low across all domains, in a second trial the risk of bias was largely unclear and in the third mainly low. Blinding of participants was unclear in two of the trials. Also, in one trial the clinical condition of groups appeared to be unevenly balanced at baseline and in another trial there were concerns surrounding allocation concealment. There were no significant differences between people receiving supplements or dietary advice alone for change in weight, height, body mass index, z score or other indices of nutrition or growth. Changes in weight (kg) at three, six and 12 months respectively were: mean difference (MD) 0.32 (95% confidence interval (CI) â€0.09 to 0.72); MD 0.47 (95% CI â€0.07 to 1.02 ); and MD 0.16 (â€0.68 to 1.00). Total calorie intake was greater in people taking supplements at 12 months, MD 265.70 (95% CI 42.94 to 488.46). There were no significant differences between the groups for anthropometric measures of body composition, lung function, gastroâ€intestinal adverse effects or activity levels. Moderate quality evidence exists for the outcomes of changes in weight and height and low quality evidence exists for the outcomes of change in total calories, total fat and total protein intake as results are applicable only to children between the ages of 2 and 15 years and many postâ€treatment diet diaries were not returned. Evidence for the rate of adverse events in the treatment groups was extremely limited and judged to be of very low quality Authors' conclusions Oral calorie supplements do not confer any additional benefit in the nutritional management of moderately malnourished children with cystic fibrosis over and above the use of dietary advice and monitoring alone. While nutritional supplements may be used, they should not be regarded as essential. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to establish the role of shortâ€term oral protein energy supplements in people with cystic fibrosis and acute weight loss and also for the longâ€term nutritional management of adults with cystic fibrosis or advanced lung disease, or both. Plain language summary Use of oral supplements to increase calorie intake in people with cystic fibrosis We reviewed the evidence for the use of oral supplements to increase calorie intake in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Cystic fibrosis affects many organs, including the digestive system, and can lead to food not being absorbed as it should be, which in turn leads to growth problems. Children with cystic fibrosis need more energy than other children, but they often have reduced appetites. Poor diet has been linked to poor outcomes in cystic fibrosis. Milks or juices containing additional calories are often added to the diets of children with cystic fibrosis to increase their total daily calorie intake and help them gain weight. However, these supplements are expensive and may not achieve the desired effect if patients take them as a substitute for calories consumed from food rather than as an additional component. In toddlers or young children use of supplements may risk compromising the development of normal eating behaviour. This is an updated version of the review. Search date We last searched for evidence on 18 October 2016. Study characteristics This review includes three randomised controlled trials with a total of 131 participants and two of them only included children. Two of the trials compared supplements to dietary advice and one compared supplements to no advice. The trials lasted between three months and one year. Key results There were no major differences between people receiving supplements or just dietary advice for any nutritional or growth measurements. This was also true for measures of body composition, lung function, adverse effects on the digestive system or people's levels of activity. Advice and monitoring appear to be enough to manage the diet of moderately malnourished children. Future trials should look into the use of calorie supplements for acute weight loss or longâ€term care for adults with cystic fibrosis. Quality of the evidence One of the trials appeared to be well run and the risk of bias was low for all the aspects of trial design that we assessed; so we do not think any bias will influence the results in a negative way. In the other two trials, we were not sure if the people taking part could guess which treatment group they were in. In one of these two trials, we further thought it was likely that the person recruiting them to the trial knew which group the participant would be in. In the second of these trials, the people in the group receiving supplements appeared to be generally in better clinical condition at the start of the trial than those who didn't receive any supplements or advice. These factors affect our confidence in the results from these trials. We judged the quality of the evidence for the changes in weight and height to be moderate, but judged the quality of the evidence for the changes in total calories, total fat and total protein intake as low since results are applicable only to children aged between 2 and 15 years; also many postâ€treatment diet diaries were not returned to the investigators. Evidence for the rate of adverse events in the treatment groups was extremely limited and judged to be of very low quality.",5,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Dietary Supplements [adverse effects]; *Energy Intake; Administration, Oral; Adult; Child; Child Nutrition Disorders [*diet therapy, etiology]; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",10.1002/14651858.CD000406.pub5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD000406.pub5,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,85.0

Anticoagulant treatment is preferably continued at the same dose, since dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism. The use of haemostatic measures during or after the procedure (or both) could enable continuation of the oral anticoagulant treatment. Objectives We aimed to assess the efficacy of antifibrinolytic agents for preventing bleeding complications in people on oral anticoagulants undergoing minor oral surgery or dental extractions. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Coagulopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. We searched PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library. Additional searches were performed using ClinicalTrials.gov, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), the CINAHL database of nursing and allied health services, the open access ProQuest dissertation database, papers and reports from the American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP) and abstract books from annual scientific conferences. Date of last search: 04 January 2018. Selection criteria Randomised and quasiâ€randomised controlled trials in people on continuous treatment with VKAs or DOACs undergoing oral or dental procedures using antifibrinolytic agents (tranexamic acid (TXA) or epsilon aminocaproic acid) to prevent perioperative bleeding compared to no intervention or usual care with or without placebo. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of all identified articles. Full texts were obtained from potentially relevant abstracts and two authors independently assessed these for inclusion based of the selection criteria. A third author verified trial eligibility. Two authors independently performed data extraction and risk of bias assessments using standardized forms. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Main results No eligible trials in people on continuous treatment with DOACs undergoing oral or dental procedures were identified. Three randomised trials and one quasiâ€randomised trial (followâ€up in all was seven days) in people on continuous treatment with VKAs were included with a total of 253 participants (mean age 60 years). Two trials published in 1989 and 1993 compared the antifibrinolytic agent TXA with placebo in people using VKAs. Two other trials were published in 1999 and 2015 and compared TXA with gelatin sponge and sutures, and dry gauze compression, respectively. In all included trials, those who were treated with VKAs had international normalised ratio (INR) values within the therapeutic range and TXA was applied locally, not systemically. The two trials from 1989 and 1993 comparing TXA with placebo showed a statistically significant beneficial effect regarding the number of major postoperative bleeding episodes requiring intervention, with a pooled risk difference (RD) of â€0.25 (95% confidence interval (CI) â€0.36 to â€0.14) (128 participants) (moderateâ€quality evidence). For the two trials that compared TXA with either gelatin sponge and sutures or with dry gauze compression, there was no difference between the TXA and the standard care group, RD 0.02 (95% CI â€0.07 to 0.11) (125 participants) (moderateâ€quality evidence). The combined RD of all included trials was â€0.13 (95% CI â€0.30 to 0.05) (moderateâ€quality evidence). There were no side effects of antifibrinolytic therapy that required treatment withdrawal (128 participants) (moderateâ€quality evidence). Despite heterogeneity between trials with respect to the different haemostatic measures used in the control groups, the trials were comparable regarding design and baseline participant characteristics. Overall, we considered the risk of bias to be low in the trials comparing TXA with placebo and moderate in the trials comparing TXA with alternative haemostatic measures. Authors' conclusions Based on the results of this Cochrane Review, there seems to be a beneficial effect of locally applied TXA in preventing oral bleeding in people on continuous treatment with VKAs undergoing minor oral surgery or dental extractions. However, the small number of identified randomised controlled trials, the relatively small number of participants included in the trials and the differences in standard therapy and treatment regimens between trials, do not allow us to conclude definite efficacy of antifibrinolytic therapy in this population. We were unable to identify any eligible trials in people on continuous treatment with DOACs undergoing oral or dental procedures. Therefore, a beneficial effect of antifibrinolytic therapy can currently only be assumed based on data from the people using VKAs. Plain language summary Drugs that prevent oral bleeding in people using oral anticoagulants undergoing minor oral surgery or dental extractions Review question We reviewed the evidence about whether antifibrinolytic medicine (drugs that prevent breakdown of a blood clot), such as tranexamic acid or epsilon aminocaproic acid, can prevent oral bleeding after minor oral surgery or dental extractions in people using oral anticoagulants (blood thinners that are taken by mouth) without interruption during the procedure. Background People on continuous oral anticoagulant treatment are at an increased risk of bleeding complications during and after oral surgery or dental extractions. There are two types of oral anticoagulant treatment: vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) (e.g. warfarin and coumarin) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) (e.g. dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban). DOACs are becoming an increasingly popular alternative for VKAs, traditionally used for preventing blood clotting in people at risk of thrombosis. The number of bleeds and the severity of each bleed depend on medicationâ€related factors (such as the degree of anticoagulation, measured by the international normalised ratio (INR)), surgeryâ€related factors (such as the size of the wound or the number of roots extracted), as well as patientâ€related factors (such as inflammation of the gums or blood vessel diseases). The INR level is important to determine how well the anticoagulant treatment is preventing blood clots. Within the desired range of the INR level, a person has both the least risk of blood clotting complications and the least risk of excessive bleeding. In routine practice antifibrinolytic medicine is often used before, during and after minor oral surgery or dental extractions for people using oral anticoagulants. The question is whether there is reliable scientific evidence for this practice. Search date The evidence is current to: 04 January 2018. Study characteristics We did not find any trials of antifibrinolytic medicine for preventing bleeding after minor oral surgery or dental extractions in people using DOACs. This review includes four trials (253 participants) in people continuously treated with VKAs during minor oral surgery or dental extractions. The earliest included trial was published in 1989 and the most recent one in 2015. The mean age of all participants was 60 years. The followâ€up time in all trials was seven days. Key results Overall, the included trials showed a reduction in the number of bleeds after dental extraction when using tranexamic acid solution in the mouth. Combining the results of the separate trials it appeared that antifibrinolytic medication reduces the bleeding rate after dental extractions by 25% when compared to placebo ('dummy' treatment). However, there was no difference in bleeding rate between people treated with tranexamic acid and those treated with standard care (e.g. gauze compression or stitches). Side effects of the antifibrinolytic medication rarely occurred and did not lead to individuals discontinuing tranexamic acid treatment. No evidence was found for people being treated with DOACs. It could, however, be argued that, if antifibrinolytic medicine is effective in people on continuous treatment with VKAs, it might also work for people receiving other comparable anticoagulant drugs. Quality of evidence In relation to the review's two primary outcomes of number of postoperative bleeds and side effects of therapy, we judged there to be moderateâ€quality evidence. In the two trials comparing tranexamic acid with placebo, the risk of bias, in relation to trial design, was considered to be low, in the two trials comparing tranexamic acid to standard care (gelatin sponge and sutures; or dry gauze compression) the risk of bias was considered to be moderate. This was mainly due to the lack of blinding (a way of making sure that the people involved in the trial do not know which trial arm they are assigned to) and inadequate allocation concealment (using the play of chance to assign participants to comparison groups to prevent selection bias) in two of these trials. There were differences between the trials with regards to different standard care treatments.",7,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Anticoagulants [administration & dosage, *adverse effects]; Antifibrinolytic Agents [*therapeutic use]; Humans; Middle Aged; Minor Surgical Procedures [*adverse effects]; Oral Hemorrhage [chemically induced, *prevention & control]; Oral Surgical Procedures [*adverse effects]; Tooth Extraction [adverse effects]; Tranexamic Acid [*therapeutic use]",10.1002/14651858.CD012293.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012293.pub2,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,35.0

Chronic, progressive lung disease is the most important cause of morbidity and mortality in the condition and is therefore the main focus of clinical care and research.  Staphylococcus aureus  is a major cause of chest infection in people with cystic fibrosis. Early onset, as well as chronic, lung infection with this organism in young children and adults results in worsening lung function, poorer nutrition and increases the airway inflammatory response, thus leading to a poor overall clinical outcome. There are currently no evidenceâ€based guidelines for chronic suppressive therapy for  Staphylococcus aureus  infection in cystic fibrosis such as those used for  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  infection. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the evidence regarding the effectiveness of longâ€term antibiotic treatment regimens for chronic infection with methicillinâ€sensitive  Staphylococcus aureus  (MSSA) infection in people with cystic fibrosis and to determine whether this leads to improved clinical and microbiological outcomes. Search methods Trials were identified by searching the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, MEDLINE, Embase, handsearching article reference lists and through contact with local and international experts in the field. Date of the last search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 09 February 2018. We also searched ongoing trials databases. Date of latest search: 20 May 2018. Selection criteria Randomised or quasiâ€randomised controlled trials comparing any combinations of topical, inhaled, oral or intravenous antimicrobials used as suppressive therapy for chronic infection with methicillinâ€sensitive  Staphylococcus aureus  compared with placebo or no treatment.

Main results The searches identified 58 trials, but none were eligible for inclusion in the current version of this review. Authors' conclusions No randomised controlled trials were identified which met the inclusion criteria for this review. Although methicillinâ€sensitive  Staphylococcus aureus  is an important and common cause of lung infection in people with cystic fibrosis, there is no agreement on how best to treat longâ€term infection. The review highlights the need to organise wellâ€designed trials that can provide evidence to support the best management strategy for chronic methicillinâ€sensitive  Staphylococcus aureus  infection in people with cystic fibrosis. Plain language summary Treatment for chronic  Staphylococcus aureus  chest infection in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We looked for evidence to see whether longâ€term antibiotic treatment for chronic infection with methicillinâ€sensitive  Staphylococcus aureus  (MSSA) in people with cystic fibrosis would lead to improved clinical outcomes and better results for measures of infection Background Cystic fibrosis is an inherited condition that causes thick mucus to build up in the lungs leading to persistent infection with bacteria. Methicillinâ€sensitive  Staphylococcus aureus  (also known as MSSA), is the name given to a particular bacteria which is a common cause of lung infection in people with cystic fibrosis. It can cause longâ€term infection in people with cystic fibrosis which leads to worsening lung function and poor overall clinical outcome. There are currently no guidelines based on trial results to inform clinicians how best to treat this infection in people with cystic fibrosis. This is an updated version of the review. Search date The evidence is current to: 09 February 2018. Study characteristics We found 58 trials in our searches, but could not find any which compared different treatments for this condition in people with cystic fibrosis. Therefore, none of these trials were eligible for inclusion in the current version of this review.

The date of the most recent literature searches: 19 June 2017. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled studies that compared two postural drainage regimens (standard and modified postural drainage) with regard to gastroesophageal reflux in infants and young children (up to and including six years old) with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently identified studies for inclusion, extracted outcome data and assessed risk of bias. We resolved disagreements by consensus or by involving a third review author. We contacted study authors to obtain missing or additional information. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Main results Two studies, involving a total of 40 participants, were eligible for inclusion in the review. We included no new studies in the 2018 update. The included studies were different in terms of the age of participants, the angle of tilt, the reported outcomes, the number of sessions and the study duration. The following outcomes were measured: appearance or exacerbation of gastroesophageal reflux episodes; percentage of peripheral oxygen saturation; number of exacerbations of upper respiratory tract symptoms; number of days on antibiotics for acute exacerbations; chest Xâ€ray scores; and pulmonary function tests. One study reported that postural drainage with a 20 Â°  headâ€down position did not appear to exacerbate gastroesophageal reflux. However, the majority of the reflux episodes in this study reached the upper oesophagus (moderateâ€quality evidence). The second included study reported that modified postural drainage (30 Â°  headâ€up tilt) was associated with fewer number of gastroesophageal reflux episodes and fewer respiratory complications than standard postural drainage (30 Â°  headâ€down tilt) (moderateâ€quality evidence). The included studies had an overall low risk of bias. One included study was funded by the Sydney Childrenâ€™s Hospital Foundation and the other by the Royal Childrenâ€™s Hospital Research Foundation and Physiotherapy Research Foundation of Australia. Data were not able to be pooled by metaâ€analysis due to differences in the statistical presentation of the data. Authors' conclusions The limited evidence regarding the comparison between the two regimens of postural drainage is still weak due to the small number of included studies, the small number of participants assessed, the inability to perform any metaâ€analyses and some methodological issues with the studies. However, it may be inferred that the use of a postural regimen with a 30 Â°  headâ€up tilt is associated with a lower number of gastroesophageal reflux episodes and fewer respiratory complications in the long term. The 20 Â°  headâ€down postural drainage position was not found to be significantly different from the 20 Â°  headâ€up tilt modified position. Nevertheless, the fact that the majority of reflux episodes reached the upper oesophagus should make physiotherapists carefully consider their treatment strategy. We do not envisage that there will be any new trials undertaken that will affect the conclusions of this review; therefore, we do not plan to update this review. Plain language summary Postural drainage in infants and young children with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about how different postural drainage positions affect gastroesophageal reflux in infants and young children up to six years old with cystic fibrosis. We compared standard postural drainage (includes headâ€down tilt) with modified postural drainage (includes horizontal positions and headâ€up tilt). This is an update of a previously published review. Background Although cystic fibrosis is a disorder that affects many organs, pulmonary disease is the most common cause of illness and death. Chest physiotherapy is recommended to clear the airways and improve lung function. Postural drainage is a type of chest physiotherapy used to treat children with cystic fibrosis. However, there is a risk of gastroesophageal reflux (the return of stomach contents back up into the oesophagus (throat area)) associated with this technique. Search date The evidence is current to: 19 June 2017. Study characteristics The review included two studies concerning 40 children with cystic fibrosis up to six years of age .  One included study used a 20 Â°  headâ€down tilt and headâ€up tilt of 20 degrees and the other used modified postural drainage (30 Â°  headâ€up tilt) compared to standard postural drainage (using a 30 Â°  headâ€down tilt). Children were randomly selected for one treatment or the other. One study was carried out over a 24â€hour period and the second over two days, but with a fiveâ€year followâ€up period. The age range of the participants varied from three weeks to 34 months. One included study was funded by the Sydney Childrenâ€™s Hospital Foundation and the other by the Royal Childrenâ€™s Hospital Research Foundation and Physiotherapy Research Foundation of Australia. Key results One included study using a 20 Â°  headâ€down tilt and 20 Â°  headâ€up tilt did not find differences regarding the number of gastroesophageal reflux episodes between the two postural drainage regimens whereas the other study found that modified postural drainage (30 Â°  headâ€up tilt) was associated with fewer number of reflux episodes and fewer respiratory complications than standard postural drainage (using a 30 Â°  headâ€down tilt) in infants with cystic fibrosis. The age of participants, angle of tilt, reported outcomes, number of sessions and study duration differed between the two studies. However, the use of a 30 Â°  headâ€up tilt seems to result in fewer reflux episodes and respiratory complications than a 30Â° headâ€down tilt position. Even though one study did not find differences between two techniques, in most of the reflux episodes stomach contents reached the upper oesophagus with a potential for choking. This should make physiotherapists carefully consider their choice of technique. We do not envisage that there will be any new trials undertaken that will affect the conclusions of this review; therefore, we do not plan to update this review. Quality of the evidence Both studies were of moderate (so we think further research could have an important impact on the results) quality and appeared to be well run and we do not think any factors will influence the results in a negative way.",3,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Anti-Bacterial Agents [therapeutic use]; Child, Preschool; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Disease Progression; Drainage, Postural [*methods]; Gastroesophageal Reflux [*etiology]; Head-Down Tilt [adverse effects, *physiology]; Humans; Infant; Lung [*metabolism]; Mucus [metabolism]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Time Factors",10.1002/14651858.CD010297.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010297.pub3,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,13.0
CD009421.PUB4,"Saldanha, IJ; Akinyede, O; Robinson, KA",Immunosuppressive drug therapy for preventing rejection following lung transplantation in cystic fibrosis,2018,"Abstract - Background For people with cystic fibrosis and advanced pulmonary damage, lung transplantation is an available and viable option. However, graft rejection is an important potential consequence after lung transplantation. Immunosuppressive therapy is needed to prevent episodes of graft rejection and thus subsequently reduce morbidity and mortality in this population. There are a number of classes of immunosuppressive drugs which act on different components of the immune system. There is considerable variability in the use of immunosuppressive agents after lung transplantation in cystic fibrosis. While much of the research in immunosuppressive drug therapy has focused on the general population of lung transplant recipients, little is known about the comparative effectiveness and safety of these agents in people with cystic fibrosis. This is the final update of a previously published review; no longer being updated due to a lack of research in the area. Objectives To assess the effects of individual drugs or combinations of drugs compared to placebo or other individual drugs or combinations of drugs in preventing rejection following lung transplantation in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register and scanned references of the potentially eligible study. We also searched the  www.clinicaltrials.gov  registry and the World Health Organisation (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) to obtain information on unpublished and ongoing studies. Date of latest search: 29 May 2018. Selection criteria Randomised and quasiâ€randomised studies. Data collection and analysis We independently assessed the studies identified from our searches for inclusion in the review. If we had found eligible studies to include in the review, we planned to independently extract data and assess the risk of bias. We planned to use GRADE to summarize our results through a summary of findings table for each comparison we could present in the review. Main results While five studies addressed the interventions of interest, we did not include them in the review because the investigators of the studies did not report any information specific to people with cystic fibrosis. Our attempts to obtain this information have not yet been successful.  Authors' conclusions The lack of currently available evidence makes it impossible to draw conclusions about the comparative efficacy and safety of the various immunosuppressive drugs among people with cystic fibrosis after lung transplantation. A 2013 Cochrane Review comparing tacrolimus with cyclosporine in all lung transplant recipients (not restricted to those with cystic fibrosis) reported no significant difference in mortality and risk of acute rejection. However, tacrolimus use was associated with lower risk of broncholitis obliterans syndrome and arterial hypertension and higher risk of diabetes mellitus. It should be noted that this wider review contained only a small number of included studies (n = 3) with a high risk of bias. Additional randomised studies are required to provide evidence for the benefit and safety of the use of immunosuppressive therapy among people with cystic fibrosis after lung transplantation. Plain language summary Drugs to suppress the immune system after lung transplantation in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed evidence to find out the effects of individual drugs or combinations of drugs when they are given to prevent donor lungs being rejected following transplantation in people with cystic fibrosis. We only considered randomised studies (where it is decided at random which drug volunteers are given) comparing individual drugs or combinations of drugs to a placebo (dummy treatment with no active medicine) or to each other. Background Lung transplantation is an available and realistic treatment option for people with cystic fibrosis whose lungs are severely damaged. However, as a natural defence mechanism, the body recognises a transplanted lung as foreign and activates the immune system to reject it. This is known as graft rejection. To prevent this, drugs are needed to suppress the immune system after lung transplantation. There are several different types of such drugs that act by suppressing different components of the immune system. Much of the research on such drugs has focused on all people who have had a lung transplant and not specifically on those with cystic fibrosis. Currently, clinicians do not all agree on a common way of using antiâ€rejection drugs in people with cystic fibrosis after they have received a lung transplant. Search date The evidence is current to: 29 May 2018. Study characteristics Although we found five studies which looked at antiâ€rejection drugs, they included people with a number of chronic conditions and not just cystic fibrosis. Key results The studies we found reported results from all volunteers combined and we were not able to isolate the results that were specific to people with cystic fibrosis. We contacted the researchers who conducted these studies, but they have not sent us the specific results we need.  There is a review of drugs to suppress the immune systems of people who have had lung transplants (not restricted to those with cystic fibrosis) and this only included three studies which the review authors judged to have a high risk of bias. The review did not find that any one drug was better than another for reducing the chances of death or acute rejection; but one drug (tacrolimus) led to a lower risk of longâ€term rejection and high blood pressure, although there was a higher risk of diabetes. Research is needed on the use of drugs that suppress the immune system in people with cystic fibrosis who have received a lung transplant. Due to the lack of research in this area, we do not plan to update this review again.",6,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,*Lung Transplantation; Cystic Fibrosis [*surgery]; Graft Rejection [*prevention & control]; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents [*therapeutic use],10.1002/14651858.CD009421.pub4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009421.pub4,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,13.0
CD006751.PUB5,"de Vries, JJV; Chang, AB; Bonifant, CM; Shevill, E; Marchant, JM",Vitamin A and beta (Î²)â€carotene supplementation for cystic fibrosis,2018,"Abstract - Background People with cystic fibrosis (CF) and pancreatic insufficiency are at risk of a deficiency in fatâ€soluble vitamins, including vitamin A. Vitamin A deficiency predominantly causes eye and skin problems, while excessive levels of vitamin A can harm the respiratory and skeletal systems in children and interfere with the metabolism of other fatâ€soluble vitamins. Most CF centres administer vitamin A as supplements to reduce the frequency of vitamin A deficiency in people with CF and to improve clinical outcomes such as growth, although the recommended dose varies between different guidelines. Thus, a systematic review on vitamin A and vitamin Aâ€like supplementation (carotenes or other retinoids) in people with CF would help guide clinical practice. This is an update of an earlier Cochrane Review. Objectives To determine if supplementation with vitamin A, carotenes or other retinoid supplements in children and adults with CF reduces the frequency of vitamin A deficiency disorders, improves general and respiratory health and affects the frequency of vitamin A toxicity. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Additionally we searched several ongoing trials registries, including ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Registry. Most recent database searches: 01 June 2018. Selection criteria All randomised or quasiâ€randomised controlled studies comparing all preparations of oral vitamin A, carotenes or retinoids (or in combination), used as a supplement compared to placebo at any dose, for at least three months, in people with CF (diagnosed by sweat tests or genetic testing) with and without pancreatic insufficiency. Data collection and analysis Two authors individually assessed study quality and extracted data on outcome measures. The authors assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE system. Investigators were contacted to retrieve missing quantitative data. Main results No studies of vitamin A or other retinoid supplementation were eligible for inclusion. However, one randomised study of beta (Î²)â€carotene supplementation involving 24 people with CF who were receiving pancreatic enzyme substitution was included. The study compared successive Î²â€carotene supplementation periods (high dose followed by low dose) compared to placebo. The results for the lowâ€dose supplementation period should be interpreted with caution, due to the lack of a washâ€out period after the highâ€dose supplementation. The included study did not report on two of the review's primary outcomes (vitamin A deficiency disorders and mortality); results for our third primary outcome of growth and nutritional status (reported as z score for height) showed no difference between supplementation and placebo, mean difference (MD) â€0.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) â€0.89 to 0.43) (lowâ€quality evidence). With regards to secondary outcomes, supplementation with highâ€dose Î²â€carotene for three months led to significantly fewer days of systemic antibiotics required to treat pulmonary exacerbations, compared to controls, MD â€15 days (95% CI â€27.60 to â€2.40); however, this was not maintained in the second threeâ€month section of the study when the level of Î²â€carotene supplementation was reduced, MD â€8 days (95% CI â€18.80 to 2.80) (lowâ€quality evidence). There were no statistically significant effects between groups in lung function (lowâ€quality evidence) and no adverse events were observed (lowâ€quality evidence). Supplementation affected levels of Î²â€carotene in plasma, but not vitamin A levels. The study did not report on quality of life or toxicity. Authors' conclusions Since no randomised or quasiâ€randomised controlled studies on retinoid supplementation were identified, no conclusion on the supplementation of vitamin A in people with CF can be drawn. Additionally, due to methodological limitations in the included study, also reflected in the lowâ€quality evidence judged following the specific evidence grading system (GRADE), no clear conclusions on Î²â€carotene supplementation can be drawn. Until further data are available, countryâ€ or regionâ€specific guidelines regarding these practices should be followed. Plain language summary The use of regular vitamin A or vitamin Aâ€like preparations for children and adults with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence regarding the effect of regular vitamin A or vitamin Aâ€like (carotenes or other retinoids) supplements in children and adults with cystic fibrosis. Background In people with cystic fibrosis only a small proportion of some vitamins, such as vitamin A, may be absorbed by the body and lead to problems caused by vitamin deficiency. A lack of vitamin A (vitamin A deficiency) can cause eye and skin problems and is associated with poorer general and respiratory health. Therefore, people with cystic fibrosis are usually supplemented with regular vitamin A preparations from a very young age. However, too much vitamin A can cause bone and liver problems. Excessive carotene levels are known to cause carotenaemia, a harmless, reversible yellowing of the skin, whilst a lack of carotene is not known to cause adverse manifestations in individuals with normal vitamin A levels. Search date The evidence is current to: 01 June 2018. Study characteristics No studies comparing vitamin A or other retinoid supplements to placebo (dummy drug containing no vitamin A) were included, but we did find one study comparing betaâ€carotene supplementation (a precursor of vitamin A) to placebo. A total of 24 people with cystic fibrosis (aged 6.7 to 27.7 years) were put into groups at random and treated either with Î²â€carotene capsules (at a high dose for three months followed by a low dose for a further three months) or with placebo (for six months). Key results No studies on vitamin A supplementation were included in this review. The single included study revealed that highâ€dose betaâ€carotene supplementation for three months led to fewer days on which people with CF required antibiotics compared to placebo, but this was not the case in the following threeâ€month section of the study when lowâ€dose betaâ€carotene supplementation was compared to placebo. Other clinical outcome measures (growth, nutritional status and lung function) showed no statistical significant differences between treatment and placebo groups. No side effects were observed. The other outcomes in this review, such as vitamin A deficiency symptoms, mortality, toxicity and quality of life, were not reported. Quality of the evidence We could only include one study in this review and that study had several limitations. This is reflected in the assessment of lowâ€quality evidence, judged using the specific evidence grading system (GRADE). So, we feel that the strength of evidence is low. Not all outcome measures were reported after each supplementation dose and results should be viewed with some caution as some betaâ€carotene from the highâ€dose period was probably still present in the blood during the lowâ€dose supplementation period. Conclusions Since no studies on vitamin A supplementation were included in the review, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the routine use of vitamin A supplements. Due to limitations of the included study of betaâ€carotene supplementation, no definitive conclusions regarding its use can be drawn either. Until further evidence is available, local guidelines should be followed regarding supplementation.",8,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Humans; Provitamins [*administration & dosage]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Vitamin A Deficiency [*prevention & control]; Vitamin A [*administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Vitamins [*administration & dosage, adverse effects]; beta Carotene [*administration & dosage]",10.1002/14651858.CD006751.pub5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006751.pub5,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,50.0
CD001198.PUB5,"Shimmin, D; Lowdon, J; Remmington, T",Enteral tube feeding for cystic fibrosis,2019,"Abstract - Background Enteral tube feeding is routinely used in many cystic fibrosis centres when oral dietary and supplement intake has failed to achieve an adequate nutritional status. The use of this method of feeding is assessed on an individual basis taking into consideration the patients age and clinical status. This is a final update of a previously published review. Objectives To examine the evidence that in people with cystic fibrosis, supplemental enteral tube feeding improves nutritional status, respiratory function, and quality of life without significant adverse effects. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also contacted the companies that market enteral feeds and reviewed their databases. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 10 July 2019. Date of the most recent hand search of PubMed: 26 October 2018. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials comparing supplemental enteral tube feeding for one month or longer with no specific intervention in people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis The searches identified 44 trials; however, none were eligible for inclusion in this review. Main results There are no trials included in this review. Authors' conclusions Supplemental enteral tube feeding is widely used throughout the world to improve nutritional status in people with cystic fibrosis. The methods mostly used, nasogastric or gastrostomy feeding, are expensive and may have a negative effect on selfâ€esteem and body image. Reported use of enteral tube feeding suggests that it results in nutritional and respiratory improvement; but, efficacy has not been fully assessed by randomised controlled trials. It is acknowledged, however, that performing a randomised controlled trial would be difficult due to the ethics of withholding an intervention in a group of people whose nutritional status necessitates it. Plain language summary Tube feeding (mainly via the nose into the stomach or directly into the stomach) in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We planned to review the evidence about the effects of tube feeding (via either the nose or the stomach) in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Cystic fibrosis is an inherited condition which causes damage to the lungs and pancreas (an organ needed to produce chemicals that help to digest food). People with cystic fibrosis often need more calories in order to achieve a good nutritional status because their condition means food is not absorbed well and they burn more energy at rest and when breathing than people who don't have cystic fibrosis. They also often have poor appetites. Supplements are often given via a tube which is either placed through the nose into the stomach (nasogastric feeding) or directly into the stomach (gastrostomy feeding)), often overnight but sometimes during the day too. This type of feeding helps to improve weight gain, nutritional status, lung function and may improve quality of life. This is important as it is known that in cystic fibrosis nutritional status is closely linked to lung function. However, tube feeding is expensive and may also impact on selfâ€esteem and body image. Tubes through the nose may also become dislodged by coughing. Tube feeding may also cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, but these issues are usually resolved by either changing the type of feed, the rate of feeding or the way pancreatic enzymes are given. This is a final update of a previously published review. Search date We last searched for evidence on: 22 October 2018. Study characteristics We found 44 trials in our searches, but none matched the design and duration of the trials we wanted to examine. We therefore did not include any trials in this review. Key results Ideally, more research is needed to compare tube feeding with oral supplements and with normal diet. New trials should also look at when tube feeding should be started for the best results. These trials may be difficult to run as it may be wrong not to provide people with the extra calories they need, and when they need them, in this way.",7,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,Cystic Fibrosis [*therapy]; Dietary Supplements; Enteral Nutrition [*methods]; Humans; Nutritional Status; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic,10.1002/14651858.CD001198.pub5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001198.pub5,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,70.0
CD008036.PUB5,"Irons, JY; Petocz, P; Kenny, DT; Chang, AB",Singing as an adjunct therapy for children and adults with cystic fibrosis,2019,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis is a genetically inherited, lifeâ€threatening condition that affects major organs. The management of cystic fibrosis involves a multiâ€faceted daily treatment regimen that includes airway clearance techniques, pancreatic enzymes and other medications. Previous studies have found that compliance with this intensive treatment is poor, especially among adolescents. Because of both the nature and consequences of the illness and the relentless demands of the treatment, many individuals with cystic fibrosis have a poor quality of life. Anecdotal reports suggest that singing may provide both appropriate exercise for the whole respiratory system and a means of emotional expression which may enhance quality of life. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To evaluate the effects of singing as an adjunct therapy to standard treatment on the quality of life, morbidity, respiratory muscle strength and pulmonary function of children and adults with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Date of latest search: 07 January 2019. We also searched major allied complementary data bases, and clinical trial registers. Additionally, we handsearched relevant conference proceedings and journals. Date of latest search: 28 March 2019. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials in which singing (as an adjunct intervention) is compared with either a control intervention (for example, playing computer games or doing craft activities) or no singing in people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Results of searches were reviewed against preâ€determined criteria for inclusion. Only one eligible trial was available for analysis. Main results Since only one small study (n = 40) was included, no metaâ€analysis could be performed. The included randomised controlled study was of parallel design and undertaken at two paediatric hospitals in Australia. The study evaluated the effects of a singing program on the quality of life and respiratory muscle strength of hospitalised children with cystic fibrosis (mean age 11.6 years, 35% male). While the singing group received eight individual singing sessions, the control group participated in preferred recreational activities, such as playing computer games or watching movies. This study was limited by a small sample size (51 participants) and a high dropâ€out rate (21%).  There were no differences between the groups at either postâ€intervention or followâ€up; although by the end of treatment there were some improvements in some of the domains of the quality of life questionnaire Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaireâ€Revised (e.g. emotional, social and vitality domains) for both singing and control groups. For the respiratory muscle strength indices, maximal expiratory pressure at followâ€up (six to eight weeks postâ€intervention) was higher in the singing group, mean difference 25.80 (95% confidence interval 5.94 to 45.66). There was no difference between groups for any of the other respiratory function parameters (maximal inspiratory pressure, spirometry) at either postâ€intervention or followâ€up. No adverse effects were observed in the singing group; adverse events for the control group were not reported in the paper. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of singing on quality of life or on the respiratory parameters in people with cystic fibrosis. However, there is growing interest in nonâ€medical treatments for cystic fibrosis and researchers may wish to investigate the impact of this inexpensive therapy on respiratory function and psychosocial wellâ€being further in the future. Plain language summary The effects of singing on lung function and quality of life in children and adults with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence of the effects of using singing as an addâ€on treatment in children and adults with cystic fibrosis. Background People with cystic fibrosis are at risk of chest infections due to abnormally thick mucus in their airways. Airway clearance is therefore an important part of managing the condition. Increasing anecdotal reports suggest that singing may support lung function and enhance quality of life in people with cystic fibrosis. We searched for trials using the standard search methods of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group, and conducted extensive searches in other relevant databases and publications. This is an update of a previously published review. Search date The evidence is current to: 07 January 2019. Study characteristics The review includes one study with 40 children with cystic fibrosis aged between seven and 17 years of age. This study compared a specially designed singing intervention with other nonâ€physical leisure activities (recreation) and children were selected for the singing or the recreation program randomly. The study lasted two weeks and children were followed up for between six and eight weeks. The study assessed the impact of singing on respiratory muscle strength, quality of life and lung function tests. Key results Participants from both the singing and recreation groups reported some improvement in quality of life measurements. Participants in the singing group showed a greater increase in maximal expiratory pressure (a substitute measure of respiratory muscle strength test), while there was no improvement in this outcome for those in the recreation group. No adverse events were reported. There is currently not enough evidence to assess the effect of singing on clinical outcomes in people with cystic fibrosis. Future studies using robust methods are needed to assess the possible effects of singing for people with cystic fibrosis Quality of the evidence The included study was limited by the small number of participants (only 51 participants enrolled and only 40 were analysed) and a high dropâ€out rate (21%). We also think the fact that the young people who were enrolled in the study were keen to sing, could have affected the study results.",7,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,Adolescent; Adult; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*therapy]; Humans; Music Therapy [*methods]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic,10.1002/14651858.CD008036.pub5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008036.pub5,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,42.0
CD001505.PUB5,"Lands, LC; Stanojevic, S",Oral nonâ€steroidal antiâ€inflammatory drug therapy for lung disease in cystic fibrosis,2019,"Abstract - Background Progressive lung damage causes most deaths in cystic fibrosis. Nonâ€steroidal antiâ€inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen) may prevent progressive pulmonary deterioration and morbidity in cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of treatment with oral nonâ€steroidal antiâ€inflammatory drugs in cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, hand searches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We contacted manufacturers of nonâ€steroidal antiâ€inflammatory drugs and searched online trials registries. Latest search of the Group's Trials Register: 21 November 2018. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials comparing oral nonâ€steroidal antiâ€inflammatory drugs, at any dose for at least two months, to placebo in people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion the review and their potential risk of bias. Two authors independently rated the quality of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE guidelines. Main results The searches identified 17 trials; four are included (287 participants aged five to 39 years; maximum followâ€up of four years) and one is currently awaiting classification pending publication of the full trial report and two are ongoing. Three trials compared ibuprofen to placebo (two from the same center with some of the same participants); one trial assessed piroxicam versus placebo. The three ibuprofen trials were deemed to have good or adequate methodological quality, but used various outcomes and summary measures. Reviewers considered measures of lung function, nutritional status, radiological assessment of pulmonary involvement, intravenous antibiotic usage, hospital admissions, survival and adverse effects. Combined data from the two largest ibuprofen trials showed a lower annual rate of decline for lung function, % predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ), mean difference (MD) 1.32 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 2.42) (moderateâ€quality evidence); forced vital capacity (FVC), MD 1.27 (95% CI 0.26 to 2.28) (moderateâ€quality evidence); forced expiratory flow (FEF 25%â€75% ), MD 1.80 (95% CI 0.15 to 3.45). The post hoc analysis of data from two trials split by age showed a slower rate of annual decline of FEV 1  % predicted and FVC in the ibuprofen group in younger children, MD 1.41% (95% CI 0.03 to 2.80) (moderateâ€quality evidence) and MD 1.32% (95% CI 0.04 to 2.60) (moderateâ€quality evidence) respectively. Data from four trials demonstrated the proportion of participants with at least one hospitalization may be slightly lower in the ibuprofen group compared to placebo, Peto odds ratio 0.61 (95% CI 0.37 to 1.01) (moderateâ€quality evidence). In one trial, longâ€term use of highâ€dose ibuprofen was associated with reduced intravenous antibiotic usage, improved nutritional and radiological pulmonary status. No major adverse effects were reported, but the power of the trials to identify clinically important differences in the incidence of adverse effects was low. We did not have any concerns with regards to risk of bias for the trial comparing piroxicam to placebo. However, the trial did not report many data in a form that we could analyze in this review. No data were available for the review's primary outcome of lung function; available data for hospital admissions showed no difference between the groups. No analyzable data were available for any other review outcome. Authors' conclusions Highâ€dose ibuprofen can slow the progression of lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis, especially in children, which suggests that strategies to modulate lung inflammation can be beneficial for people with cystic fibrosis. Plain language summary Treatment with oral drugs other than steroids to reduce lung inflammation and deterioration in lung function in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed evidence to see if drugs that were not steroids could reduce inflammation in the lungs and stop lung function getting worse in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Inflammation in the lungs increases the damage done to them and is the most common reason for early death in people with cystic fibrosis. In high doses, nonâ€steroidal antiâ€inflammatory drugs, particularly ibuprofen, may work against inflammation, but in low doses there is some evidence that they may cause the inflammation. The use of high doses has also raised concerns about the potential for unwanted effects, which has limited the use of these drugs in cystic fibrosis. Search date The evidence is current to: 21 November 2018. Study characteristics We looked for trials comparing oral nonâ€steroidal antiâ€inflammatory drugs to a a placebo (a tablet that contained no active medicine). We looked for any dose level. but the trial had to run for at least two months in people with cystic fibrosis. We found 17 trials and included four of these with a total of 287 people aged five to 39 years; one further trial has not yet been published in full and two are still ongoing; we will assess these when we have more information. Three of the four included trials compared ibuprofen to a placebo; two of these trials were run in the same center and used some of the same people. One trial compared a drug called piroxicam to placebo. The longest trial lasted four years. We aimed to report on lung function, nutritional status, lung xâ€rays, how often intravenous antibiotics were needed, details about hospital admissions, survival and side effects. Key results We combined results from the two largest ibuprofen trials and showed that those taking ibuprofen had a lower annual rate of decline in lung function which was consistent across three lung function measurements. We then looked at these results split by age (even though we did not originally plan to do this) and found that two of the measurements showed a slower rate of annual decline in lung function in younger children. Results from four trials showed that fewer participants in the ibuprofen group were admitted to hospital at least once compared to placebo, although it was not clear if the difference was just chance or not. In one trial, people taking a longâ€term high dose of ibuprofen were less likely to need intravenous antibiotics, had better nutritional status and healthier lungs as seen by Xâ€ray. No major side effects were reported in the trials, but they had not been designed to show differences in the rates of side effects. To summarize, we found evidence showing that a high dose of a nonâ€steroidal antiâ€inflammatory drug, most notably ibuprofen, may slow the progression of lung damage in people with cystic fibrosis, especially in younger people. The longâ€term safety results are limited but we feel that there is enough evidence to suggest that nonâ€steroidal antiâ€inflammatory drugs be temporarily stopped when people with cystic fibrosis are receiving intravenous aminoglycosides or other drugs that may badly damage the kidneys. The trial of the drug piroxicam did not report many results in a form that we could analyse in the review. We did not have any results for our main outcome of lung function. The only results we had reported no difference between the piroxicam group and the placebo group for the number of hospital admissions. Quality of the evidence We judged the evidence to be of moderate quality overall. We thought the three ibuprofen trials had a good or adequate level of methodological quality with little risk of bias to the results, but used a range of different outcomes and summary measures. We did not have any concerns with regards to risks of bias for the trial comparing piroxicam to placebo.",9,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Administration, Oral; Adolescent; Adult; Antiâ€Inflammatory Agents, Nonâ€Steroidal [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*drug therapy]; Female; Humans; Ibuprofen [administration & dosage, therapeutic use]; Male; Piroxicam [administration & dosage, therapeutic use]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Young Adult",10.1002/14651858.CD001505.pub5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001505.pub5,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,162.0
CD006682.PUB6,"Abbott, L; Plummer, A; Hoo, ZH; Wildman, M",Duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy in people with cystic fibrosis,2019,"Abstract - Background Progressive lung damage from recurrent exacerbations is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in cystic fibrosis. Life expectancy of people with cystic fibrosis has increased dramatically in the last 40 years. One of the major reasons for this increase is the mounting use of antibiotics to treat chest exacerbations caused by bacterial infections. The optimal duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy is not clearly defined. Individuals usually receive intravenous antibiotics for 14 days, but treatment may range from 10 to 21 days. A shorter duration of antibiotic treatment risks inadequate clearance of infection which could lead to further lung damage. Prolonged courses of intravenous antibiotics are expensive and inconvenient. The risk of systemic side effects such as allergic reactions to antibiotics also increases with prolonged courses and the use of aminoglycosides requires frequent monitoring to minimise some of their side effects. However, some organisms which infect people with cystic fibrosis are known to be multiâ€resistant to antibiotics, and may require a longer course of treatment. This is an update of previously published reviews. Objectives To assess the optimal duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy for treating chest exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals, abstract books and conference proceedings. Most recent search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 30 May 2019. We also searched online trials registries. Most recent search of the ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) portal: 06 January 2019. Selection criteria Randomised and quasiâ€randomised controlled trials comparing different durations of intravenous antibiotic courses for acute respiratory exacerbations in people with CF, either with the same drugs at the same dosage, the same drugs at a different dosage or frequency or different antibiotics altogether, including studies with additional therapeutic agents. Data collection and analysis No eligible trials were identified for inclusion. A trial looking at the standardised treatment of pulmonary exacerbations is currently ongoing and will be included when the results are published.  Main results No eligible trials were included. Authors' conclusions There are no clear guidelines on the optimum duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment. Duration of treatment is currently based on unit policies and response to treatment. Shorter duration of treatment should improve quality of life and adherence, result in a reduced incidence of drug reactions and be less costly. However, the shorter duration may not be sufficient to clear a chest infection and may result in an early recurrence of an exacerbation. This systematic review identifies the need for a multicentre, randomised controlled trial comparing different durations of intravenous antibiotic treatment as it has important clinical and financial implications. The currently ongoing STOP2 trial is expected to provide some guidance on these questions when published. Plain language summary Length of time needed for antibiotic treatment given directly into the blood stream to clear acute chest infections in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about how long intravenous antibiotic treatment (antibiotics given directly into the blood stream) is needed to clear flare ups of chest symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Flare ups of symptoms (exacerbations) in people with cystic fibrosis are treated aggressively to prevent further damage to the lungs. This practice has led to better survival rates for people with cystic fibrosis in recent years. However, there are no clear guidelines on how long treatment with intravenous antibiotics should be to treat these flare ups. Different centres tend to use different treatment regimens. Most centres use 10 or 14 days, extending this to 21 days if there is no improvement in a person's symptoms. This is an update of previously published reviews. Search date The evidence is current to: 30 May 2019. Study characteristics No completed studies have compared different lengths of treatment with intravenous antibiotics, but there is one study under way looking at this question. When the results are published, we plan to include the study in this review. Key results Further research is needed to find the best duration of treatment for exacerbations. A shorter duration of treatment may be better as these courses of treatment are easier for people to complete. They are also less expensive and cause fewer drug reactions than longer treatments. However, it is not clear if shorter treatment is enough to treat infections adequately. It is also not clear whether shorter treatment results in early recurrence or increased frequency of chest infections.",9,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Antiâ€Bacterial Agents [*therapeutic use]; Bacterial Infections [*drug therapy, etiology]; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications, drug therapy]; Humans; Injections, Intravenous; Quality of Life; Respiratory Tract Infections [*drug therapy, etiology]",10.1002/14651858.CD006682.pub6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006682.pub6,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,64.0
CD011231.PUB2,"Wilson, LM; Morrison, L; Robinson, KA",Airway clearance techniques for cystic fibrosis: an overview of Cochrane systematic reviews,2019,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis is a lifeâ€limiting genetic condition in which thick mucus builds up in the lungs, leading to infections, inflammation, and eventually, deterioration in lung function. To clear their lungs of mucus, people with cystic fibrosis perform airway clearance techniques daily. There are various airway clearance techniques, which differ in terms of the need for assistance or equipment, and cost. Objectives To summarise the evidence from Cochrane Reviews on the effectiveness and safety of various airway clearance techniques in people with cystic fibrosis. Methods For this overview, we included Cochrane Reviews of randomised or quasiâ€randomised controlled trials (including crossâ€over trials) that evaluated an airway clearance technique (conventional chest physiotherapy, positive expiratory pressure (PEP) therapy, highâ€pressure PEP therapy, active cycle of breathing techniques, autogenic drainage, airway oscillating devices, external high frequency chest compression devices and exercise) in people with cystic fibrosis. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews on 29 November 2018. Two review authors independently evaluated reviews for eligibility. One review author extracted data from included reviews and a second author checked the data for accuracy. Two review authors independently graded the quality of reviews using the ROBIS tool. We used the GRADE approach for assessing the overall strength of the evidence for each primary outcome (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ), individual preference and quality of life). Main results We included six Cochrane Reviews, one of which compared any type of chest physiotherapy with no chest physiotherapy or coughing alone and the remaining five reviews included headâ€toâ€head comparisons of different airway clearance techniques. All the reviews were considered to have a low risk of bias. However, the individual trials included in the reviews often did not report sufficient information to adequately assess risk of bias. Many trials did not sufficiently report on outcome measures and had a high risk of reporting bias. We are unable to draw definitive conclusions for comparisons of airway clearance techniques in terms of FEV 1 , except for reporting no difference between PEP therapy and oscillating devices after six months of treatment, mean difference â€1.43% predicted (95% confidence interval â€5.72 to 2.87); the quality of the body of evidence was graded as moderate. The quality of the body of evidence comparing different airway clearance techniques for other outcomes was either low or very low. Authors' conclusions There is little evidence to support the use of one airway clearance technique over another. People with cystic fibrosis should choose the airway clearance technique that best meets their needs, after considering comfort, convenience, flexibility, practicality, cost, or some other factor. More longâ€term, highâ€quality randomised controlled trials comparing airway clearance techniques among people with cystic fibrosis are needed. Plain language summary Airway clearance techniques for cystic fibrosis: an overview of Cochrane Reviews We reviewed the evidence from Cochrane Reviews about the effect of airway clearance techniques in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Cystic fibrosis is a lifeâ€limiting genetic condition that affects the respiratory and digestive systems. People with cystic fibrosis produce thick mucus that builds up in the lungs leading to infections and inflammation and eventually to a deterioration in lung function. People with cystic fibrosis perform airway clearance techniques at least daily to help keep their lungs clear of mucus. There are various airway clearance techniques, which differ in terms of the need for assistance or equipment, and cost. The airway clearance techniques included in this overview are conventional chest physiotherapy, various breathing techniques (active cycle of breathing technique, autogenic drainage), devices that create a positive pressure (positive expiratory pressure therapy (PEP) or highâ€pressure PEP therapy) or a vibration (oscillating devices) to move mucus, and exercise. The condition is progressive and as lung function worsens, airway clearance techniques may not be sufficient. It may be useful to consider other therapies, such as hypertonic saline or dornase alfa, in addition to airway clearance techniques. These additional therapies are not covered in this overview. Search date The evidence is current to: 29 November 2018. Study characteristics This overview included six Cochrane Reviews. One review compared any type of chest physiotherapy (conventional chest physiotherapy, PEP therapy, highâ€pressure PEP therapy, active cycle of breathing technique, autogenic drainage, exercise, vibrating (oscillating) devices) with no chest physiotherapy or coughing alone. The remaining five reviews included headâ€toâ€head comparisons of different airway clearance techniques, thus these five reviews often overlapped with each other. Key results In this overview, we found moderate evidence that PEP therapy and vibrating (oscillating) devices have a similar effect on lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) after six months of treatment. We are unable to draw definitive conclusions for all other comparisons in terms of FEV 1  because the quality of evidence is currently lacking. Likewise, we are unable to draw any definitive conclusions for other outcome measures such as individual preference and quality of life. Harms, such as acid reflux, collapsed lungs, coughing up blood, or decreased oxygen, were rarely mentioned in the original trials. There is a lack of evidence to determine if any particular airway clearance therapy is riskier than the other therapies. Quality of the evidence All of the reviews were considered to be wellâ€conducted. However, the individual trials included in the reviews often did not report enough detailed information to allow us to properly determine trial quality. Many trials did not report enough information on outcome measures; it is unclear how this missing information would influence the results. We graded the evidence for lung function when PEP was compared to vibrating (oscillating) devices as moderate, but the evidence comparing different airway clearance techniques for other outcomes, such as individual preference and quality of life was of low or very low quality. More longâ€term, highâ€quality trials (where participants are put into groups at random) which compare different airway clearance techniques among people with CF are needed.",1,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Systematic Reviews as Topic; Chest Wall Oscillation [instrumentation, methods]; Cystic Fibrosis [*therapy]; Drainage [methods]; Humans; Positiveâ€Pressure Respiration [*methods]; Respiratory Therapy [*methods]",10.1002/14651858.CD011231.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011231.pub2,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,61.0
CD012300.PUB2,"Palser, S; Smith, S; Nash, EF; Agarwal, A; Smyth, AR",Treatments for preventing recurrence of infection with   Pseudomonas aeruginosa in people with cystic fibrosis,2019,"Abstract - Background Chronic infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  (PA) in cystic fibrosis (CF) is a source of much morbidity and mortality. Eradication of early PA infection is possible, but can recur in many individuals. We sought to examine strategies to delay the time to PA recurrence in people with CF. Objectives To establish whether secondary prevention strategies, using antibiotics or other therapies, increase the chances of people with CF remaining free from PA infection following successful eradication therapy. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched ongoing trials registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 21 August 2019. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (and quasiâ€randomised trials where the risk of bias was low) comparing any treatment modality aimed at preventing recurrence of PA infection with placebo, standard therapy or any other treatment modality in people with CF who have undergone successful eradication of PA. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias. Quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Conflicts were resolved by discussion and the opinion of a third review author was sought where necessary. Only a subset of participants in the included trial were eligible, therefore individual participant data were requested and obtained from the trial investigators. Main results We included one trial (n = 306) in the review; however, only 253 participants had undergone successful eradication of PA, so fulfilling the inclusion criteria for our review. Information presented relates only to the included subset of participants. The trial recruited children aged one to 12 years (mean (standard deviation (SD)) age of 5.8 (3.5) years), 129 participants (51.0%) were female and the median followâ€up was 494 days. We compared cycled therapy with tobramycin inhalation solution (TIS), in which participants underwent 28 days of TIS every three months, with cultureâ€based therapy, in which participants were only prescribed medication when a quarterly sputum sample was positive for PA. Reasons for downgrading the quality of the evidence included applicability (only included children), incomplete outcome data and a small number of participants. The time to next isolation of PA was probably shorter with cycled TIS therapy than with cultureâ€based therapy, hazard ratio (HR) 2.04 days (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 3.26) (moderateâ€quality evidence). This is in contrast to the main publication of the only included trial, which examined rate of PA positivity rather than time to PA infection and included participants not eligible for inclusion in this review. At the end of the trial, there was no difference between the cycled and cultureâ€based groups in the change from baseline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) L, mean difference (MD) 0.0 L (95% CI â€0.09 to 0.09) or in FEV 1  % predicted, MD 0.70% (95% CI â€4.33 to 5.73) (both very lowâ€quality evidence). There was no difference in the change from baseline for FVC between the groups. There was also no difference in the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations between groups, MD â€0.18 (95% CI â€0.51 to 0.14) (moderateâ€quality evidence). Similarly, there was no difference between groups in the risk of participants developing novel resistant bacteria, RR 1.00 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.5) (moderateâ€quality evidence). There were more severe adverse events in the cycled group, but the type of treatment probably makes little or no difference to the results, RR 0.65 (95% CI 0.39 to 1.11) (moderateâ€quality evidence). There was no difference between groups in the change in weight or height from baseline or in rates of adherence to tobramycin or all trial medicines. The included trial did not assess changes in quality of life, the time to chronic infection with PA or the costâ€effectiveness of treatment. Authors' conclusions Cycled TIS therapy may be beneficial in prolonging the time to recurrence of PA after successful eradication, but further trials are required, specifically addressing this question and in both adults and children. Plain language summary Treatments for preventing recurrence of infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed evidence about the effect of treatments given to people with cystic fibrosis (CF) to prevent recurrence of infection with bacteria called  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  (PA) after it has been successfully treated. Background People with CF experience frequent, severe chest infections. These infections may be caused by bacteria that do not cause disease in healthy people, such as PA. PA is an important infection in CF since if it is not treated early it cannot be cleared from the lungs (termed chronic PA). When it cannot be cleared from the lungs, it causes ongoing damage to the lung tissue as well as worse chest infections. People with CF who have chronic PA may be more unwell than those without it. Early treatment can remove PA from the lungs of people with CF, but infection can happen again and is difficult to prevent. We want to know if giving extra treatment after the PA has been successfully treated, can prolong the time to the next infection. The treatment could be antibiotics or another treatment, for example something that helps the person's immune system fight the PA. Search date The evidence is current to: 21 August 2019. Trial characteristics We included one trial with 306 participants. Only 253 of these people had had successful treatment of PA and so could be included in our review. There were only children in the trial who were aged between one and 12 years old; 51% were girls. The trial compared treatment with one month of an inhaled antibiotic every three months ('cycled treatment') with antibiotic treatment given only when the person was found to have PA ('cultureâ€based treatment'). People were selected randomly to have either cycled or cultureâ€based treatment. The trial followed people up for an average of 70 weeks. Key results Taking into the account the certainty of the evidence, we believe that the time to the next isolation of PA was probably shorter with cycled therapy than with cultureâ€based therapy. We found that PA recurred in a quarter of participants in the cultureâ€based group by 249 days but in the cycled group it took 505 days; giving cycled treatment doubled the time to a new infection with PA compared with cultureâ€based treatment. This is in contrast to the main publication of the only included trial, which looked at the rate of positive PA cultures rather than the time to a new infection of PA and included participants not eligible for inclusion in this review. There was no difference between the groups in: pulmonary function (a measure of how well someone's lungs are working); in the number of people having chest infections; in the change in height and weight from the beginning to th end of the trial; in how many people took all the doses of the medications; in how many people developed infections with new bacteria; or in how many people had a serious complication. The trial did not give information about the effect of the two treatments on individuals' quality of life, the time until the development of chronic PA or the costâ€effectiveness of the treatment. Quality of the evidence The quality of most of the evidence was moderate. As the trial only included children, we cannot be sure if the cycled treatment would have the same effect in teenagers or adults with CF. Further trials including both adults and children are needed to help answer the question. Trials designed to specifically answer this question are needed.",12,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Administration, Inhalation; Antiâ€Bacterial Agents [*therapeutic use]; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Pseudomonas Infections [*complications, drug therapy, *prevention & control]; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Recurrence; Secondary Prevention; Tobramycin [therapeutic use]",10.1002/14651858.CD012300.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012300.pub2,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,14.0
CD007020.PUB4,"Ciofu, O; Smith, S; Lykkesfeldt, J",Antioxidant supplementation for lung disease in cystic fibrosis,2019,"Abstract - Background Airway infection leads to progressive damage of the lungs in cystic fibrosis (CF) and oxidative stress has been implicated in the etiology. Supplementation of antioxidant micronutrients (vitamin E, vitamin C, betaâ€carotene and selenium) or Nâ€acetylcysteine (NAC) as a source of glutathione, may therefore potentially help maintain an oxidantâ€antioxidant balance. Glutathione or NAC can also be inhaled and if administered in this way can also have a mucolytic effect besides the antioxidant effect. Current literature suggests a relationship between oxidative status and lung function. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To synthesise existing knowledge on the effect of antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E, betaâ€carotene, selenium and glutathione (or NAC as precursor of glutathione) on lung function through inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in people with CF. Search methods The Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register and PubMed were searched using detailed search strategies. We contacted authors of included studies and checked reference lists of these studies for additional, potentially relevant studies. We also searched online trials registries. Last search of Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 08 January 2019. Selection criteria Randomised and quasiâ€randomised controlled studies comparing antioxidants as listed above (individually or in combination) in more than a single administration to placebo or standard care in people with CF. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. We contacted study investigators to obtain missing information. If metaâ€analysed, studies were subgrouped according to supplement, method of administration and the duration of supplementation. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. Main results One quasiâ€randomised and 19 randomised controlled studies (924 children and adults) were included; 16 studies (n = 639) analysed oral antioxidant supplementation and four analysed inhaled supplements (n = 285). Only one of the 20 included studies was judged to be free of bias. Oral supplements versus control The change from baseline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) % predicted at three months and six months was only reported for the comparison of NAC to control. Four studies (125 participants) reported at three months; we are uncertain whether NAC improved FEV 1  % predicted as the quality of the evidence was very low, mean difference (MD) 2.83% (95% confidence interval (CI) â€2.16 to 7.83). However, at six months two studies (109 participants) showed that NAC probably increased FEV 1  % predicted from baseline (moderateâ€quality evidence), MD 4.38% (95% CI 0.89 to 7.87). A study of a combined vitamin and selenium supplement (46 participants) reported a greater change from baseline in FEV 1  % predicted in the control group at two months, MD â€4.30% (95% CI â€5.64 to â€2.96). One study (61 participants) found that NAC probably makes little or no difference in the change from baseline in quality of life (QoL) at six months (moderateâ€quality evidence), standardised mean difference (SMD) â€0.03 (95% CI â€0.53 to 0.47), but the twoâ€month combined vitamin and selenium study reported a small difference in QoL in favour of the control group, SMD â€0.66 (95% CI â€1.26 to â€0.07). The NAC study reported on the change from baseline in body mass index (BMI) (62 participants) and similarly found that NAC probably made no difference between groups (moderateâ€quality evidence). One study (69 participants) found that a mixed vitamin and mineral supplement may lead to a slightly lower risk of pulmonary exacerbation at six months than a multivitamin supplement (lowâ€quality evidence). Nine studies (366 participants) provided information on adverse events, but did not find any clear and consistent evidence of differences between treatment or control groups with the quality of the evidence ranging from low to moderate. Studies of Î²â€carotene and vitamin E consistently reported greater plasma levels of the respective antioxidants. Inhaled supplements versus control Two studies (258 participants) showed inhaled glutathione probably improves FEV 1  % predicted at three months, MD 3.50% (95% CI 1.38 to 5.62), but not at six months compared to placebo, MD 2.30% (95% CI â€0.12 to 4.71) (moderateâ€quality evidence). The same studies additionally reported an improvement in FEV 1  L in the treated group compared to placebo at both three and six months. One study (153 participants) reported inhaled glutathione probably made little or no difference to the change in QoL from baseline, MD 0.80 (95% CI â€1.63 to 3.23) (moderateâ€quality evidence). No study reported on the change from baseline in BMI at six months, but one study (16 participants) reported at two months and a further study (105 participants) at 12 months; neither study found any difference at either time point. One study (153 participants) reported no difference in the time to the first pulmonary exacerbation at six months. Two studies (223 participants) reported treatment may make little or no difference in adverse events (lowâ€quality evidence), a further study (153 participants) reported that the number of serious adverse events were similar across groups. Authors' conclusions With regards to micronutrients, there does not appear to be a positive treatment effect of antioxidant micronutrients on clinical endâ€points; however, oral supplementation with glutathione showed some benefit to lung function and nutritional status. Based on the available evidence, inhaled and oral glutathione appear to improve lung function, while oral administration decreases oxidative stress; however, due to the very intensive antibiotic treatment and other concurrent treatments that people with CF take, the beneficial effect of antioxidants remains difficult to assess in those with chronic infection without a very large population sample and a longâ€term study period. Further studies, especially in very young children, using outcome measures such as lung clearance index and the bronchiectasis scores derived from chest scans, with improved focus on study design variables (such as dose levels and timing), and elucidating clear biological pathways by which oxidative stress is involved in CF, are necessary before a firm conclusion regarding effects of antioxidants supplementation can be drawn. The benefit of antioxidants in people with CF who receive CFTR modulators therapies should also be assessed in the future. Plain language summary How do vitamins E and C, betaâ€carotene, selenium and glutathione affect lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis? Background Frequent chest infections cause longâ€term lung inflammation; inflammationâ€causing cells produce an oxygen molecule (reactive oxygen species (ROS)), which may harm body tissue (oxidative damage); the body uses antioxidants to protect itself. People with cystic fibrosis (CF) have high levels of ROS compared to low levels of antioxidants. Antioxidant supplements might reduce oxidative damage and build up levels of antioxidants. Given difficulties in absorbing fat, people with CF have low levels of fatâ€soluble antioxidants (vitamin E and betaâ€carotene). Waterâ€soluble vitamin C decreases with age in people with CF. Glutathione, one of the most abundant antioxidants in cells, is not released properly into the lungs of people with CF. Some enzymes that help antioxidants work depend on the mineral selenium, so selenium supplements aim to stimulate antioxidant action. Most supplements are swallowed, but glutathione and Nâ€acetylcysteine (NAC) (which the body uses to make glutathione) can also be inhaled; these may affect lung function as antioxidants, but also due to thinning mucus when inhaled (allowing easier mucus clearance). Search date Last search for this updated review: 08 January 2019. Study characteristics We included 20 studies (924 people with CF, almost equal gender split, aged six months to 59 years); 16 studies compared oral supplements to placebo ('dummy' treatment) and four compared inhaled supplements to placebo. Key results Oral supplements We are uncertain whether NAC changes lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) % predicted) at three months (four studies, 125 participants, very lowâ€quality evidence), but at six months two studies (109 participants) reported NAC probably improved FEV 1  % predicted (moderateâ€quality evidence). One study (46 participants) reported a greater change in FEV 1  % predicted with placebo than with a combined vitamin and selenium supplement after two months. One study (61 participants) reported little or no difference in quality of life (QoL) scores between NAC and control after six months (moderateâ€quality evidence), but the twoâ€month combined vitamin and selenium study reported slightly better QoL scores in the control group. NAC probably made no difference to body mass index (BMI) (one study, 62 participants, moderateâ€quality evidence). One study (69 participants) reported that a mixed vitamin and mineral supplement may lead to a lower risk of pulmonary exacerbation at six months than a multivitamin supplement (lowâ€quality evidence). Nine studies (366 participants) did not find any clear and consistent differences in side effects between groups (evidence ranged from low to moderate quality). Vitamin E and Î²â€carotene studies consistently reported greater levels of these antioxidants in blood samples. Inhaled supplements In two studies (258 participants), inhaled glutathione probably improved FEV 1  % predicted compared to placebo at three months but not at six months (moderateâ€quality evidence); these studies also reported a greater improvement in FEV 1  litres with glutathione compared to placebo at both time points. Two studies (258 participants) found little or no difference in the change in QoL scores (moderateâ€quality evidence). One twoâ€month study (16 participants) and a 12â€month study (105 participants) reported no difference between groups in the change in BMI. There was no difference in the time to the first pulmonary exacerbation in one sixâ€month study. Two studies (223 participants) reported no difference between groups in side effects (lowâ€quality evidence) and another study (153 participants) reported that the number of serious side effects were similar across groups. Conclusions Vitamin and mineral supplements do not seem to improve clinical outcomes. Inhaled glutathione appears to improve lung function, while oral administration lowers oxidative stress, with benefits to lung function and nutritional measures. Intensive antibiotic and other concurrent treatments for people with CF and chronic infection mean it is difficult to assess the effect of antioxidants without a very large and long study. Future research should look at how antioxidants affect people with CF taking CFTR modulator therapies. Quality of the evidence Evidence ranged from very low to moderate quality. All but one study had some bias; mostly because data were not fully reported (likely to affect our results). We were also largely unsure if participants knew which treatment they received, both in advance and once the studies started (unsure how this might affect our results).",10,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Administration, Inhalation; Administration, Oral; Adult; Antioxidants [*therapeutic use]; Ascorbic Acid [therapeutic use]; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*drug therapy]; Humans; Micronutrients [*therapeutic use]; Oxidative Stress; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Selenium [therapeutic use]; Vitamin E [therapeutic use]; Vitamins [therapeutic use]",10.1002/14651858.CD007020.pub4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007020.pub4,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,98.0
CD001915.PUB6,"Balfour-Lynn, IM; Welch, K; Smith, S",Inhaled corticosteroids for cystic fibrosis,2019,"Abstract - Background The reduction of lung inflammation is one of the goals of cystic fibrosis therapy. Inhaled corticosteroids are often used in this respect to treat children and adults with cystic fibrosis. The rationale for this is their potential to reduce lung damage arising from inflammation, as well as their effect on symptomatic wheezing. It is important to establish the current level of evidence for the risks and benefits of inhaled corticosteroids, especially in the light of their known adverse effects on growth. This is an update of a previously published review; however, due to the lack of research in this area, we do not envisage undertaking any further updates. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of taking regular inhaled corticosteroids compared to not taking them in children and adults with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We requested information from pharmaceutical companies manufacturing inhaled corticosteroids and authors of identified trials. Date of most recent search of the Group's Trials Register: 19 November 2018. Selection criteria Randomised or quasiâ€randomised trials, published and unpublished, comparing inhaled corticosteroids to placebo or standard treatment in individuals with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Two independent authors assessed methodological quality and risk of bias in trials using established criteria and extracted data using standard pro formas. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE criteria. Main results The searches identified 35 citations, of which 27 (representing 13 trials) were eligible for inclusion. These 13 trials reported the use of inhaled corticosteroids in 525 people with cystic fibrosis aged between 6 and 55 years. One was a withdrawal trial in 171 individuals who were already taking inhaled corticosteroids. Methodological quality and risk of bias were difficult to assess from published information. Objective measures of airway function were reported in most trials but were often incomplete and reported at different time points. We found no difference in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) or forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted in any of the trials, although the quality of the evidence was low due to risks of bias within the included trials and low participant numbers. We are uncertain whether inhaled corticosteroids result in an improvement in exercise tolerance, bronchial hyperreactivity or exacerbations as the quality of the evidence was very low. Data from one trial suggested that inhaled corticosteroids may make little or no difference to quality of life (lowâ€quality evidence). Three trials reported adverse effects, but the quality of the evidence is low and so we are uncertain whether inhaled corticosteroids increase the risk of adverse effects. However, one study did show that growth was adversely affected by high doses of inhaled corticosteroids. Authors' conclusions Evidence from these trials is of low to very low quality and insufficient to establish whether inhaled corticosteroids are beneficial in cystic fibrosis, but withdrawal in those already taking them has been shown to be safe. There is some evidence they may cause harm in terms of growth. It has not been established whether longâ€term use is beneficial in reducing lung inflammation, which should improve survival, but it is unlikely this will be proven conclusively in a randomised controlled trial. Plain language summary Inhaled corticosteroids for cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of inhaled corticosteroids in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Repeated chest infections in people with cystic fibrosis cause inflammation and damage to the lungs which, in the long term, is the most common reason for death. Inhaled corticosteroids are often used to treat inflammation, but may cause some side effects. Some of these side effects are less serious, e.g., oral thrush, but others are more serious, such as reduced growth rate in childhood. This is an update of a previously published review and due to a lack of research in this area, we do not plan any further updates. Search date The last search for evidence was on 19 November 2018. Study characteristics In this updated review, 13 trials reported the use of inhaled corticosteroids in 525 people with cystic fibrosis. In most of the trials participants started taking steroids or placebo (treatment that appeared the same as the steroids, but did not have any active medicine in it) at the start of the trial, but one trial was a withdrawal trial (171 participants), where everyone was already taking steroids and while half of them carried on, the rest took a placebo, in effect stopping the treatment. Participants were aged between 6 and 55 years; three of the trials were in children only, four in adults only and four were mixed ages; two trials did not describe the ages of the people taking part. The lung function and severity of disease of the participants varied across trials and only two trials gave information about their genetic mutations. All trials took place in Europe. In 10 of the trials, all those taking part remained in the same group up to the end of the trial (either a treatment group or a group receiving no treatment or a placebo), but in three trials they swapped groups halfway through the trial. The trials lasted between three weeks and two years. Key results The clinical trials have not been able to prove that inhaled corticosteroids reduce inflammation in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis. We found no difference in measurements of lung function, exercise tolerance, the reaction of airways to irritation or the number of exacerbations (flare up of symptoms). Generally, it was unclear if inhaled corticosteroids increased the risk of adverse effects, but one trial did show that these drugs can slow down children's growth when used in high doses. Furthermore, results from the withdrawal trial showed that under close supervision of the cystic fibrosis team, it may be safe for people who have been taking inhaled corticosteroids for some time to stop doing so. Quality of the evidence We thought the quality of the evidence was low to very low. A lack of information meant we were often not able to judge if the way the trials were designed or run could have affected our confidence in the results. Only three trials gave details of how they made sure people taking part had equal chances of being in the treatment or placebo groups; and only five described how they made sure the people recruiting participants did not know which groups they would be going into. In most cases, we did not think that once the trials started the people taking part or their doctors knew whether they were getting steroids or placebo. However, we did have some concerns that four of the trials had not been published in journals, who would have sent the reports to experts to check for accuracy and we were not sure how this might affect our confidence in the results.",7,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Administration, Inhalation; Adolescent; Adrenal Cortex Hormones [administration & dosage, adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Adult; Anti-Inflammatory Agents [administration & dosage, adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*drug therapy]; Forced Expiratory Volume [drug effects]; Humans; Middle Aged; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Vital Capacity; Young Adult",10.1002/14651858.CD001915.pub6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001915.pub6,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,17.0

In order for young people to participate effectively in shared decisionâ€making they need to develop the skills of engagement with healthcare professionals and confidence in interacting with them. They also need to learn how to manage their condition and treatments on their own when they move into adulthood. Children and young people who participate in shared decisionâ€making in healthcare are likely to be more informed, feel more prepared, and experience less anxiety about the unknown. Significant improvements in cystic fibrosis (CF) survival over recent decades, due to improved therapies and better management of care, means that young people with CF are routinely transitioning to adult healthcare where increasing emphasis on selfâ€management brings greater complexity in decisionâ€making. We need to know what interventions are effective in promoting shared decisionâ€making for young people with CF. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions that promote participation in shared decisionâ€making for children and adolescents (aged between four and 18 years) with CF. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearches of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of articles and reviews addressing shared decisionâ€making. Date of most recent search: 12 March 2019. We searched PubMed, CINAHL (EBSCO), Embase (Elsevier), PsycINFO (EBSCO), WHO ICTRP, ASSIA (ProQuest), ERIC (ProQuest), ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted study authors with published relevant research in shared decisionâ€making for adults to ask if they were aware of any published or ongoing studies on the promotion of the intervention for children or adolescents (or both) with CF. Date of most recent search: 19 March 2019. Selection criteria We planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (but not crossâ€over RCTs) of interventions promoting shared decisionâ€making for children and adolescents with CF aged between four and 18 years, such as information provision, booklets, twoâ€way interaction, checking understanding (by the participant), preparation to participate in a healthcare decision, decisionâ€aids, and training interventions or educational programs. We planned to include interventions aimed at children or adolescents (or both), parents or healthcare professionals or any combination of these groups provided that the focus was aimed at promoting shared decisionâ€making for children and adolescents with CF. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently reviewed papers identified in the searches. Main results No eligible RCTs were identified for inclusion in this systematic review. Authors' conclusions We were unable to identify RCTs with evidence which would support healthcare policyâ€making and practice related to implementation of shared decisionâ€making for children and adolescents (aged between four and 18 years) with CF). We hope that having identified this gap in research, awareness will increase amongst researchers of the need to design highâ€quality shared decisionâ€making interventions for young people with CF, perhaps adapted from existing models for adults, and to test these interventions and children's preferences in RCTs. It is also important to target health professionals with evidenceâ€based education programmes on shared decisionâ€making and a need for international consensus on addressing the variability in education programmes. Plain language summary Approaches for helping children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis to take part in decisions about their healthcare Review question We reviewed the evidence on ways to help children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis to take part in decisions about their healthcare. Background Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition mainly affecting the lungs and digestive system. In the lungs there is a buildâ€up of sticky mucus making infection more likely and damaging the airways. Sticky secretions from the pancreas block the flow of digestive juices into the gut, so that food is not digested or absorbed properly. Improvements in treatments mean that people with cystic fibrosis are living longer and longâ€term management issues have become more relevant. In childhood there is a high burden of complicated treatments which then continues throughout life. Young people with cystic fibrosis need to be included in decisions about their healthcare, so that they can develop skills to manage their condition and assume responsibility for longâ€term care. In shared decisionâ€making, a child or adolescent is actively included in healthcare decisions that affect them. We know from research with children that they want to be involved in healthcare decisions at a level of their choosing with the support of their parents and healthcare provider. We wanted to find out if there were any good techniques for encouraging children and young people with cystic fibrosis to take part in decisions about their healthcare and to identify any adverse effects. This review was funded by a Cochrane Fellowship awarded to the main author. Search date The evidence is current to: 19 March 2019. Study characteristics We planned to include studies where the people taking part would be put into groups at random. We wanted to compare approaches to shared decisionâ€making for children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis aged between four and 18 years. Examples of these would be providing information, checking the young person understood and was prepared to participate in decisionâ€making about their healthcare, the use of decisionâ€aids and training or educational programs. We planned to include approaches aimed at children and adolescents, at parents or at healthcare professionals (or any combination of these) where the focus was to promote shared decisionâ€making for children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis. Key results We did not find any studies that were eligible to include in the review. We think future research should aim to test models of shared decisionâ€making for young people with cystic fibrosis, which could be developed from existing models for adults; and also work out which methods young people prefer. It is also important to train health professionals in using shared decisionâ€making and make sure that training is consistent across all countries.",5,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Cystic Fibrosis; *Decision Making; *Patient Participation; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Humans; Selfâ€Management",10.1002/14651858.CD012578.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012578.pub2,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,24.0
CD002009.PUB7,"Bhatt, J; Jahnke, N; Smyth, AR",Onceâ€daily versus multipleâ€daily dosing with intravenous aminoglycosides for cystic fibrosis,2019,"Abstract - Background People with cystic fibrosis, who are chronically colonised with the organism  Pseudomonas aeruginosa , often require multiple courses of intravenous aminoglycoside antibiotics for the management of pulmonary exacerbations. The properties of aminoglycosides suggest that they could be given in higher doses less often. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of onceâ€daily versus multipleâ€daily dosing of intravenous aminoglycoside antibiotics for the management of pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cystic Fibrosis Specialist Register held at the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's editorial base, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals and handsearching abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 31 January 2019. We also searched online trial registries. Date of latest search: 25 February 2019. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials, whether published or unpublished, in which onceâ€daily dosing of aminoglycosides has been compared with multipleâ€daily dosing in terms of efficacy or toxicity or both, in people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis The two authors independently selected the studies to be included in the review and assessed the risk of bias of each study; authors also assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE criteria. Data were independently extracted by each author. Authors of the included studies were contacted for further information. As yet unpublished data were obtained for one of the included studies. Main results We identified 15 studies for possible inclusion in the review. Five studies reporting results from a total of 354 participants (aged 5 to 50 years) were included in this review. All studies compared onceâ€daily dosing with thriceâ€daily dosing. One crossâ€over trial had 26 participants who received the firstâ€arm treatment but only 15 received the second arm. One study had a low risk of bias for all criteria assessed; the remaining included studies had a high risk of bias from blinding, but for other criteria were judged to have either an unclear or a low risk of bias. There was little or no difference between treatment groups in: forced expiratory volume in one second, mean difference (MD) 0.33 (95% confidence interval (CI) â€2.81 to 3.48, moderateâ€quality evidence); forced vital capacity, MD 0.29 (95% CI â€6.58 to 7.16, lowâ€quality evidence); % weight for height, MD â€0.82 (95% CI â€3.77 to 2.13, lowâ€quality evidence); body mass index, MD 0.00 (95% CI â€0.42 to 0.42, lowâ€quality evidence); or in the incidence of ototoxicity, relative risk 0.56 (95% CI 0.04 to 7.96, moderateâ€quality evidence). Onceâ€daily treatment in children probably improved the percentage change in creatinine, MD â€8.20 (95% CI â€15.32 to â€1.08, moderateâ€quality evidence), but showed no difference in adults, MD 3.25 (95% CI â€1.82 to 8.33, moderateâ€quality evidence). The included trials did not report antibiotic resistance patterns or quality of life. Authors' conclusions Onceâ€ and threeâ€times daily aminoglycoside antibiotics appear to be equally effective in the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis. There is evidence of less nephrotoxicity in children. Plain language summary Giving aminoglycoside antibiotics intravenously once daily compared to giving them several times per day in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We looked for evidence to show the differences between giving intravenous antibiotics once daily compared to giving them several times a day when treating flare ups of disease (pulmonary exacerbations) in people with cystic fibrosis. This is an update of an earlier review. Background Most people with cystic fibrosis develop persistent lung infections and they may receive frequent courses of intravenous antibiotics to treat pulmonary exacerbations. Giving the antibiotics just once per day rather than several doses per day reduces the cost of treatment and the time involved. Search date The evidence is current to 31 January 2019. Study characteristics This review includes five studies with a total of 354 children and adults. All the trials compared onceâ€aâ€day dosing with three timesâ€aâ€day dosing. Key results The review found that when treating people with cystic fibrosis for pulmonary exacerbations, giving the antibiotics once per day was just as good at as giving them more frequently in terms of lung function and body mass index. The review also found that giving the antibiotics once per day appeared to be less toxic to the kidneys in children. There were no differences between the different treatment schedules for other outcomes that the studies measured. While onceâ€daily treatment can be just as effective and more convenient than threeâ€times daily treatment, we recommend further studies to look at the longâ€term safety of this treatment schedule. Quality of the evidence We judged that just one of the five studies carried a low risk that any design factors might affect the outcome results. In the remaining four studies, we thought that the fact that it was obvious whether the antibiotics were given once or three times a day could affect some outcome measures (e.g. lung function). Other risk factors were unclear or at low risk of bias. We assessed the evidence for lung function, body mass index and the evidence for side effects (e.g. toxicity) to be moderate to low quality.",9,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Lung Diseases [drug therapy, microbiology]; Aminoglycosides [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]; Antiâ€Bacterial Agents [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]; Cystic Fibrosis [complications, *drug therapy]; Drug Administration Schedule; Drug Therapy, Combination [methods]; Forced Expiratory Volume [drug effects]; Humans; Injections, Intravenous; Pseudomonas Infections [drug therapy]; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Vital Capacity [drug effects]",10.1002/14651858.CD002009.pub7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002009.pub7,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,134.0
CD009841.PUB3,"Skilton, M; Krishan, A; Patel, S; Sinha, IP; Southern, KW",Potentiators (specific therapies for class III and IV mutations) for cystic fibrosis,2019,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the commonest inherited lifeâ€shortening illness in white populations, caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator protein (CFTR), which functions as a salt transporter. This mutation mainly affects the airways where excess salt absorption dehydrates the airway lining leading to impaired mucociliary clearance. Consequently, thick, sticky mucus accumulates making the airway prone to chronic infection and progressive inflammation; respiratory failure often ensues. Other complications include malnutrition, diabetes and subfertility. Increased understanding of the condition has allowed pharmaceutical companies to design mutationâ€specific therapies targeting the underlying molecular defect. CFTR potentiators target mutation classes III and IV and aim to normalise airway surface liquid and mucociliary clearance, which in turn impacts on the chronic infection and inflammation. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To evaluate the effects of CFTR potentiators on clinically important outcomes in children and adults with CF. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles, reviews and online clinical trial registries. Last search: 21 November 2018. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of parallel design comparing CFTR potentiators to placebo in people with CF. A separate review examines trials combining CFTR potentiators with other mutationâ€specific therapies. Data collection and analysis The authors independently extracted data, assessed the risk of bias in included trials and used GRADE to assess evidence quality. Trial authors were contacted for additional data. Main results We included five RCTs (447 participants with different mutations) lasting from 28 days to 48 weeks, all assessing the CFTR potentiator ivacaftor. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low, mainly due to risk of bias (incomplete outcome data and selective reporting) and imprecision of results, particularly where few individuals experienced adverse events. Trial design was generally wellâ€documented. All trials were industryâ€sponsored and supported by other nonâ€pharmaceutical funding bodies. F508del (class II) (140 participants) One 16â€week trial reported no deaths, or changes in quality of life (QoL) or lung function (either relative or absolute change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (moderateâ€quality evidence). Pulmonary exacerbations and cough were the most reported adverse events in ivacaftor and placebo groups, but there was no difference between groups (lowâ€quality evidence); there was also no difference between groups in participants interrupting or discontinuing treatment (lowâ€quality evidence). Number of days until the first exacerbation was not reported, but there was no difference between groups in how many participants developed pulmonary exacerbations. There was also no difference in weight. Sweat chloride concentration decreased, mean difference (MD) â€2.90 mmol/L (95% confidence interval (CI) â€5.60 to â€0.20). G551D (class III) (238 participants) The 28â€day phase 2 trial (19 participants) and two 48â€week phase 3 trials (adult trial (167 adults), paediatric trial (52 children)) reported no deaths. QoL scores (respiratory domain) were higher with ivacaftor in the adult trial at 24 weeks, MD 8.10 (95% CI 4.77 to 11.43) and 48 weeks, MD 8.60 (95% CI 5.27 to 11.93 (moderateâ€quality evidence). The adult trial reported a higher relative change in FEV1 with ivacaftor at 24 weeks, MD 16.90% (95% CI 13.60 to 20.20) and 48 weeks, MD 16.80% (95% CI 13.50 to 20.10); the paediatric trial reported this at 24 weeks, MD 17.4% (P < 0.0001)) (moderateâ€quality evidence). These trials demonstrated absolute improvements in FEV1 (% predicted) at 24 weeks, MD 10.80% (95% CI 8.91 to 12.69) and 48 weeks, MD 10.44% (95% CI 8.56 to 12.32). The phase 3 trials reported increased cough, odds ratio (OR) 0.57 (95% CI 0.33 to 1.00) and episodes of decreased pulmonary function, OR 0.29 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.82) in the placebo group; ivacaftor led to increased dizziness in adults, OR 10.55 (95% CI 1.32 to 84.47). There was no difference between groups in participants interrupting or discontinuing treatment (lowâ€quality evidence). Fewer participants taking ivacaftor developed serious pulmonary exacerbations; adults taking ivacaftor developed fewer exacerbations (serious or not), OR 0.54 (95% CI 0.29 to 1.01). A higher proportion of participants were exacerbationâ€free at 24 weeks with ivacaftor (moderateâ€quality evidence). Ivacaftor led to a greater absolute change from baseline in FEV1 (% predicted) at 24 weeks, MD 10.80% (95% CI 8.91 to 12.69) and 48 weeks, MD 10.44% (95% CI 8.56 to 12.32); weight also increased at 24 weeks, MD 2.37 kg (95% CI 1.68 to 3.06) and 48 weeks, MD 2.75 kg (95% CI 1.74 to 3.75). Sweat chloride concentration decreased at 24 weeks, MD â€48.98 mmol/L (95% CI â€52.07 to â€45.89) and 48 weeks, MD â€49.03 mmol/L (95% CI â€52.11 to â€45.94). R117H (class IV) (69 participants) One 24â€week trial reported no deaths. QoL scores (respiratory domain) were higher with ivacaftor at 24 weeks, MD 8.40 (95% CI 2.17 to 14.63), but no relative changes in lung function were reported (moderateâ€quality evidence). Pulmonary exacerbations and cough were the most reported adverse events in both groups, but there was no difference between groups; there was no difference between groups in participants interrupting or discontinuing treatment (lowâ€quality evidence). Number of days until the first exacerbation was not reported, but there was no difference between groups in how many participants developed pulmonary exacerbations. No changes in absolute change in FEV1 or weight were reported. Sweat chloride concentration decreased, MD â€24.00 mmol/L (CI 95% â€24.69 to â€23.31). Authors' conclusions There is no evidence supporting the use of ivacaftor in people with the F508del mutation. Both G551D phase 3 trials demonstrated a clinically relevant impact of ivacaftor on outcomes at 24 and 48 weeks in adults and children (over six years of age) with CF. The R117H trial demonstrated an improvement in the respiratory QoL score, but no improvement in respiratory function. As new mutationâ€specific therapies emerge, it is important that trials examine outcomes relevant to people with CF and their families and that adverse events are reported robustly and consistently. Postâ€market surveillance is essential and ongoing health economic evaluations are required. Plain language summary Ivacaftor (marketed as KalydecoÂ®), a new specific therapy for cystic fibrosis Review question How does ivacaftor affect clinical outcomes (survival, quality of life and lung function) in people with cystic fibrosis (CF)? Background In people with CF, airway surfaces do not have enough water because of an abnormal protein; this makes it difficult to clear thick and sticky mucus, which leads to lung infections. Ivacaftor works on the abnormal protein in people with some mutations to allow the airways retain more water and better clear mucus, so fewer lung infections develop. Ivacaftor was aimed at people with class III and IV mutations, and has been studied in people with G551D (class III), R117H (class IV) and F508del (class II) mutations. Trial characteristics We included five trials (447 participants) comparing ivacaftor to placebo (dummy treatment with no active medication) lasting between four and 48 weeks. Three trials enrolled a total of 238 people with at least one copy of the G551D mutation, one trial enrolled 140 people with two copies of the F508del mutation and one enrolled 69 people with at least one copy of the R117H mutation. The evidence is up to date as of 21 November 2018. Key results F508del mutation The trial did not report any deaths or show improvements in lung function, quality of life scores or weight. Cough and pulmonary exacerbations (flare ups of lung disease) were the most reported adverse events when taking both ivacaftor and placebo; there were a similar number of flare ups for both groups. Sweat chloride concentrations were reduced with ivacaftor. G551D mutation No deaths were reported. Both children and adults taking ivacaftor showed improvements in lung function, but only adults reported higher quality of life scores. People given placebo reported more coughing and experienced more episodes of decreased lung function; more adults taking ivacaftor reported episodes of dizziness. Similar numbers of people taking ivacaftor and placebo delayed the course of medication, or withdrew from the trial altogether, due to side effects (e.g. psychological issues, liver disease, severe breathing problems). There were more serious pulmonary exacerbations whilst taking placebo compared to ivacaftor. Adults taking ivacaftor were admitted to hospital less often and had fewer courses of intravenous antibiotics for exacerbations. Both children and adults and children increased their weight with ivacaftor. There was a drop in sweat chloride concentrations with ivacaftor. R117H mutation No deaths occurred in this trial. While quality of life scores improved with ivacaftor, lung function did not. Cough and pulmonary exacerbations (flare ups of lung disease) were the most reported adverse events when taking both ivacaftor and placebo; there were a similar number of flare ups for both groups. There was no difference in weight; but as for other mutations there was a reduction in sweat chloride concentration with ivacaftor.â€¨ â€¨ Evidence suggests that ivacaftor is an effective treatment for people (over six years of age) with cystic fibrosis and the G551D mutation, but not for those with the F508del or R117H mutations. Quality of the evidence In most trials, individuals were put into different treatment groups at random with equal chances of being given either placebo or ivacaftor; no one could work out which treatment the next person would receive, so that healthier people did not receive ivacaftor and make the results seem better. We were not sure whether anyone involved in the trial knew who was receiving which treatment and how this might affect results. No trials reported all results clearly; sometimes they did not report them in a way that we could use in the review and sometimes they did not report the data at all. This affected our certainty regarding the overall results. Information about some side effects was limited as not many people experienced them, therefore, it is difficult to judge whether there was a difference between treatment groups We judged the evidence in this review to be moderate to low quality.

CD003147.PUB5,"McIlwaine, M; Button, B; Nevitt, SJ",Positive expiratory pressure physiotherapy for airway clearance in people with cystic fibrosis,2019,"Abstract - Background Chest physiotherapy is widely prescribed to assist the clearance of airway secretions in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Positive expiratory pressure (PEP) devices provide back pressure to the airways during expiration. This may improve clearance by building up gas behind mucus via collateral ventilation and by temporarily increasing functional residual capacity. The developers of the PEP technique recommend using PEP with a mask in order to avoid air leaks via the upper airways and mouth. In addition, increasing forced residual capacity (FRC) has not been demonstrated using mouthpiece PEP. Given the widespread use of PEP devices, there is a need to determine the evidence for their effect. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and acceptability of PEP devices compared to other forms of physiotherapy as a means of improving mucus clearance and other outcomes in people with CF. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. The electronic database CINAHL was also searched from 1982 to 2017. Most recent search of the Group's CF Trials Register: 20 February 2019. Selection criteria Randomised controlled studies in which PEP was compared with any other form of physiotherapy in people with CF. This included, postural drainage and percussion (PDPV), active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT), oscillating PEP devices, thoracic oscillating devices, bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPaP) and exercise. Data collection and analysis Three authors independently applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria to publications, assessed the risk of bias of the included studies and assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE recommendations. Main results A total of 28 studies (involving 788 children and adults) were included in the review; 18 studies involving 296 participants were crossâ€over in design. Data were not published in sufficient detail in most of these studies to perform any metaâ€analysis. In 22 of the 28 studies the PEP technique was performed using a mask, in three of the studies a mouthpiece was used with nose clips and in three studies it was unclear whether a mask or mouthpiece was used. These studies compared PEP to ACBT, autogenic drainage (AD), oral oscillating PEP devices, highâ€frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) and BiPaP and exercise. Forced expiratory volume in one second was the review's primary outcome and the most frequently reported outcome in the studies (24 studies, 716 participants). Single interventions or series of treatments that continued for up to three months demonstrated little or no difference in effect between PEP and other methods of airway clearance on this outcome (lowâ€ to moderateâ€quality evidence). However, longâ€term studies had equivocal or conflicting results regarding the effect on this outcome (lowâ€ to moderateâ€quality evidence). A second primary outcome was the number of respiratory exacerbations. There was a lower exacerbation rate in participants using PEP compared to other techniques when used with a mask for at least one year (five studies, 232 participants; moderateâ€ to highâ€quality evidence). In one of the included studies which used PEP with a mouthpiece, it was reported (personal communication) that there was no difference in the number of respiratory exacerbations (66 participants, lowâ€quality evidence). Participant preference was reported in 10 studies; and in all studies with an intervention period of at least one month, this was in favour of PEP. The results for the remaining outcome measures (including our third primary outcome of mucus clearance) were not examined or reported in sufficient detail to provide any highâ€quality evidence; only very lowâ€ to moderateâ€quality evidence was available for other outcomes. There was limited evidence reported on adverse events; these were measured in five studies, two of which found no events. In a study where infants performing either PEP or PDPV experienced some gastroâ€oesophageal reflux , this was more severe in the PDPV group (26 infants, lowâ€quality evidence). In PEP versus oscillating PEP, adverse events were only reported in the flutter group (five participants complained of dizziness, which improved after further instructions on device use was provided) (22 participants, lowâ€quality evidence). In PEP versus HFCWO, from one longâ€term highâ€quality study (107 participants) there was little or no difference in terms of number of adverse events; however, those in the PEP group had fewer adverse events related to the lower airways when compared to HFCWO (highâ€certainty evidence). Many studies had a risk of bias as they did not report how the randomisation sequence was either generated or concealed. Most studies reported the number of dropouts and also reported on all planned outcome measures. Authors' conclusions The evidence provided by this review is of variable quality, but suggests that all techniques and devices described may have a place in the clinical treatment of people with CF. Following metaâ€analyses of the effects of PEP versus other airway clearance techniques on lung function and patient preference, this Cochrane Review demonstrated that there was highâ€quality evidence that showed a significant reduction in pulmonary exacerbations when PEP using a mask was compared with HFCWO. It is important to note that airway clearance techniques should be individualised throughout life according to developmental stages, patient preferences, pulmonary symptoms and lung function. This also applies as conditions vary between baseline function and pulmonary exacerbations. Plain language summary Using positive expiratory pressure physiotherapy to clear the airways of people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence on the effect of positive expiratory pressure (PEP) physiotherapy to clear the airways of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Background CF affects approximately one in 3000 live births in white populations and causes frequent lung infection, due to mucus blocking the airways. Chest physiotherapy is often used to try to clear the mucus from the lungs. We wanted to discover whether using a PEP device (a form of chest physiotherapy) was better or worse than other other forms of chest physiotherapy for clearing the mucus from the lungs in people with CF. A PEP device provides positive pressure behind the mucus to try to push it out of the lungs. This is an update of a previously published review. Search date The evidence is current to 20 February 2019. Study characteristics The review includes 28 studies with 788 people (from infants to adults) with CF with mild to severe lung disease. The studies compared PEP to other methods of chest physiotherapy; the length of treatment ranged from a single session to two years of treatment. Key results Generally, the efficacy of PEP is similar to other methods of chest physiotherapy such as postural drainage with percussion, active cycle of breathing techniques, autogenic drainage, oscillatory PEP devices such as the flutter and acapella, thoracic oscillating devices such as the 'Vest', and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPaP) (typically used for ventilatory support, but by changing the inspiratory and expiratory pressures on the device and combining it with huffing, BiPaP has been used for airway clearance). We found no difference between PEP and other forms of chest physiotherapy in lung function, the amount of mucus cleared from the airways or its related effects on the health of people with CF. However, the rate of flare ups of respiratory symptoms decreased in people using PEP compared to other forms of physiotherapy such as a vibrating PEP device or a vibrating vest. There was some evidence that people with CF may prefer PEP to other chest physiotherapy methods. There was no evidence of PEP causing harm, except in one study where infants performing either PEP or percussion in various positions which use gravity to help drain secretions, experienced some gastroâ€oesophageal reflux (regurgitation of food) in headâ€down positions; this was more severe in the group using postural drainage with percussion. In all the other trials PEP was performed in a sitting position. In 10 of the 28 studies studied single PEP treatment sessions. The results from these studies are very limited as they could not report on the number of respiratory infections and lung function did not change with just one treatment. Two oneâ€year studies compared PEP to postural drainage and percussion; in the study with children, PEP improved their lung function, while in the adult study, lung function declined slightly with both PEP and postural drainage and percussion. Also, the method of performing PEP was different in the two age groups. Although PEP seems to have an advantage in reducing flare ups (based on the combined results of a few studies), different physiotherapy techniques and devices may be more or less effective at varying times and in different individuals during baseline function and chest flare ups. Each person should talk to their clinician to help choose which method of airway clearance is best for them and which they will adhere to, so as to provide the best quality of life and longâ€term outcomes. Quality of the evidence Some studies were of low quality. These studies highlight the difficulty in comparing studies using PEP compared to other forms of chest physiotherapy. Factors such as age and severity of lung disease in the participants may affect the results as well as the method of performing each treatment. Overall, the evidence provided by this review for whether PEP reduces flare ups compared to other forms of chest physiotherapy was moderate to high quality, but evidence for other outcomes was of very low to moderate quality, as results were limited.",11,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Cystic Fibrosis [complications, *therapy]; Drainage, Postural [methods]; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Mucociliary Clearance; Mucus [metabolism]; Physical Therapy Modalities; Positiveâ€Pressure Respiration [*methods]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Therapy [*methods]",10.1002/14651858.CD003147.pub5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003147.pub5,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,177.0
CD009876.PUB4,"Regan, KH; Bhatt, J",Eradication therapy for   Burkholderia cepacia complex in people with cystic fibrosis,2019,"Abstract - Background Chronic infection with  Burkholderia cepacia  complex species remains a significant problem for clinicians treating people with cystic fibrosis. Colonisation with  Burkholderia cepacia  complex species is linked to a more rapid decline in lung function and increases morbidity and mortality. There remain no objective guidelines for strategies to eradicate  Burkholderia cepacia  complex in cystic fibrosis lung disease, as these are inherently resistant to the majority of antibiotics and there has been very little research in this area. This review aims to examine the current treatment options for people with cystic fibrosis with acute infection with  Burkholderia cepacia  complex and to identify an evidenceâ€based strategy that is both safe and effective. This is an updated version of the review. Objectives To identify whether treatment of  Burkholderia cepacia  complex infections can achieve eradication, or if treatment can prevent or delay the onset of chronic infection. To establish whether following eradication, clinical outcomes are improved and if there are any adverse effects. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Last search: 12 March 2019. We also searched electronic clinical trials registers for the USA and Europe. Date of last search: 12 March 2019. Selection criteria Randomised or quasiâ€randomised studies in people with cystic fibrosis of antibiotics or alternative therapeutic agents used alone or in combination, using any method of delivery and any treatment duration, to eradicate  Burkholderia cepacia  complex infections compared to another antibiotic, placebo or no treatment. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed for inclusion in the review the eligibility of 52 studies (79 references) identified by the search of the Group's Trial Register and the other electronic searches. Main results No studies looking at the eradication of  Burkholderia cepacia  complex species were identified. Authors' conclusions The authors have concluded that there was an extreme lack of evidence in this area of treatment management for people with cystic fibrosis. Without further comprehensive studies, it is difficult to draw conclusions about a safe and effective management strategy for  Burkholderia cepacia  complex eradication in cystic fibrosis. Thus, while the review could not offer clinicians evidence of an effective eradication protocol for  Burkholderia cepacia  complex, it has highlighted an urgent need for exploration and research in this area, specifically the need for wellâ€designed multiâ€centre randomised controlled studies of a variety of (novel) antibiotic agents. Plain language summary Treatments to cure longâ€term infections with  Burkholderia cepacia  in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence for antibiotic treatment to cure early infection with  Burkholderia cepacia  complex in people with cystic fibrosis and prevent it becoming permanent. Background Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease and people who have this disease produce large amounts of thick mucus which is difficult to clear. This mucus blocks up their lungs and digestive systems. People with cystic fibrosis suffer from lots of chest infections, which cause scarring of their airways. Eventually, they develop infections that can't be cured with antibiotics, so their lungs always contain lots of bugs, this is described as being chronically infected. One of these bugs,  Burkholderia cepacia , causes a lot of problems for people with cystic fibrosis because it is very difficult to treat and makes their lung disease deteriorate faster than it otherwise would. This is an updated version of the review. Search date We last searched for any evidence on 12 March 2019. Study characteristics We looked for studies of treatments which could eliminate  Burkholderia cepacia  from the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis. We did not find any relevant studies. This review highlights an urgent need for more research into new ways of treating longâ€term  Burkholderia cepacia  infection in people with cystic fibrosis.",4,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,*Burkholderia cepacia complex; Antiâ€Bacterial Agents [*therapeutic use]; Burkholderia Infections [*drug therapy]; Cystic Fibrosis [*microbiology]; Disease Eradication; Humans,10.1002/14651858.CD009876.pub4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009876.pub4,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,81.0
CD006112.PUB5,"Stanford, G; Ryan, H; Solis-Moya, A",Respiratory muscle training for cystic fibrosis,2020,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis is the most common autosomal recessive disease in white populations, and causes respiratory dysfunction in the majority of individuals. Numerous types of respiratory muscle training to improve respiratory function and healthâ€related quality of life in people with cystic fibrosis have been reported in the literature. Hence a systematic review of the literature is needed to establish the effectiveness of respiratory muscle training (either inspiratory or expiratory muscle training) on clinical outcomes in cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of respiratory muscle training on clinical outcomes in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials register comprising of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of most recent search: 11 June 2020. A hand search of the Journal of Cystic Fibrosis and Pediatric Pulmonology was performed, along with an electronic search of online trial databases. Date of most recent search: 05 October 2020. Selection criteria Randomised controlled studies comparing respiratory muscle training with a control group in people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Review authors independently selected articles for inclusion, evaluated the methodological quality of the studies, and extracted data. Additional information was sought from trial authors where necessary. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE system. Main results Authors identified 20 studies, of which 10 studies with 238 participants met the review's inclusion criteria. There was wide variation in the methodological and written quality of the included studies. Four of the 10 included studies were published as abstracts only and lacked concise details, thus limiting the information available. Eight studies were parallel studies and two of a crossâ€over design. Respiratory muscle training interventions varied dramatically, with frequency, intensity and duration ranging from thrice weekly to twice daily, 20% to 80% of maximal effort, and 10 to 30 minutes, respectively. Participant numbers ranged from 11 to 39 participants in the included studies; five studies were in adults only, one in children only and four in a combination of children and adults. No differences between treatment and control were reported in the primary outcome of pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in one second and forced vital capacity) or postural stability (very lowâ€quality evidence). Although no change was reported in exercise capacity as assessed by the maximum rate of oxygen use and distance completed in a six minute walk test, a 10% improvement in exercise duration was found when working at 60% of maximal effort in one study (n = 20) (very lowâ€quality evidence). In a further study (n = 18), when working at 80% of maximal effort, healthâ€related quality of life improved in the mastery and emotion domains (very lowâ€quality evidence). With regards to the review's secondary outcomes, one study (n = 11) found a change in intramural pressure, functional residual capacity and maximal inspiratory pressure following training (very lowâ€quality evidence). Another study (n=36) reported improvements in maximal inspiratory pressure following training (P < 0.001) (very lowâ€quality evidence). A further study (n = 22) reported that respiratory muscle endurance was longer in the training group (P < 0.01). No studies reported significant differences on any other secondary outcomes. Metaâ€analyses could not be performed due to a lack of consistency and insufficient detail in reported outcome measures. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to suggest whether this intervention is beneficial or not. Healthcare practitioners should consider the use of respiratory muscle training on a caseâ€byâ€case basis. Further research of reputable methodological quality is needed to determine the effectiveness of respiratory muscle training in people with cystic fibrosis. Researchers should consider the following clinical outcomes in future studies; respiratory muscle function, pulmonary function, exercise capacity, hospital admissions, and healthâ€related quality of life. Sensoryâ€perceptual changes, such as respiratory effort sensation (e.g. rating of perceived breathlessness) and peripheral effort sensation (e.g. rating of perceived exertion) may also help to elucidate mechanisms underpinning the effectiveness of respiratory muscle training. Plain language summary Training the muscles that cause the chest to expand and contract in people with cystic fibrosis Review question What are the effects of training muscles to influence breathing (in and out) in people with cystic fibrosis? Background Cystic fibrosis is the most common genetic disease in white populations and causes problems with the lungs in most people with the condition. Training the muscles that cause the chest to expand and contract may help to improve lung function and the quality of life for people with cystic fibrosis. Search date The evidence is current to: 11 June 2020. Study characteristics We searched for studies where people with cystic fibrosis were put into either a group for respiratory muscle training or a control group at random. We included ten studies with 238 people which used a wide variety of training methods and levels. In eight of the studies, the treatment group and the control group each only received either respiratory muscle training or a control treatment (one study had three groups in total: one receiving control treatment and two receiving different levels of training). In one study the participants received both types of treatment, but in a random order. Lastly, one study compared training with usual care. The studies lasted for a maximum of 12 weeks and all were quite small; the largest only had 39 people taking part. The studies included people with a range of ages over six years old, but most seemed to be adults. The studies reported a variety of outcomes. All reported some measure of respiratory muscle strength, and most reported at least one measure of lung function, however only three studies reported on quality of life. Key results Results could not be combined to answer the review question, because the studies either did not publish enough details or did not use the same standard measurements. No study found any difference in lung function after training, but one of the studies reported an improvement in exercise duration when training at 60% of maximal effort and a further study which trained participants at 80% of maximal effort reported some improvements in quality of life judgements. There was some evidence of an improvement in respiratory muscle function in two studies. Given this lack of information, a recommendation for or against respiratory muscle training cannot be made. Future studies should look to improve upon the methods of those previously conducted, and should report using standardised measurements. Quality of the evidence It was generally unclear how people were split into groups for treatment and whether this would have affected the results. Three studies stated that the people assessing the outcomes did not know which treatment those taking part had received, but this was unclear in other studies. Individuals dropped out of three of the studies for reasons which may be directly related to the treatment and therefore may introduce a risk of bias to the results. One study had noâ€one drop out and the other six studies did not state how many people dropped out of them. We assessed the quality of the evidence and judged the evidence for lung function, exercise capacity, postural stability and healthâ€related quality of life to be very low quality, but the evidence for respiratory muscle function to be low quality.",12,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,Adult; Breathing Exercises [*methods]; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*therapy]; Forced Expiratory Flow Rates; Humans; Inhalation [*physiology]; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Muscles [*physiology]; Vital Capacity,10.1002/14651858.CD006112.pub5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006112.pub5,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,48.0
CD008037.PUB4,"Hurley, MN; Smith, S; Forrester, DL; Smyth, AR",Antibiotic adjuvant therapy for pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis,2020,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis is a multiâ€system disease characterised by the production of thick secretions causing recurrent pulmonary infection, often with unusual bacteria. This leads to lung destruction and eventually death through respiratory failure. There are no antibiotics in development that exert a new mode of action and many of the current antibiotics are ineffective in eradicating the bacteria once chronic infection is established. Antibiotic adjuvants â€ therapies that act by rendering the organism more susceptible to attack by antibiotics or the host immune system, by rendering it less virulent or killing it by other means, would be a significant therapeutic advance. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To determine if antibiotic adjuvants improve clinical and microbiological outcome of pulmonary infection in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register which is compiled from database searches, hand searches of appropriate journals and conference proceedings. Date of most recent search: 16 January 2020. We also searched MEDLINE (all years) on 14 February 2019 and ongoing trials registers on 06 April 2020. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials and quasiâ€randomised controlled trials of a therapy exerting an antibiotic adjuvant mechanism of action compared to placebo or no therapy for people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Two of the authors independently assessed and extracted data from identified trials. Main results We identified 42 trials of which eight (350 participants) that examined antibiotic adjuvant therapies are included. Two further trials are ongoing and five are awaiting classification. The included trials assessed Î²â€carotene (one trial, 24 participants), garlic (one trial, 34 participants), KB001â€A (a monoclonal antibody) (two trials, 196 participants), nitric oxide (two trials, 30 participants) and zinc supplementation (two trials, 66 participants). The zinc trials recruited children only, whereas the remaining trials recruited both adults and children. Three trials were located in Europe, one in Asia and four in the USA. Three of the interventions measured our primary outcome of pulmonary exacerbations (Î²â€carotene, mean difference (MD) â€8.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) â€18.78 to 2.78); KB001â€A, risk ratio (RR) 0.25 (95% CI 0.03 to 2.40); zinc supplementation, RR 1.85 (95% CI 0.65 to 5.26). Î²â€carotene and KB001â€A may make little or no difference to the number of exacerbations experienced (lowâ€quality evidence); whereas, given the moderateâ€quality evidence we found that zinc probably makes no difference to this outcome. Respiratory function was measured in all of the included trials. Î²â€carotene and nitric oxide may make little or no difference to forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) (lowâ€quality evidence), whilst garlic probably makes little or no difference to FEV 1  (moderateâ€quality evidence). It is uncertain whether zinc or KB001â€A improve FEV 1  as the certainty of this evidence is very low. Few adverse events were seen across all of the different interventions and the adverse events that were reported were mild or not treatmentâ€related (quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate). One of the trials (169 participants) comparing KB001â€A and placebo, reported on the time to the next course of antibiotics; results showed there is probably no difference between groups, HR 1.00 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.45) (moderateâ€quality evidence). Quality of life was only reported in the two KB001â€A trials, which demonstrated that there may be little or no difference between KB001â€A and placebo (lowâ€quality evidence). Sputum microbiology was measured and reported for the trials of KB001â€A and nitric oxide (four trials). There was very lowâ€quality evidence of a numerical reduction in  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  density with KB001â€A, but it was not significant. The two trials looking at the effects of nitric oxide reported significant reductions in  Staphylococcus aureus  and nearâ€significant reductions in  Pseudomonas aeruginosa , but the quality of this evidence is again very low. Authors' conclusions We could not identify an antibiotic adjuvant therapy that we could recommend for treating of lung infection in people with cystic fibrosis. The emergence of increasingly resistant bacteria makes the reliance on antibiotics alone challenging for cystic fibrosis teams. There is a need to explore alternative strategies, such as the use of adjuvant therapies. Further research is required to provide future therapeutic options. Plain language summary Antibiotic enhancing treatment for lung infections in cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the use of agents to help antibiotics in treating lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis. Background People with cystic fibrosis suffer from infections in their lungs as they produce thick secretions which allow bacteria to grow in them. Often the infections are caused by unusual bacteria, including  Pseudomonas aeruginosa,  and these bacteria become resistant to treatment with antibiotics. Longâ€term infection reduces a person's quality of life and their lung function. There are no new antibiotics currently being developed which use a new type of action. New agents â€ antibiotic adjuvants â€ are needed to work alongside antibiotics to make bacteria more sensitive to either antibiotics or to the body's own immune system, and to interfere with the formation of colonies of bacteria in the lungs. Search date The evidence is current to: 16 January 2020. Trial characteristics The review includes eight trials with 350 people with cystic fibrosis aged between five and 54 years of age .  Trials compared different antibiotic adjuvants (betaâ€carotene (one trial), garlic (one trial), a biological agent (two trials), nitric oxide (two trials) and zinc (two trials)) with placebo (a substance that contains no medication) and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly. The trials lasted from two days to one year. Key results None of the treatments led to a longer time until the next flare up of lung disease compared to the people who received placebo. For the other measures we looked at (lung function, side effects, quality of life or number of infections) there were also no differences between the people given the adjuvant and the people given the placebo. All of the trials measured side effects of the treatment but these were mostly mild and happened in both the people receiving the treatment and those that did not. None of the therapies for enhancing the actions of antibiotics which we found, showed a significant benefit for either lung function, rate of infection or quality of life. More randomised controlled trials are needed before we can recommend the routine use of any of these therapies. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence ranges from very low to moderate, but we judged it to be low overall. We made these judgements because of the small number of trials that looked at each of the different adjuvant treatments meaning we were unable to combine results. The quality was also affected by the small number of people who were included.",7,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Adolescent; Adult; Anti-Bacterial Agents [*administration & dosage]; Antibodies, Monoclonal [therapeutic use]; Bacterial Infections [*drug therapy, microbiology]; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Disease Progression; Garlic; Humans; Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments [therapeutic use]; Lung Diseases [*drug therapy, microbiology]; Nitric Oxide [therapeutic use]; Pseudomonas Infections [drug therapy]; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Vitamins [therapeutic use]; Young Adult; Zinc [administration & dosage]; beta Carotene [therapeutic use]",10.1002/14651858.CD008037.pub4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008037.pub4,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,40.0
CD006842.PUB5,"Morrison, L; Milroy, S",Oscillating devices for airway clearance in people with cystic fibrosis,2020,"Abstract - Background Chest physiotherapy is widely prescribed to assist the clearance of airway secretions in people with cystic fibrosis. Oscillating devices generate intraâ€ or extraâ€thoracic oscillations orally or external to the chest wall. Internally they create variable resistances within the airways, generating controlled oscillating positive pressure which mobilises mucus. Extraâ€thoracic oscillations are generated by forces outside the respiratory system, e.g. high frequency chest wall oscillation. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To identify whether oscillatory devices, oral or chest wall, are effective for mucociliary clearance and whether they are equivalent or superior to other forms of airway clearance in the successful management of secretions in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and hand searches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Latest search of the Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 29 July 2019. In addition we searched the trials databases ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Latest search of trials databases: 15 August 2019. Selection criteria Randomised controlled studies and controlled clinical studies of oscillating devices compared with any other form of physiotherapy in people with cystic fibrosis. Singleâ€treatment interventions (therapy technique used only once in the comparison) were excluded. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently applied the inclusion criteria to publications, assessed the quality of the included studies and assessed the evidence using GRADE. Main results The searches identified 82 studies (330 references); 39 studies (total of 1114 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Studies varied in duration from up to one week to one year; 20 of the studies were crossâ€over in design. The studies also varied in type of intervention and the outcomes measured, data were not published in sufficient detail in most of these studies, so metaâ€analysis was limited. Few studies were considered to have a low risk of bias in any domain. It is not possible to blind participants and clinicians to physiotherapy interventions, but 13 studies did blind the outcome assessors. The quality of the evidence across all comparisons ranged from low to very low. Forced expiratory volume in one second was the most frequently measured outcome and while many of the studies reported an improvement in those people using a vibrating device compared to before the study, there were few differences when comparing the different devices to each other or to other airway clearance techniques. One study identified an increase in frequency of exacerbations requiring antibiotics whilst using high frequency chest wall oscillation when compared to positive expiratory pressure (lowâ€quality evidence). There were some small but significant changes in secondary outcome variables such as sputum volume or weight, but not wholly in favour of oscillating devices and due to the lowâ€ or very lowâ€quality evidence, it is not clear whether these were due to the particular intervention. Participant satisfaction was reported in 13 studies but again with lowâ€ or very lowâ€quality evidence and not consistently in favour of an oscillating device, as some participants preferred breathing techniques or techniques used prior to the study interventions. The results for the remaining outcome measures were not examined or reported in sufficient detail to provide any highâ€level evidence. Authors' conclusions There was no clear evidence that oscillation was a more or less effective intervention overall than other forms of physiotherapy; furthermore there was no evidence that one device is superior to another. The findings from one study showing an increase in frequency of exacerbations requiring antibiotics whilst using an oscillating device compared to positive expiratory pressure may have significant resource implications. More adequatelyâ€powered longâ€term randomised controlled trials are necessary and outcomes measured should include frequency of exacerbations, individual preference, adherence to therapy and general satisfaction with treatment. Increased adherence to therapy may then lead to improvements in other parameters, such as exercise tolerance and respiratory function. Additional evidence is needed to evaluate whether oscillating devices combined with other forms of airway clearance is efficacious in people with cystic fibrosis.There may also be a requirement to consider the cost implication of devices over other forms of equally advantageous airway clearance techniques. Using the GRADE method to assess the quality of the evidence, we judged this to be low or very low quality, which suggests that further research is very likely to have an impact on confidence in any estimate of effect generated by future interventions. Plain language summary The use of vibrating devices to help people with cystic fibrosis clear their airways of mucus Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of vibrating devices (e.g. Flutter, acapella, cornet, Quake Â® , intrapulmonary percussive ventilation, high frequency chest wall oscillators (e.g. Vest Â® ), VibraLung Â®,  MetaNeb Â® , and Aerobika Â®  to help people with cystic fibrosis clear their airways of mucus. This is an update of a previously published review. Background People with cystic fibrosis have too much sticky mucus in their lungs which can lead to constant infection and inflammation. This damages their airways and worsens lung function over time. People with cystic fibrosis use chest physiotherapy to clear the mucus from their lungs. They can use different methods alone or in combination with others â€ manual techniques, breathing techniques and mechanical devices. Vibrating devices (also sometimes known as oscillators) use pressure generated either inside or outside of the body to clear the mucus. Search date Evidence is current to 29 July 2019. Study characteristics The review included 39 studies with 1114 people with cystic fibrosis aged between 4 and 63 years of age .  Studies compared different physiotherapy treatments and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly. Not many studies looked at the same types of physiotherapy over the same period of time; studies ranged in duration from two days to 13 months. Key results Given the differences in study design, it was difficult to combine the results from these studies in a useful way. We did not find any clear evidence that vibrating devices were better than any other form of physiotherapy which they were compared to in these studies, or that one device was better than another. One study found that people using an vibrating device needed additional antibiotics for a chest infection more often than those using positive expiratory pressure. When recommending the most suitable method of airway clearance, physiotherapists should consider the needs of the people they are treating. For the future, larger and longer trials are needed to measure the frequency of lung infections, preference, adherence to and general satisfaction with treatment, financial constraints should also be taken into consideration. We think adherence is important, because if people with cystic fibrosis are willing to stick to their physiotherapy regimen, there may be improvements in other outcomes such as exercise tolerance, respiratory function and mortality. Quality of the evidence Overall, we thought most studies had some design problems which might affect our confidence in some of the results. In about a quarter of studies there were concerns that not all the results were reported clearly and in about a third of the studies the reasons for people withdrawing from a trial were not clearly explained. In comparisons of different types of physiotherapy, a person and their physiotherapist will always know which treatment they are receiving and this might affect their answers to some questions, such as which treatment makes them feel better, but we only thought this was a problem in a few studies. We used a scoring system called GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence, we then judged it to be either lowâ€ or very lowâ€quality, which suggests that further research is very likely to affect our confidence in the results in this review for of any of the interventions analysed.",4,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Mucociliary Clearance; Adolescent; Adult; Breathing Exercises; Chest Wall Oscillation [*instrumentation]; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications, physiopathology]; Disease Progression; Forced Expiratory Flow Rates; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Lung Diseases, Obstructive [etiology, *therapy]; Middle Aged; Mucus [*metabolism]; Patient Satisfaction; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Sputum [metabolism]; Vibration [*therapeutic use]",10.1002/14651858.CD006842.pub5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006842.pub5,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,155.0
CD009529.PUB4,"Lord, R; Jones, AM; Horsley, A",Antibiotic treatment for   Burkholderia cepacia complex in people with cystic fibrosis experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation,2020,"Abstract - Background Chronic pulmonary infection is a hallmark of lung disease in cystic fibrosis. Infections dominated by organisms of the  Burkholderia cepacia  complex, a group of at least 18 closelyâ€related species of gramâ€negative bacteria, are particularly difficult to treat. These infections may be associated with a fulminant necrotising pneumonia.  Burkholderia cepacia complex  bacteria are resistant to many common antibiotics and able to acquire resistance against many more. Following patient segregation in cystic fibrosis medical care, the more virulent epidemic strains are not as frequent, and new infections are more likely to be with less virulent environmentallyâ€acquired strains. Although evidenceâ€based guidelines exist for treating respiratory exacerbations involving  Pseudomonas aeruginosa,  these cannot be extended to  Burkholderia cepacia  complex infections. This review, which is an update of a previous review, aims to assess the available trial evidence for the choice and application of treatments for these infections. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of different antibiotic regimens in people with cystic fibrosis experiencing an exacerbation and chronically infected with organisms of the  Burkholderia cepacia  complex. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of latest search: 29 May 2019. Selection criteria Randomised and quasiâ€randomised controlled trials of treatments for exacerbations of pulmonary symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis chronically infected with organisms of the  Burkholderia cepacia  complex. Data collection and analysis No relevant trials were identified. Main results No trials were included in this review. Authors' conclusions Burkholderia cepacia  complex infections present a significant challenge for people with cystic fibrosis and their clinicians. The incidence is likely to increase as the cystic fibrosis population ages; and managing and treating these infections will become more important. There is a lack of trial evidence to guide decision making and no conclusions can be drawn from this review about the optimal antibiotic regimens for people with cystic fibrosis who have chronic  Burkholderia cepacia  complex infections. Clinicians must continue to assess each person individually, taking into account in vitro antibiotic susceptibility data, previous clinical responses and their own experience. Multicentre randomised clinical trials are needed to assess the effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens in people with cystic fibrosis infected with organisms of the  Burkholderia cepacia  complex. Plain language summary Which antibiotics are best to treat worsening symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis with persistent  Burkholderia cepacia  complex lung infection? Review question We looked for evidence of which antibiotics are best to treat a flare up of symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis with persistent  Burkholderia cepacia  complex lung infection. Background Cystic fibrosis is a common inherited condition where the lungs often become blocked with mucus. This harms the lungs' defences and often results in chronic, persistent infections that cannot be cleared by antibiotics. People with cystic fibrosis often need courses of antibiotics to reduce their symptoms (for instance cough, excess mucus and breathlessness) when these flare up or worsen. Such episodes are called exacerbations, and are usually treated with intravenous antibiotics (given through a drip into a vein). One group of bacteria that can infect the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis is called the  Burkholderia cepacia  complex. These closelyâ€related bacteria are found widely in the environment and do not cause infections in healthy people who do not have cystic fibrosis. They are particularly hard to treat as they are resistant to many commonlyâ€used antibiotics. Currently doctors do not know which antibiotics are best at treating these infections; which combinations of antibiotics should be used; how long the antibiotics should be used for; or whether there are additional treatments that might also help. This is an update of a previously published review. Search date The evidence is current to: 29 May 2019. Study characteristics We did not find any trials in people with exacerbations of cystic fibrosis who were infected with  Burkholderia cepacia  complex bacteria, where they were given different treatments at random. Key results More research is needed to find out which treatments are best for improving lung function and survival and for reducing side effects and length of time spent in hospital for people infected with  Burkholderia cepacia  complex bacteria experiencing an exacerbation.",4,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Burkholderia cepacia complex; Antiâ€Bacterial Agents [*therapeutic use]; Burkholderia Infections [*drug therapy, microbiology]; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Disease Progression; Humans",10.1002/14651858.CD009529.pub4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009529.pub4,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,96.0
CD009528.PUB5,"Smith, S; Waters, V; Jahnke, N; Ratjen, F",Standard versus biofilm antimicrobial susceptibility testing to guide antibiotic therapy in cystic fibrosis,2020,"Abstract - Background Clinicians typically select the antibiotics used to treat pulmonary infections in people with cystic fibrosis based on the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing performed on bacteria traditionally grown in a planktonic mode (grown in a liquid). However, there is considerable evidence to suggest that  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  actually grows in a biofilm (or slime layer) in the airways of people with cystic fibrosis with chronic pulmonary infections. Therefore, choosing antibiotics based on biofilm rather than conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing could potentially improve response to treatment of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in people with cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives To compare biofilm antimicrobial susceptibility testingâ€driven therapy to conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testingâ€driven therapy in the treatment of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  infection in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Most recent search: 07 April 2020. We also searched two ongoing trials registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Most recent searches: 07 April 2020 and 05 September 2017. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of antibiotic therapy based on biofilm antimicrobial susceptibility testing compared to antibiotic therapy based on conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the treatment of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  pulmonary infection in people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected RCTs, assessed their risk of bias and extracted data from eligible trials. Additionally, the review authors contacted the trial investigators to obtain further information. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE criteria. Main results The searches identified two multicentre, doubleâ€blind RCTs eligible for inclusion in the review with a total of 78 participants (adults and children); one RCT was undertaken in people who were clinically stable, the second was in people experiencing pulmonary exacerbations. Both RCTs prospectively assessed whether the use of biofilm antimicrobial susceptibility testing improved microbiological and clinical outcomes in participants with cystic fibrosis who were infected with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa . The primary outcome was the change in sputum  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  density from the beginning to the end of antibiotic therapy. Although the intervention was shown to be safe, the data from these two RCTs did not provide evidence that biofilm susceptibility testing was superior to conventional susceptibility testing either in terms of microbiological or lung function outcomes. One of the trials also measured risk and time to subsequent exacerbation as well as quality of life measures and did not demonstrate any difference between groups in these outcomes. Both RCTs had an overall low risk of bias and the quality of the evidence using GRADE criteria was deemed to be moderate to high for the outcomes selected. Authors' conclusions The current evidence is insufficient to recommend choosing antibiotics based on biofilm antimicrobial susceptibility testing rather than conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the treatment of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  pulmonary infections in people with cystic fibrosis. Biofilm antimicrobial susceptibility testing may be more appropriate in the development of newer, more effective formulations of drugs which can then be tested in clinical trials. Plain language summary Standard versus biofilm antibiotic testing to guide antibiotic treatment in cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed evidence to see which testing method is better when deciding which antibiotics to use for treating a flare up of symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis; whether it is better to test antibiotics on  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  bacteria (bugs) when they are grown in a layer of slime (a biofilm) or when they are grown in liquid. We wanted to know if one of these methods would lead to better antibiotic choices with better clinical outcomes. Background Longâ€term lung infection is the main cause of death in people with cystic fibrosis. Antibiotic treatments for these infections have helped people with cystic fibrosis live longer. Doctors usually choose which antibiotics to use after on testing them against bacteria grown from samples taken from the infected person. These bacteria are grown in a liquid in the laboratory; but in real life bacteria such as  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  do not grow in liquid in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis, instead they grow in a slime layer called a biofilm. Laboratory testing of antibiotics against  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  grown in a biofilm rather than in a liquid may give results that lead to better antibiotic choices with better clinical outcomes when treating lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis. Search date We last looked for evidence on 07 April 2020. Study characteristics We included two trials, one run in the USA (in people who were clinically stable) and one run in Canada (in people who were having an exacerbation or respiratory flare up). A total of 78 people from these trials gave sputum samples. Bacteria from these samples were grown in either a liquid (34 samples) or biofilm (44 samples) with an equal chance of being grown in either one. Neither the people taking part or their clinicians knew before or during the trial which method had been used for the sample from each person. A mixture of adults and children took part in the trials, with the average age being around 20 to 30 years. There were an equal number of men and women in both trials. Around half the people in the trials had two copies of the delta F508 gene and there were almost equal number of these in each group. Average lung function in both groups was similar. Key results The main outcome of both trials was the decrease in the amount of bacteria in the sputum of people in each group after antibiotic treatment. There was no difference in the levels of bacteria found in the sputum or in the improvement in lung function between the two groups in either trial. In both trials, there was a similar number of individuals in each group who had either a mild or moderate side effect. There were no serious side effects reported by anyone in either study. The evidence does not show that one method of testing is better than the other and that people receiving antibiotics chosen on the basis of either method have equal chances of any side effects. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence was quite good as people had equal chances of being in either group and they did not know which testing group they were in. This means we don't think the trial results would have been affected because of this.",6,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Adolescent; Adult; Anti-Bacterial Agents [*therapeutic use]; Biofilms [*drug effects, growth & development]; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Female; Humans; Male; Microbial Sensitivity Tests [methods]; Pseudomonas Infections [complications, *drug therapy]; Pseudomonas aeruginosa [*drug effects, physiology]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Tract Infections [*drug therapy, microbiology]; Sputum [microbiology]",10.1002/14651858.CD009528.pub5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009528.pub5,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,59.0
CD012056.PUB3,"Palaniappan, SK; Than, NN; Thein, AW; van Mourik, I",Interventions for preventing and managing advanced liver disease in cystic fibrosis,2020,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive inherited defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene resulting in abnormal regulation of salt and water movement across the membranes. In the liver this leads to focal biliary fibrosis resulting in progressive portal hypertension and endâ€stage liver disease in some individuals. This can be asymptomatic, but may lead to splenomegaly and hypersplenism, development of varices and variceal bleeding, and ascites; it has negative impact on overall nutritional status and respiratory function in this population. Prognosis is poor once significant portal hypertension is established. The role and outcome of various interventions for managing advanced liver disease (nonâ€malignant end stage disease) in people with cystic fibrosis is currently unidentified. This is an updated version of a previously published review. Objectives To review and assess the efficacy of currently available treatment options for preventing and managing advanced liver disease in children and adults with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of last search: 19 November 2019. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews and online trials registries. Date of last search: 01 January 2020. Selection criteria Any published and unpublished randomised controlled trials and quasiâ€randomised controlled trials of advanced liver disease in cystic fibrosis with cirrhosis or liver failure, portal hypertension or variceal bleeding (or both). Data collection and analysis Authors independently examined titles and abstracts to identify potentially relevant trials, but none were eligible for inclusion in this review. Main results A comprehensive search of the literature did not identify any published eligible randomised controlled trials. Authors' conclusions In order to develop the best source of evidence, there is a need to undertake randomised controlled trials of interventions for preventing and managing advanced liver disease in adults and children with cystic fibrosis. Plain language summary Interventions for managing advanced liver disease in cystic fibrosis Review question We aimed to find the best evidence about preventing and managing advanced liver disease in adults and children with cystic fibrosis by comparing different treatment options. Background In advanced liver disease in cystic fibrosis, the normal liver tissue is replaced by scar tissue. As the disease progresses, the liver becomes hard and the blood cannot easily flow through the organ leading to increased pressure in an important blood vessel in the liver called the portal vein (portal hypertension). Later on, the veins around the lower part of the oesophagus (gullet) become swollen and torn, resulting in lifeâ€threatening bleeding (variceal bleeding). There are several treatments currently available for variceal bleeding and portal hypertension; drug treatments (nonâ€selective beta blockers), endoscopic therapy (e.g. band ligation where tiny elastic bands are placed around the enlarged veins to tie them off so they can't bleed), or sclerotherapy (where a bloodâ€clotting solution is injected directly into a vein and irritates the lining of the blood vessel so it swells and sticks together). The insertion of a transjugular intrahepatic portoâ€systemic shunt (also known as TIPSS) (an artificial channel within the liver that allows movement between the inflowing and out flowing veins) has been employed in recurrent bleeding or as a bridge to liver transplantation. Surgical portoâ€systemic shunts have also been used in selected patients with preserved liver function. Liver transplantation is performed in cystic fibrosis patients with decompensated cirrhosis or endâ€stage liver disease. Guidelines for screening and managing portal hypertension have been available for the general population (without cystic fibrosis). However, the optimal treatment for advanced liver disease in cystic fibrosis has not yet been defined, leading to a wide variety of practice among different centres. This is an updated version of a previously published review. Search date The evidence is current to: 19 November 2019. Study characteristics We searched for high quality trials comparing the treatments described above in children and adults with advanced liver disease in cystic fibrosis. Unfortunately, we did not find any trials to include in this review. Key results Since we did not find any trials for this review, it is not possible to make any specific recommendations or to develop bestâ€practice guidelines at this stage. Our review highlighted a clear need for randomised controlled trials of treatments for the prevention and management of advanced liver disease in adults and children with cystic fibrosis.",3,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Adult; Child; Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator [genetics]; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications, genetics]; Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage [prevention & control]; Humans; Hypertension, Portal [prevention & control]; Liver Diseases [etiology, prevention & control, *therapy]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",10.1002/14651858.CD012056.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012056.pub3,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,20.0
CD004730.PUB5,"Onady, GM; Stolfi, A",Drug treatments for managing cystic fibrosisâ€related diabetes,2020,"Abstract - Background The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation recommends both shortâ€term and longâ€acting insulin therapy when cystic fibrosisâ€related diabetes (CFRD) has been diagnosed. Diagnosis is based on: an elevated fasting blood glucose level greater than 6.94 mmol/L (125 mg/dL); or oral glucose tolerance tests greater than 11.11 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) at two hours; or symptomatic diabetes for random glucose levels greater than 11.11 mmol/L (200 mg/dL); or glycated hemoglobin levels of at least 6.5%. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To establish the effectiveness of insulin and oral agents for managing diabetes in people with cystic fibrosis in relation to blood sugar levels, lung function and weight management. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also handsearched abstracts from pulmonary symposia and the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conferences. Date of most recent register search: 10 September 2020. We searched online trials registries; date of most recent searches: 21 March 2020. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials comparing all methods of pharmacological diabetes therapy in people with diagnosed CFRD. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. Authors also used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. Main results The searches identified 29 trials (45 references). Four included trials provide results: one shortâ€term singleâ€center crossâ€over trial (seven adults) comparing insulin with oral repaglinide and no medication in adults with CFRD and normal fasting glucose; one longâ€term multicenter trial (61 adults with CFRD) comparing insulin with oral repaglinide and placebo; one longâ€term multicenter trial (67 adults) comparing insulin with oral repaglinide; and one 12â€week singleâ€center crossâ€over trial (20 adults) comparing the longâ€acting insulin glargine to shortâ€term neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin. Two ongoing trials of newly approved incretin mimics have been noted for possible future inclusion. Downgrading of the quality of the evidence was mainly due to risks of bias across all domains, but particularly due to concerns surrounding allocation concealment and selective reporting. There were also some concerns due to imprecision from small sample sizes and low event rates. Finally, there may be some bias due to the amounts of insulin and repaglinide given not being comparable. Data from one trial comparing insulin to placebo (39 participants) did not show any difference between groups for the primary outcomes of blood glucose levels (very lowâ€quality evidence), lung function (lowâ€quality evidence) or nutritional status (lowâ€quality evidence). Similarly, no differences between groups were seen for the secondary outcomes of number of hypoglycemic episodes (lowâ€quality evidence), secondary infection complications or quality of life (QoL). These results were mirrored in the narrative reports for the second trial in this comparison (seven participants). Data from the oneâ€year trial comparing repaglinide to placebo (38 participants), showed no differences between groups for the primary outcomes of blood glucose levels (very lowâ€quality evidence), lung function (lowâ€quality evidence) and nutritional status (lowâ€quality evidence). Also, no differences were seen between groups for the secondary outcomes of number of hypoglycemic episodes (lowâ€quality evidence), secondary infection complications or QoL. These findings were mirrored in the narrative reports for the second trial (n = 7) in this comparison. Three trials compared insulin to repaglinide (119 participants). Data from one trial (n = 67) showed no difference in blood glucose levels at either 12 months (highâ€quality evidence) or 24 months; narrative reports from one trial (45 participants) reported no difference between groups, but the second trial (7 participants) reported a beneficial effect of insulin over repaglinide. Two trials (112 participants) found no difference between insulin and repaglinide in lung function or nutritional status (moderateâ€quality evidence). Two trials (56 participants) reported no difference in the number of hypoglycemic episodes (lowâ€quality evidence). One trial (45 participants) reported no difference between groups in secondary infections and cystic fibrosis QoL. The single trial comparing glargine to neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin did not report directly on the review's primary outcomes, but did report no differences between groups in postâ€prandial glucose values and weight; neither group reported infectious complications. There was no difference in episodes of hypoglycemia (very lowâ€quality evidence) and while there was no difference reported in QoL, all participants opted to continue treatment with glargine after the trial was completed. Mortality was not reported by any trial in any comparison, but death was not given as a reason for withdrawal in any trial. Authors' conclusions This review has not found any conclusive evidence that any agent has a distinct advantage over another in controlling hyperglycemia or the clinical outcomes associated with CFRD. Given the treatment burden already experienced by people with cystic fibrosis, oral therapy may be a viable treatment option. While some cystic fibrosis centers use oral medications to help control diabetes, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (USA) clinical practice guidelines support the use of insulin therapy and this remains the most widelyâ€used treatment method. Randomized controlled trials specifically related to controlling diabetes and its impact on the course of pulmonary disease process in cystic fibrosis continue to be a high priority. Specifically, investigators should evaluate adherence to different therapies and also whether there is benefit in using additional hypoglycemic agents as well as the newly approved incretin mimics. Agents that potentiate insulin action, especially agents with additional antiâ€inflammatory potential should also be further investigated as adjuvant therapy to insulin. Plain language summary Drug treatments for managing cystic fibrosisâ€related diabetes Review question We reviewed the evidence regarding different drugs for managing cystic fibrosisâ€related diabetes (CFRD). Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common lifeâ€limiting genetic condition, mainly causing damage to the lungs and pancreas. The pancreas makes insulin, a hormone which the body needs to take sugar into the cells so it can be converted into energy. In up to 90% of people with CF, problems with the pancreas and digestive enzymes mean nutrients are not properly absorbed. People with CF need highâ€calorie and highâ€protein diets to provide enough energy to maintain muscle mass so as to support their breathing and make up for breathing difficulties from diseaseâ€damaged lungs. It is important for people with CF to turn sugar into energy efficiently. This is especially challenging for people with CFRD because damage to the pancreas affects insulin production and release. Inflammation seen in CF can reduce insulin production and lessen its effect by causing insulin resistance. Increased life expectancy for people with CF means that 50% of adults with CF are likely to develop CFRD. We wanted to assess different treatments for CFRD to limit any related decline in health. These include artificial sources of insulin (like longâ€acting glargine or shortâ€acting protamine insulin), the control of natural hormones that stimulate insulin release and medications that enhance a personâ€™s own insulin release or affect insulin resistance. Search date The evidence is current to: 10 September 2020. Study characteristics We included four trials (145 adults). Two trials compared insulin to either no treatment for two months (seven participants) or to a placebo (dummy drug with no active medication) for one year (61 participants). These trials, along with a third trial lasting two years (67 adults), also compared insulin (given via a syringe) to repaglinide tablets. The fourth trial (20 participants) compared the longâ€acting insulin glargine to shortâ€term neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin over a 12â€week period. Key results We found results for our primary outcomes of blood glucose levels, lung function and nutritional status and our secondary outcomes of pulmonary exacerbations (flare up of disease), complications and quality of life. We could only analyse limited results and did not find evidence that showed that any one treatment was better than another. Our analysis did not show that either insulin or repaglinide made any difference to any of our outcomes compared to placebo or no treatment at any time point. Similarly, most of our results did not show whether insulin or repaglinide was better, but the evidence was a little stronger that there was no difference in lung function, nutritional status or blood glucose levels at 12 months. Similarly, the evidence was not strong enough to show if there is any difference between glargine and neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin for any of our outcome measures. None of the trials reported if there were any deaths. Given the treatment burden already experienced by people with CF, tablets may be a welcome alternative to injecting insulin. Longerâ€term trials with larger numbers of people are still needed to see how controlling CFRD affects lung function. Investigators should also assess how many people keep to their treatment plan when comparing insulin to tablets. Research should look at using the drugs by themselves or together with insulin to enhance insulin action, especially those agents with additional antiâ€inflammatory potential. Quality of the evidence We had some concerns about the quality of the evidence; mainly that there would be bias because clinicians probably knew in advance which treatment group the next person was going to be put into (e.g. healthier participants might be put into one group to show better results for that treatment) or bias from people taking part knowing which treatment group they were in (e.g. insulin via a syringe or repaglinide as a tablet). There may also be bias because results may only be selectively reported. We had some concerns that the analysis would not be precise due to small numbers of participants and low event rates. Finally, there may be bias in the results as the amounts of insulin and repaglinide given were not comparable.",10,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Administration, Oral; Bias; Blood Glucose [analysis]; Carbamates [administration & dosage]; Cystic Fibrosis [blood, *complications]; Diabetes Mellitus [blood, *drug therapy, etiology]; Fasting [blood]; Humans; Hyperglycemia [drug therapy]; Hypoglycemic Agents [*administration & dosage]; Insulin Glargine [administration & dosage]; Insulin [*administration & dosage]; Insulin, Isophane [administration & dosage]; Piperidines [administration & dosage]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",10.1002/14651858.CD004730.pub5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004730.pub5,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,29.0
CD013018.PUB2,"Oliveira, VHB; MendonÃ§a, KMPP; Monteiro, KS; Silva, IS; Santino, TA; Nogueira, PAMS",Physical therapies for postural abnormalities in people with cystic fibrosis,2020,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lifeâ€threatening, inherited disease in white populations which causes several dysfunctions, including postural abnormalities. Physical therapy may help in some consequences of these postural abnormalities, such as pain, trunk deformity and quality of life. Objectives To determine the effects of a range of physical therapies for managing postural abnormalities in people with cystic fibrosis, specifically on quality of life, pain and trunk deformity. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches, handâ€searched journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Additional searches were conducted on ClinicalTrials.gov and on the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for any planned, ongoing and unpublished studies. Date of the last search: 19 March 2020. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials examining any modality of physical therapy considered relevant for treating postural disorders compared with each other, no physical therapy, sham treatment or usual care in people with CF (of any age or disease severity). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected eligible trials, assessed the risk of bias in each trial and extracted the data. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing or additional information. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE criteria. Main results Two trials, involving a total of 50 participants with CF and postural abnormalities, were included in this review. One was in people with stable disease (lasting three months) and one in hospital inpatients experiencing an exacerbation (20 days). Both trials compared manual therapy comprising mobilizations to the rib cage and thoracic spine, treatment of specific muscle dysfunction or tight muscle groups; and postural awareness and education versus medical usual care. The age of participants ranged from 17 years to 58 years. Both trials were conducted in the UK. The following outcomes were measured: change in quality of life, change in pain, change in trunk deformity and change in pulmonary function. Manual therapy may make little or no difference to the change in trunk deformity compared to usual care (lowâ€quality evidence). No results could be analysed for quality of life (very lowâ€quality evidence) and pain outcomes (very lowâ€quality evidence) because of the high heterogeneity between trials. It is uncertain whether the intervention improves lung function: forced vital capacity (very lowâ€quality evidence); forced expiratory volume in one second (very lowâ€quality evidence); or Tiffeneauâ€™s index (ratio of forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC)). Only one trial (15 participants) measured functional capacity, and the change in walked distance seemed to favour intervention over usual care, but with the possibility of no effect due to wide confidence intervals. The same trial also reported that six participants in the intervention group had positive comments about the intervention and no adverse events were mentioned. Authors' conclusions Due to methodological limitations in the included trials, and in addition to the very low to low quality of the current evidence, there is limited evidence about the benefits of physical therapies on postural abnormalities in people with CF. Therefore, further wellâ€conducted trials with robust methodologies are required considering a prior inclusion criterion to identify the participants who have postural abnormalities. Plain language summary Physical therapies for postural abnormalities in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effects of physical therapies that can help the postural abnormalities in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease that causes problems in some organs of the body, especially in the lungs. Recently, it has been noticed that postural abnormalities may happen because of the disease progression. Some physical therapies that promote the stretching and strengthening of the muscles connected to the spine may help improving the pain and quality of life in people with cystic fibrosis. Search date The evidence is current to: 19 March 2020. Study characteristics We included two trials in this review with 50 participants aged between 17 and 58 years and diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and postural abnormalities. The trials compared manual therapy (all physical therapies that promote relaxation of the muscles, as well as mobilization of the spine, such as massage, spinal mobilization) with usual care (the normal treatment they used to receive). Participants were placed in each treatment group at random. One trial was in hospital inpatients and lasted 20 days and the second was in outpatients and lasted three months. Most of the outcomes were reported in both trials. Key results The trials did not find any difference between manual therapy and usual care for changes in trunk deformity. We could not combine results for quality of life or pain scores because they were too different. We were not able to find a difference between manual therapy and usual care for lung function. Only one trial (15 participants) measured the change in walked distance which seemed to favour manual therapy over usual care, but this was not clear because there were a large range of results. One trial reported that participants from the manual therapy group enjoyed the type of the treatment they received and that adherence was also high. None of the trials reported any side effects. Quality of the evidence Overall, there was only lowâ€ to very lowâ€quality of evidence in all outcomes considered. Lowâ€quality evidence means that our confidence in the effect of manual therapy is limited and the true effect may be very different. We think the fact that people knew which treatment they were receiving can affect the results for the change in quality of life, change in pain and change in lung function outcomes, but this may not affect the other outcomes. Therefore, we are still not confident that manual therapies improve outcomes that we consider important for the treatment of postural abnormalities.",3,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,*Pain Management; *Physical Therapy Modalities; *Quality of Life; Cystic Fibrosis [*physiopathology]; Humans; Posture; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic,10.1002/14651858.CD013018.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013018.pub2,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,4.0
CD010004.PUB5,"Waters, V; Ratjen, F",Antibiotic treatment for nontuberculous mycobacteria lung infection in people with cystic fibrosis,2020,"Abstract - Background Nontuberculous mycobacteria are mycobacteria, other than those in the  Mycobacterium tuberculosis  complex, and are commonly found in the environment. Nontuberculous mycobacteria species (most commonly  Mycobacterium avium  complex and  Mycobacterium abscessus ) are isolated from the respiratory tract of approximately 5% to 40% of individuals with cystic fibrosis; they can cause lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis leading to more a rapid decline in lung function and even death in certain circumstances. Although there are guidelines for the antimicrobial treatment of nontuberculous mycobacteria lung disease, these recommendations are not specific for people with cystic fibrosis and it is not clear which antibiotic regimen may be the most effective in the treatment of these individuals. This is an update of a previous review. Objectives The objective of our review was to compare antibiotic treatment to no antibiotic treatment, or to compare different combinations of antibiotic treatment, for nontuberculous mycobacteria lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis. The primary objective was to assess the effect of treatment on lung function and pulmonary exacerbations and to quantify adverse events. The secondary objectives were to assess treatment effects on the amount of bacteria in the sputum, quality of life, mortality, nutritional parameters, hospitalizations and use of oral antibiotics. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and hand searching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of last search: 24 February 2020. We also searched a register of ongoing trials and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 21 March 2019. Selection criteria Any randomized controlled trials comparing nontuberculous mycobacteria antibiotics to no antibiotic treatment, as well as one nontuberculous mycobacteria antibiotic regimen compared to another nontuberculous mycobacteria antibiotic regimen, in individuals with cystic fibrosis.   Data collection and analysis Data were not collected because in the one trial identified by the search, data specific to individuals with cystic fibrosis could not be obtained from the pharmaceutical company. Main results One completed trial was identified by the searches, but data specific to individuals with cystic fibrosis could not be obtained from the pharmaceutical company. Authors' conclusions This review did not find any evidence for the effectiveness of different antimicrobial treatment for nontuberculous mycobacteria lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis. Until such evidence becomes available, it is reasonable for clinicians to follow published clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of nodular or bronchiectatic pulmonary disease due to  Mycobacterium avium  complex or  Mycobacterium abscessus  in patients with cystic fibrosis. Plain language summary Antibiotic treatment for nontuberculous mycobacteria in people with cystic fibrosis  Nontuberculous mycobacteria are bacteria that are in the same family as tuberculosis and are commonly found in the soil and water. These bacteria can be found in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis and can cause their lung function to worsen. Although there are guidelines on which antibiotics to use to treat lung infection due to these bacteria, these recommendations are not specific for people with cystic fibrosis. It is also not clear which are the most effective antibiotics. The main purpose of this review was to determine whether treatment with different antibiotic combinations for nontuberculous mycobacterial infection would improve lung function or decrease the frequency of chest infections in people with cystic fibrosis. We found one randomized controlled trial but it included both people with and without cystic fibrosis and we could not get the information specifically about individuals with cystic fibrosis so could not include the information in this review. Until the time when such information is available, clinicians should follow the current guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of lung infections due to nontuberculous mycobacteria in the general population. Review question We reviewed the evidence about using antibiotics to treat nontuberculous mycobacteria infection in people with cystic fibrosis.

CD002201.PUB6,"Watson, H; Stackhouse, C",Omegaâ€3 fatty acid supplementation for cystic fibrosis,2020,"Abstract - Background Studies suggest that a diet rich in omegaâ€3 essential fatty acids may have beneficial antiâ€inflammatory effects for chronic conditions such as cystic fibrosis. This is an updated version of a previously published review. Objectives To determine whether there is evidence that omegaâ€3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation reduces morbidity and mortality and to identify any adverse events associated with supplementation. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of last search: 01 April 2020. We also searched online study registries and contacted authors. Date of last search: 12 February 2020. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials in people with cystic fibrosis comparing omegaâ€3 fatty acid supplements with placebo. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the studies. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Main results The searches identified 23 studies; five studies with 106 participants (children and adults) were included; duration of studies and interventions differed. Two studies compared omegaâ€3 fatty acids to olive oil for six weeks; one study compared omegaâ€3 fatty acids and omegaâ€6 fatty acids to control capsules (customised fatty acid blends) for three months; one study compared a liquid dietary supplement containing omegaâ€3 fatty acids to one without for six months; and one study compared omegaâ€3 fatty acids to a placebo for 12 months. Three studies had a low risk of bias for randomisation, but the risk was unclear in the remaining two studies; all studies had an unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment. Three of the studies adequately blinded participants; the risk of bias for selective reporting was high in one study and unclear for four studies. Two studies reported the number of respiratory exacerbations. At three months, one study (43 participants) reported no change in antibiotic usage. At 12 months the second study (15 participants) reported a reduction in the number of pulmonary exacerbations and cumulative antibiotic days in the supplement group compared to the previous year (no data for the control group); very lowâ€quality evidence means we are unsure whether supplementation has any effect on this outcome. With regards to adverse events, one sixâ€week study (12 participants) reported no difference in diarrhoea between omegaâ€3 or placebo capsules; the very lowâ€quality evidence means we are unsure if supplementation has any effect on this outcome. Additionally, one study reported an increase in steatorrhoea requiring participants to increase their daily dose of pancreatic enzymes, but three studies had already increased pancreatic enzyme dose at study begin so as to reduce the incidence of steatorrhoea. One study (43 participants) reported stomach pains at three months (treatment or control group not specified). One sixâ€week study (19 participants) reported three asthma exacerbations leading to exclusion of participants since corticosteroid treatment could affect affect essential fatty acid metabolism. Four studies reported lung function. One sixâ€week study (19 participants) reported an increase in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) (L) and forced vital capacity (FVC) (L), but the very lowâ€quality evidence means we are unsure if supplementation has any effect on lung function. The remaining studies did not report any difference in lung function at three months (unit of measurement not specified) or at six months and one year (FEV 1  % predicted and FVC % predicted). No deaths were reported in any of the five studies. Four studies reported clinical variables. One study reported an increase in Schwachman score and weight alongside a reduction in sputum volume with supplementation compared to placebo at three months (data not analysable). However, three studies reported no differences in either weight at six weeks, in body mass index (BMI) standard deviation (SD) score at six months (very lowâ€quality evidence) or BMI Z score at 12 months. Three studies reported biochemical markers of fatty acid status. One study showed an increase from baseline in both EPA and DHA content of serum phospholipids in the omegaâ€3 group compared to placebo at three months and also a significant decrease in nâ€6/nâ€3 ratio in the supplement group compared to placebo; since the quality of the evidence is very low we are not certain that these changes are due to supplementation. One sixâ€month crossâ€over study showed a higher EPA content of the neutrophil membrane in the supplement group compared to the placebo group, but, no difference in DHA membrane concentration. Furthermore, the leukotriene B 4  to leukotriene B 5  ratio was lower at six months in the omegaâ€3 group compared to placebo. A oneâ€year study reported a greater increase in the essential fatty acid profile and a decrease in AA levels in the treatment arm compared to placebo. Authors' conclusions This review found that regular omegaâ€3 supplements may provide some limited benefits for people with cystic fibrosis with relatively few adverse effects: however, the quality of the evidence across all outcomes was very low. The current evidence is insufficient to draw firm conclusions or recommend routine use of these supplements in people with cystic fibrosis. A large, longâ€term, multicentre, randomised controlled study is needed to determine any significant therapeutic effect and to assess the influence of disease severity, dosage and duration of treatment. Future researchers should note the need for additional pancreatic enzymes when providing omegaâ€3 supplementation or olive oil placebo capsules. More research is required to determine the exact dose of pancreatic enzyme required. Plain language summary The use of omegaâ€3 supplements in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of giving omegaâ€3 supplements to people with cystic fibrosis. Background In people with cystic fibrosis recurring cycles of infection and inflammation are thought to worsen lung function. Studies suggest that omegaâ€3 fatty acids, such as those derived from fish oils, may work to counter the inflammation and may be of benefit in chronic inflammatory diseases including cystic fibrosis. This is an updated version of the review. Search date The evidence is current to: 01 April 2020. Study characteristics This review includes five small studies which compare omegaâ€3 supplements to a different supplement without omegaâ€3. In total there were 106 participants, including both children and adults. The studies lasted between six weeks and 12 months. Key results Due to the very lowâ€quality evidence, we are uncertain whether the following effects are due to supplementation or not. One 12â€month study reported a reduction in pulmonary exacerbations and antibiotic use when taking omegaâ€3 supplementation compared to placebo and one threeâ€month study reported no change in antibiotic use during the study period. Few side effects were reported in any of the studies. One sixâ€week study reported that lung function and clinical status improved when taking omegaâ€3 supplements. Sputum levels were also noted to be reduced in this sixâ€week study. Three studies reported no difference in lung function when taking omegaâ€3 supplementation compared to placebo. Two longer studies found that people taking omegaâ€3 supplements showed definite increases in levels of essential fatty acids in their white blood cell membranes and also in levels of phospholipids (molecules that provide structure and protection to cells) measured in blood samples. We are uncertain whether regular omegaâ€3 supplements benefit people with cystic fibrosis and whether they cause side effects, or not. We are not able to draw firm conclusions or recommend the routine use of these supplements in people with cystic fibrosis. Larger and longer studies are needed to assess the clinical benefit of omegaâ€3 supplementation and to determine the appropriate dosage. Quality of the evidence We judged the quality of the evidence to be very low due to very low participant numbers, low event rates, limited reporting and poor study design. There was no consistency with regards to the time points when results were reported or the measurements used for the same outcome in different studies.",4,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Dietary Supplements; Adult; Bias; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [blood, *diet therapy]; Disease Progression; Fatty Acids, Omegaâ€3 [*administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Fatty Acids, Omegaâ€6 [administration & dosage]; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Olive Oil [administration & dosage]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Vital Capacity",10.1002/14651858.CD002201.pub6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002201.pub6,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,161.0
CD008816.PUB4,"Elkins, M; Dentice, R",Timing of hypertonic saline inhalation for cystic fibrosis,2020,"Abstract - Background Inhalation of hypertonic saline improves sputum rheology, accelerates mucociliary clearance and improves clinical outcomes of people with cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives To determine whether the timing of hypertonic saline inhalation (in relation to airway clearance techniques or in relation to time of day) has an impact on its clinical efficacy in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We identified relevant randomised and quasiâ€randomised controlled trials from the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), and international cystic fibrosis conference proceedings. Date of the last search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 28 February 2019. Selection criteria Any trial of hypertonic saline in people with cystic fibrosis where timing of inhalation was the randomised element in the study protocol with either: inhalation up to six hours before airway clearance techniques compared to inhalation during airway clearance techniques compared to inhalation up to six hours after airway clearance techniques; or morning compared to evening inhalation with any definition provided by the author. Data collection and analysis Both authors independently assessed the trials identified by the search for potential inclusion in the review. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Main results The searches identified 104 trial reports which represented 51 trials, of which three crossâ€over trials (providing data on 77 participants) met our inclusion criteria. We present three comparisons: inhalation before versus during airway clearance techniques; inhalation before versus after airway clearance techniques; and inhalation during versus after airway clearance techniques. One trial (50 participants), given its threeâ€arm design, was eligible for all three comparisons. No trials compared morning versus evening inhalation of hypertonic saline. The evidence from the three trials was judged to be of low quality downgraded for limitations (high risk of bias due to blinding) and indirectness (all participants are adults, and therefore not applicable to children). Intervention periods ranged from one treatment to three treatments in one day. There were no clinically important differences between the timing regimens of inhaling hypertonic saline before, during or after airway clearance techniques in the mean amount of improvement in lung function or symptom scores (77 participants), with the betweenâ€group comparisons being nonâ€significant (lowâ€certainty evidence). While there may be little or no difference in the rating of satisfaction when hypertonic saline was inhaled before versus during the airway clearance techniques (64 participants) (with the 95% confidence interval including the possibility of both a higher and lower rating of satisfaction), satisfaction may be lower on a 100â€mm scale when inhaled after the airway clearance techniques compared to before: mean difference (MD) 20.38 mm (95% confidence interval (CI) 12.10 to 28.66) and when compared to during the techniques, MD 14.80 mm (95% CI 5.70 to 23.90). Perceived effectiveness showed similar results: little or no difference for inhalation before versus during airway clearance techniques (64 participants); may be lower when inhaled after the airway clearance techniques compared to before, MD 10.62 (95% CI 2.54 to 18.70); and also when compared to during the techniques, MD 15.60 (95% CI 7.55 to 23.65). There were no quality of life or adverse events reported in any of the trials. Authors' conclusions Timing of hypertonic saline inhalation makes little or no difference to lung function (lowâ€certainty evidence). However, inhaling hypertonic saline before or during airway clearance techniques may maximise perceived efficacy and satisfaction. The longâ€term efficacy of hypertonic saline has only been established for twiceâ€daily inhalations; however, if only one dose per day is tolerated, the time of day at which it is inhaled could be based on convenience or tolerability until evidence comparing these regimens is available. The identified trials were all of very short intervention periods, so longerâ€term research could be conducted to establish the effects arising from regular use, which would incorporate the influence of changes in adherence with longâ€term use, as well as generating data on any adverse effects that occur with longâ€term use. Plain language summary The timing of inhalation of hypertonic saline in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about whether the timing (in relation to airway clearance techniques or in relation to time of day) of hypertonic saline (a strong, sterile, salt water solution) through a nebuliser improves the physical properties of sputum, stimulates cough, improves clinical outcomes (such as lung function), and improves the perceived effect of airway clearance techniques in cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Background Regular inhalation of hypertonic saline improves the clinical outcomes of people with cystic fibrosis. It is not certain whether it is better to inhale hypertonic saline before, during or after clearing the airways with physical techniques, nor whether it is better to inhale it in the morning or in the evening. We looked for trials that compared these different timing regimens. Search date The evidence is current to: 28 February 2019. Study characteristics The review included three studies with 77 people with cystic fibrosis aged between 18 and 64 years of age .  The studies looked at the impact of the timing of hypertonic saline inhalation in relation to airway clearance techniques. The studies reported immediate outcomes after inhalation of hypertonic saline before, during or after physical airway clearance techniques. All studies were short, involving only one to three treatments of each timing regimen. Key results While outcomes such as lung function did not show any difference between the regimens, people with cystic fibrosis perceived that inhaling hypertonic saline before or during airway clearance techniques may be more effective and satisfying than inhaling hypertonic saline after airway clearance. No studies comparing morning and evening inhalation were found. The longâ€term efficacy of hypertonic saline has only been established for twiceâ€daily inhalations; however, if only one dose per day is tolerated, the time of day at which it is inhaled could be based on convenience or tolerability until further evidence is available. Quality of the evidence Overall, the quality of the evidence was low. The only issues perhaps affecting the quality related to the fact that it was not possible for participants to be blinded to the treatment they received. However, because the studies were shortâ€term and most of the significant results were based on perceived efficacy, timing of administration of hypertonic saline needs further study.",2,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Mucociliary Clearance; Administration, Inhalation; Cystic Fibrosis [*drug therapy]; Drug Administration Schedule; Humans; Saline Solution, Hypertonic [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]; Sputum [metabolism]",10.1002/14651858.CD008816.pub4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008816.pub4,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,38.0
CD008227.PUB4,"Somaraju, URR; Solis-Moya, A",Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy for people with cystic fibrosis,2020,"Abstract - Background Most people with cystic fibrosis (CF) (80% to 90%) need pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) to prevent malnutrition. Enzyme preparations need to be taken whenever food is taken, and the dose needs to be adjusted according to the food consumed. A systematic review on the efficacy and safety of PERT is needed to guide clinical practice, as there is variability between centres with respect to assessment of pancreatic function, time of commencing treatment, dose and choice of supplements. This is an updated version of a published review. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of PERT in children and adults with CF and to compare the efficacy and safety of different formulations of PERT and their appropriateness in different age groups. Also, to compare the effects of PERT in CF according to different diagnostic subgroups (e.g. different ages at introduction of therapy and different categories of pancreatic function). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Most recent search: 07 November 2019. We also searched an ongoing trials website and the websites of the pharmaceutical companies who manufacture pancreatic enzyme replacements for any additional trials. Most recent search: 26 December 2019. Selection criteria Randomised and quasiâ€randomised controlled trials in people of any age, with CF and receiving PERT, at any dosage and in any formulation, for a period of not less than four weeks, compared to placebo or other PERT preparations. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trials and extracted outcome data. They also assessed the risk of bias and quality of the evidence (GRADE) of the trials included in the review. Main results 14 trials were included in the review (641 children and adults with CF), two of these were parallel trials and 12 were crossâ€over trials. Interventions included different enteric and nonâ€entericâ€coated preparations of varying formulations in comparison to each other. The number of participants in each trial varied between 14 and 129. 13 trials were for a duration of four weeks and one trial lasted seven weeks. The majority of the trials had an unclear risk of bias from the randomisation process as the details of this were not given; they also had a high risk of attrition bias and reporting bias. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. We mostly could not combine data from the trials as they compared different formulations and the findings from individual trials provided insufficient evidence to determine the size and precision of the effects of different formulations. Authors' conclusions There is limited evidence of benefit from entericâ€coated microspheres when compared to nonâ€enteric coated pancreatic enzyme preparations up to one month. In the only comparison where we could combine any data, the fact that these were crossâ€over trials is likely to underestimate the level of inconsistency between the results of the trials due to overâ€inflation of CIs from the individual trials.There is no evidence on the longâ€term effectiveness and risks associated with PERT. There is also no evidence on the relative dosages of enzymes needed for people with different levels of severity of pancreatic insufficiency, optimum time to start treatment and variations based on differences in meals and meal sizes .  There is a need for a properly designed trial that can answer these questions. Plain language summary Pancreatic enzyme supplements for people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about how good pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) is in overcoming the enzyme deficiency in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) and if there are any side effects. Background Between 80% and 90% of people with CF take PERT because their pancreas can not make the enzymes needed to digest food. As a result, children may fail to gain weight and thrive; while adults may lose weight and become malnourished as they do not absorb vitamins properly. In people with CF, malnutrition is linked to poorer general health, more severe lung disease and shorter life expectancy. If their pancreas is not making enough enzymes, people with CF can also experience painful, frequent, bulky, offensive bowel movements. PERT is needed to help gain weight, prevent malnutrition and avoid some vitamin deficiencies, as well as to control bowel symptoms. This is an updated version of the review. Search date We last searched for evidence: 26 December 2019. Study characteristics We assessed 14 trials (641 adults and children with CF); 13 trials gave treatment for four weeks and one for seven weeks. Trials compared different formulations of PERT, some were treated to delay the release of the medication until they passed from the stomach into the intestine, while others were not. In 12 trials participants took both types of supplement for four weeks each, although the order in which they took them was random. These factors made it difficult to analyse trial results. Most of the trials were old; the most recent was from 2017, but the oldest was from 1986. Key results We are uncertain whether any PERT formulation is better than another for improving any of our most important outcomes (weight, height or body mass index). In two trials (41 participants) those taking delayedâ€release microspheres (miniature drug capsules) had less fat in their poo than those taking delayedâ€release tablets (normal size); they also had less abdominal pain and did not need to go to the toilet as often. In a different trial (12 participants), those taking the delayedâ€release microspheres also had less fat in their poo than those taking delayedâ€release supplements. We also found that in a large trial (128 participants), people taking PERT not made from animal enzymes had less fat in their poo than those taking PERT made from pigs' enzymes. We found no difference between any of the different PERT formulations for any other bowel symptoms (e.g. abdominal pain, flatulence, constipation), quality of life, side effects or for any measure of lung disease. None of the trials reported the number of days in hospital or the incidence of vitamin deficiency. We did not find any evidence on different dose levels of PERT needed for people who produce different levels of pancreatic enzymes, on the best time to start treatment or for the amounts of supplements based on differences in type of food eaten and meal sizes .  A properly designed trial is needed to answer these questions. Quality of the evidence We found the quality of the evidence for the different outcomes to be moderate at best, but mostly very low. We are not sure that the participants had equal chances of being put into the different treatment groups as the trials gave no details about how the decisions were made. In several trials large numbers of participants dropped out and reasons for this were often not given. In most trials, people took one treatment for four weeks and then swapped to the alternative treatment. This design means that the results may appear more consistent than they really are when we analyse them. The only results we could combine were from two such trials. Finally, several trials did not completely report their findings in a way we could analyse in this review. We are not sure how these factors affect our confidence in the results we found.",8,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Abdominal Pain [epidemiology]; Adult; Age Factors; Capsules [administration & dosage]; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*therapy]; Delayed-Action Preparations; Enzyme Replacement Therapy [adverse effects, *standards]; Gastrointestinal Agents [therapeutic use]; Humans; Microspheres; Nutritional Status; Pancreas [enzymology]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Weight Gain",10.1002/14651858.CD008227.pub4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008227.pub4,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,87.0
CD008482.PUB6,"Jagannath, VA; Thaker, V; Chang, AB; Price, AI",Vitamin K supplementation for cystic fibrosis,2020,"Abstract - Background Malabsorption and deficiency of fatâ€soluble vitamins K may occur in cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder affecting multiple organs. Vitamin K is known to play an important role in both blood coagulation and bone formation, hence the role of supplementation of vitamin K in this category needs to be reviewed. This is an updated version of the review. Objectives To assess the effects of vitamin K supplementation in people with cystic fibrosis and to investigate the hypotheses that vitamin K will decrease deficiencyâ€related coagulopathy, increase bone mineral density, decrease risk of fractures and improve quality of life in people with CF. Also to determine the optimal dose and route of administration of vitamin K for people with CF (for both routine and therapeutic use). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Most recent search: 12 August 2019. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of all preparations of vitamin K used as a supplement compared to either no supplementation (or placebo) at any dose or route and for any duration, in patients with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened papers, extracted trial details and assessed their risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE criteria. Main results Three trials (total 70 participants, aged 8 to 46 years) assessed as having a moderate risk of bias were included. One trial compared vitamin K to placebo, a second to no supplementation and the third compared two doses of vitamin K. No trial in either comparison reported our primary outcomes of coagulation and quality of life or the secondary outcomes of nutritional parameters and adverse events. Vitamin K versus control Two trials compared vitamin K to control, but data were not available for analysis. One 12â€month trial (n = 38) compared 10 mg vitamin K daily or placebo in a parallel design and one trial (n = 18) was of crossâ€over design with no washout period and compared 5 mg vitamin K/week for fourâ€weeks to no supplementation for fourâ€weeks. Only the 12â€month trial reported on the primary outcome of bone formation; we are very uncertain whether vitamin K supplementation has any effect on bone mineral density at the femoral hip or lumbar spine (very lowâ€quality evidence). Both trials reported an increase in serum vitamin K levels and a decrease in undercarboxylated osteocalcin levels. The crossâ€over trial also reported that levels of proteins induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKA) showed a decrease and a return to normal following supplementation, but due to the very lowâ€quality evidence we are not certain that this is due to the intervention. Highâ€dose versus lowâ€dose vitamin K One parallel trial (n = 14) compared 1 mg vitamin K/day to 5 mg vitamin K/day for four weeks. The trial did report that there did not appear to be any difference in serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin or vitamin K levels (very lowâ€quality evidence). While the trial reported that serum vitamin K levels improved with supplementation, there was no difference between the highâ€dose and lowâ€dose groups. Authors' conclusions There is very lowâ€quality evidence of any effect of vitamin K in people with cystic fibrosis. While there is no evidence of harm, until better evidence is available the ongoing recommendations by national CF guidelines should be followed. Plain language summary Vitamin K supplementation for cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence to see whether supplementing vitamin K in people with cystic fibrosis counteracts the effects of deficiency on blood clotting, bone strength and quality of life in people with cystic fibrosis. We tried to determine the best dose needed to prevent this deficiency. This is an update of an earlier review. Background Cystic fibrosis is an inherited condition which causes disease, most noticeably in the lungs, digestive system and pancreas. In people with cystic fibrosis, the pancreas often does not produce enough enzymes to allow the body to absorb digested food properly and this may also be linked to deficiencies of fatâ€soluble vitamins like vitamin K. Vitamin K is needed for adequate blood clotting, bone formation and some metabolic functions. Search date The evidence is current to: 12 August 2019. Study characteristics We included three trials (total of 70 participants aged between 8 and 46 years) in the review. Two trials compared vitamin K to a control. In the first trial all 18 people taking part (aged 13 to 35 years) were given 5 mg oral vitamin K supplement once a week or nothing for a total duration of one month and then they swapped to the other group for another month. Unfortunately, we could not analyse the data from this trial because the investigators did not report data just from the first part of the trial (only from the end of the trial when everyone taking part had been in both groups), so we could not tell if the effects were due to supplements or no supplements. In the second trial a total of 38 people aged 16 to 45 years took part. They were given either 10 mg vitamin K or placebo (a dummy supplement not containing any vitamin K) every day for 12 months, but the investigators did not state how many people were in each group so we could not analyse the results. In the third trial (14 children aged 8 to 18 years old) participants were given oral vitamin K supplements, half of them at a dose of 1 mg every day and the other half were given 5 mg every day for one month. Key results No trial in either comparison reported our primary outcomes of blood clotting and quality of life or the secondary measures of nutrition and adverse events. Vitamin K versus control Only the 12â€month trial reported on the primary outcome of bone formation; we are very uncertain whether vitamin K supplementation has any effect on bone mineral density measured at the hip or lower back (very lowâ€quality evidence). Both trials reported an increase in vitamin K levels in the blood and a decrease in undercarboxylated osteocalcin levels (this is an indicator of the risk of hip fracture). The fourâ€week trial also reported that levels of proteins induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKA) dropped and returned to normal levels, but due to the very lowâ€quality evidence we are not certain that this is due to supplementation. Highâ€dose versus lowâ€dose vitamin K The trial reported that while vitamin K levels improved there did not seem to be any difference between the highâ€dose and lowâ€dose groups. There also did not seem to be any difference in undercarboxylated osteocalcin levels (very lowâ€quality evidence). Quality of the evidence The overall quality of the evidence was judged to be very low due to risks of bias in the design of all trials and the low numbers of participants.",6,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Adolescent; Adult; Biomarkers [blood]; Blood Coagulation [drug effects]; Bone Density; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*blood, complications]; Dietary Supplements; Fractures, Bone [prevention & control]; Humans; Middle Aged; Osteocalcin [blood]; Osteogenesis [*drug effects]; Protein Precursors [blood]; Prothrombin; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Vitamin K Deficiency [complications, *drug therapy]; Vitamin K [*administration & dosage, blood]; Vitamins [*administration & dosage]",10.1002/14651858.CD008482.pub6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008482.pub6,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,50.0
CD012949.PUB2,"Coffey, MJ; Garg, M; Homaira, N; Jaffe, A; Ooi, CY",Probiotics for people with cystic fibrosis,2020,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem disease and the importance of growth and nutrition has been well established, given its implications for lung function and overall survival. It has been established that intestinal dysbiosis (i.e. microbial imbalance) and inflammation is present in people with CF. Probiotics are commercially available (overâ€theâ€counter) and may improve both intestinal and overall health. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics for improving health outcomes in children and adults with CF. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of last register search: 20 January 2020. We also searched ongoing trials registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 29 January 2019. Selection criteria Randomised or quasiâ€randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing efficacies and safety of probiotics in children and adults with CF. Crossâ€over RCTs with a washout phase were included and for those without a washout period, only the first phase of each trial was analysed. Data collection and analysis We independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included trials; we used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We contacted trial authors for additional data. Metaâ€analyses were undertaken on outcomes at several time points. Main results We identified 17 trials and included 12 RCTs (11 completed and one trial protocol â€ this trial was terminated early) (464 participants). Eight trials included only children, whilst four trials included both children and adults. Trial duration ranged from one to 12 months. Nine trials compared a probiotic (seven single strain and three multistrain preparations) with a placebo preparation, two trials compared a synbiotic (multistrain) with a placebo preparation and one trial compared two probiotic preparations. Overall we judged the risk of bias in the 12 trials to be low. Three trials had a high risk of performance bias, two trials a high risk of attrition bias and six trials a high risk of reporting bias. Only two trials were judged to have low or unclear risk of bias for all domains. Four trials were sponsored by grants only, two trials by industry only, two trials by both grants and industry and three trials had an unknown funding source. Combined data from four trials (225 participants) suggested probiotics may reduce the number of pulmonary exacerbations during a four to 12 month timeâ€frame, mean difference (MD) â€0.32 episodes per participant (95% confidence interval (CI) â€0.68 to 0.03; P = 0.07) (lowâ€certainty evidence); however, the 95% CI includes the possibility of both an increased and a reduced number of exacerbations. Additionally, two trials (127 participants) found no evidence of an effect on the duration of antibiotic therapy during the same time period. Combined data from four trials (177 participants) demonstrated probiotics may reduce faecal calprotectin, MD â€47.4 Âµg/g (95% CI â€93.28 to â€1.54; P = 0.04) (lowâ€certainty evidence), but the results for other biomarkers mainly did not show any difference between probiotics and placebo. Two trials (91 participants) found no evidence of effect on height, weight or body mass index (lowâ€certainty evidence). Combined data from five trials (284 participants) suggested there was no difference in lung function (forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV 1 ) % predicted) during a threeâ€ to 12â€month time frame, MD 1.36% (95% CI â€1.20 to 3.91; P = 0.30) (lowâ€certainty evidence). Combined data from two trials (115 participants) suggested there was no difference in hospitalisation rates during a threeâ€ to 12â€month time frame, MD â€0.44 admissions per participant (95% CI â€1.41 to 0.54; P = 0.38) (lowâ€certainty evidence). One trial (37 participants) reported healthâ€related quality of life and while the parent report favoured probiotics, SMD 0.87 (95% CI 0.19 to 1.55) the child selfâ€report did not identify any effect, SMD 0.59 (95% CI â€0.07 to 1.26) (lowâ€certainty evidence). There were limited results for gastrointestinal symptoms and intestinal microbial profile which were not analysable. Only four trials and one trial protocol (298 participants) reported adverse events as a priori hypotheses. No trials reported any deaths. One terminated trial (12 participants and available as a protocol only) reported a severe allergic reaction (severe urticaria) for one participant in the probiotic group. Two trials reported a single adverse event each (vomiting in one child and diarrhoea in one child). The estimated number needed to harm for any adverse reaction (serious or not) is 52 people (lowâ€certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions Probiotics significantly reduce faecal calprotectin (a marker of intestinal inflammation) in children and adults with CF, however the clinical implications of this require further investigation. Probiotics may make little or no difference to pulmonary exacerbation rates, however, further evidence is required before firm conclusions can be made. Probiotics are associated with a small number of adverse events including vomiting, diarrhoea and allergic reactions. In children and adults with CF, probiotics may be considered by patients and their healthcare providers. Given the variability of probiotic composition and dosage, further adequatelyâ€powered multicentre RCTs of at least 12 months duration are required to best assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics for children and adults with CF. Plain language summary Probiotics for people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence for the use of probiotics in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Cystic fibrosis leads to thick mucus which affects the lungs, gut and other organs. People with cystic fibrosis often have altered gut bacteria and inflammation. Gut inflammation may be linked to growth, with worse inflammation linked to worse growth measures. This is relevant as optimal nutrition and growth is important for lung function and survival in CF. Probiotics are live bacteria which will provide a health benefit to the individual. Probiotics are available overâ€theâ€counter, commonly used by people with cystic fibrosis and may improve gut inflammation and overall health. Search date The evidence is current to: 20 January 2020. Study characteristics The review included 12 randomised controlled trials (11 completed and one trial protocol (plan) â€ this trial was terminated early but reported some results on side effects) with 464 people with cystic fibrosis. Eight trials included only children, whilst four trials included both children and adults. The trials lasted between one and 12 months. Eight trials used a probiotic with a single type of bacteria and four trials used a probiotic with two or more types of bacteria. Only one trial compared different bacteria and the others compared probiotics to a placebo (dummy treatment with no active medication). Key results Probiotics may reduce the rate of pulmonary exacerbations, however, this is not definite; pulmonary exacerbations are events where breathing symptoms are worsened (e.g. increased cough, sputum or shortness of breath) and lung function declines. Probiotics may reduce a marker of gut inflammation called calprotectin, however, the benefit of this to an individual is unknown. There were no differences between probiotics and placebo for height, weight or body mass index (BMI). Results did not show that probiotics affect lung function, need for admission to hospital or abdominal symptoms. One small trial measured quality of life and the parents questionnaire favoured probiotics, but the children's self report did not show a difference between probiotics and placebo. Probiotics may cause vomiting, diarrhoea and allergic reactions. We estimate 52 people need to take probiotics for one person to have an adverse event. We could not analyse the results of the trial comparing different probiotics because of its design. Future trials should look into the use of probiotics for at least 12 months and assess measures of lung and gut health, growth, abdominal symptoms, quality of life and adverse events. Given the wide range or probiotics (single and multiâ€strain combinations), doses used and degree of effectiveness, determining the best regimen(s) to investigate further will be challenging. Certainty of the evidence There were several issues with the overall certainty of the evidence which affects our confidence in the results from these trials. We think the fact that some participants did not complete their treatment or were not included in the reports may affect the results on weight. We think the fact that not all planned outcomes were reported in four trials may affect the results of intestinal inflammation, growth and abdominal symptoms. We think the fact that the pharmaceutical industry sponsored at least four of the trials should be considered when looking at the results of this review. As most trials only included children we are not certain that the results would also apply to adults and there were also some issues related to whether people taking part in the trial knew which treatment they were receiving. We judged the certainty of evidence for changes in pulmonary exacerbations, intestinal inflammation, lung function, hospital admissions, weight and healthâ€related quality of life to be low. Adverse events were only recorded by four trials and the protocol for the terminated trial and the certainty of the evidence was also judged to be low.",1,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Cystic Fibrosis [complications, *microbiology, *therapy]; Humans; Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex [*analysis]; Probiotics [*therapeutic use]; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Treatment Outcome",10.1002/14651858.CD012949.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012949.pub2,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,33.0
CD001912.PUB5,"Rosenfeld, M; Rayner, O; Smyth, AR",Prophylactic antiâ€staphylococcal antibiotics for cystic fibrosis,2020,"Abstract - Background Staphylococcus aureus  causes pulmonary infection in young children with cystic fibrosis. Prophylactic antibiotics are prescribed hoping to prevent such infection and lung damage. Antibiotics have adverse effects and longâ€term use might lead to infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa . This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To assess continuous oral antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent the acquisition of  Staphylococcus aureus  versus no prophylaxis in people with cystic fibrosis, we tested the following hypotheses to investigate whether prophylaxis:â€¨1. improves clinical status, lung function and survival;â€¨2. leads to fewer isolates of  Staphylococcus aureus ;â€¨3. causes adverse effects (e.g. diarrhoea, skin rash, candidiasis);â€¨4. leads to fewer isolates of other common pathogens from respiratory secretions;â€¨5. leads to the emergence of antibiotic resistance and colonisation of the respiratory tract with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Companies manufacturing antiâ€staphylococcal antibiotics were contacted. Most recent search of the Group's Register: 27 February 2020. Online trials registries were also searched. Most recent search of online trials registries: 15 September 2020. Selection criteria Randomised trials of continuous oral prophylactic antibiotics (given for at least one year) compared to intermittent antibiotics given 'as required', in people with cystic fibrosis of any disease severity. Data collection and analysis The authors assessed studies for eligibility and methodological quality and extracted data. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE criteria. The review's primary outcomes of interest were lung function by spirometry (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 )) and the number of people with one or more isolates of  Staphylococcus aureus  (sensitive strains). Main results We included four studies, with a total of 401 randomised participants aged zero to seven years on enrolment; one study is ongoing. The two older included studies generally had a higher risk of bias across all domains, but in particular due to a lack of blinding and incomplete outcome data, than the two more recent studies. We only regarded the most recent study as being generally free of bias, although even here we were not certain of the effect of the per protocol analysis on the study results. Evidence quality was judged to be low for all outcomes assessed after being downgraded based on GRADE assessments. Downgrading decisions were due to limitations in study design (all outcomes), for imprecision and for inconsistency . Prophylactic antiâ€staphylococcal antibiotics probably make little or no difference to lung function measured as FEV 1  % predicted after six years (mean difference (MD) â€2.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) â€13.59 to 8.99, one study, n = 119, lowâ€quality evidence); but may reduce the number of children having one or more isolates of  Staphylococcus aureus  at two years (odds ratio (OR) 0.21, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.35, three studies, n = 315, lowâ€quality evidence). At the same time point, there may be little or no effect on nutrition as reported using weight z score (MD 0.06, 95% CI â€0.33 to 0.45, two studies, n = 140, lowâ€quality evidence), additional courses of antibiotics (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.60, one study, n = 119, lowâ€quality evidence) or adverse effects (lowâ€quality evidence). There was no difference in the number of isolates of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  between groups at two years (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.23, three studies, n = 312, lowâ€quality evidence), though there was a trend towards a lower cumulative isolation rate of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in the prophylaxis group at two and three years and towards a higher rate from four to six years. As the studies reviewed lasted six years or less, conclusions cannot be drawn about the longâ€term effects of prophylaxis. Authors' conclusions Antiâ€staphylococcal antibiotic prophylaxis may lead to fewer children having isolates of  Staphylococcus aureus , when commenced early in infancy and continued up to six years of age. The clinical importance of this finding is uncertain. Further research may establish whether the trend towards more children with CF with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa , after four to six years of prophylaxis, is a chance finding and whether choice of antibiotic or duration of treatment might influence this. Plain language summary Giving antibiotics regularly to people with cystic fibrosis to prevent lung infection with a germ called  Staphylococcus aureus Review question We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and adverse effects of giving regular antibiotics to people with cystic fibrosis to prevent lung infection with a germ called  Staphylococcus aureus . Background Cystic fibrosis blocks the airways with mucus and causes frequent airway infections. Over time, these can lead to lung damage and breathing failure. Most deaths in CF are caused by breathing failure. People with cystic fibrosis are sometimes given regular antibiotics to prevent infections from a germ called  Staphylococcus aureus . However, antibiotics can also have side effects such as oral thrush or diarrhoea and long term use might lead to other more serious kinds of infection. This is an update of a previously published review. Search date The evidence is current to: 27 February 2020. Study characteristics The review includes four studies with 401 children; there were no adult studies. The children were put into groups at random and received either an oral antibiotic continuously as a prevention for at least one year or no antibiotic treatment to prevent infection with  Staphylococcus aureus . All children could be given additional antibiotics if their doctor thought they needed them, based on symptoms and germs grown in their respiratory secretions. Studies lasted for a maximum of six years. Key results The review found some lowâ€quality evidence that giving regular antibiotics to young children (continued up to six years of age) may lead to fewer infections with  Staphylococcus aureus . For other outcomes in the review (weight, need for additional antibiotics, side effects or the number of infections with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa ) there was no difference between giving regular antibiotics or not. Since none of the studies lasted longer than six years, we can't draw any conclusions about longâ€term use. Also, since all studies were in children, we can not comment on the use of these drugs in adults. Future research should seek more fully to address whether this treatment reduces, increases or has no effect on subsequent rates of infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  and look at patterns of antibiotic resistance and survival. A large ongoing study called CFâ€START aims to address these uncertainties. Quality of the evidence Overall, the quality of the evidence was concerning. All the studies were of variable quality and we judged the quality of the evidence to be low for the outcomes we assessed. We judged that the two older studies had a higher risk of bias overall compared to the two newer studies. In particular this was because those taking part in the studies (or their parents or caregivers) would be able to guess which treatment they were receiving, and also one study did not state if anyone had dropped out and if so what the reasons were. Only the newest study seemed to be free of bias, although even here we were not certain if the study results were distorted by the way the data were analysed. Given these concerns, if results from future trials confirm the current findings, it would increase our certainty in our conclusions.",9,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Antibiotic Prophylaxis; *Staphylococcus aureus [isolation & purification]; Bias; Child; Child, Preschool; Cystic Fibrosis [*microbiology]; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Forced Expiratory Volume; Growth; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Pseudomonas aeruginosa [isolation & purification]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Tract Infections [*prevention & control]; Staphylococcal Infections [*prevention & control]",10.1002/14651858.CD001912.pub5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001912.pub5,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,174.0
CD011855.PUB3,"Jaiswal, N; Singh, M; Agarwal, A; Chauhan, A; Jaiswal, N",Palliative drug treatments for breathlessness in cystic fibrosis,2020,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis is a lifeâ€limiting autosomal recessive genetic illness. A feeling of shortness of breath is common in cystic fibrosis, especially as the disease progresses. Reversing the underlying cause is the priority when treating breathlessness (dyspnoea), but when it is not feasible, palliation (easing) becomes the primary goal to improve an individual's quality of life. A range of drugs administered by various routes have been used, but no definite guidelines are available. A systematic review is needed to evaluate such treatments. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of drugs used to ease breathlessness in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of last search: 18 November 2019. We searched databases (clinicaltrials.gov, the ISRCTN registry, the Clinical Trials Registry India and WHO ICTRP) for ongoing trials. These searches were last run on 06 March 2020. Selection criteria We planned to include randomised and quasiâ€randomised controlled trials in people with cystic fibrosis (diagnosed by a positive sweat chloride test or genetic testing) who have breathlessness. We considered studies comparing any drugs used for easing breathlessness to another drug administered by any route (inhaled (nebulised), intravenous, oral, subcutaneous, transmucosal (including buccal, sublingual and intraâ€nasal) and transdermal). Data collection and analysis The authors assessed the search results according to the preâ€defined inclusion criteria. Main results The new searches in 2020 yielded two ongoing studies that were not relevant to the review question. Previous searches had found only one study (crossâ€over in design), which did not fulfil the inclusion criteria as no data were available from the first treatment period alone. Authors' conclusions Due to the lack of available evidence, this review cannot provide any information for clinical practice. The authors call for specific research in this area after taking into account relevant ethical considerations. The research should focus on the efficacy and safety of the drugs with efficacy being measured in terms of improvement in quality of life, dyspnoea scores and hospital stay. Plain language summary Drug treatments to ease breathlessness in cystic fibrosis Review question What is the evidence that drug treatments for breathlessness (also known as dyspnoea) in people with cystic fibrosis are effective and safe? Background Cystic fibrosis is a lifeâ€limiting genetic disease. As the disease progresses, thick sticky mucus is formed in the lungs, pancreas and other organs. This thick mucus increases risk of infection, blocks the airways and causes severe breathlessness. Easing of this breathlessness is an important goal for care of people with cystic fibrosis. Many methods have been suggested to address this problem and many drugs have been reported to ease breathlessness. The drugs can be administered through various routes â€ they might be inhaled, swallowed, injected under the skin, into muscle or into a vein or be absorbed through the skin (either on the body or through membranes inside the mouth or nose). Despite so many drugs being available, there are no defined guidelines for drug treatments aimed at easing breathlessness in people with cystic fibrosis. Search date The evidence from the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register is current to 18 November 2019; the searches of ongoing trial registries are current to 06 March 2020. Study characteristics We had planned to include studies comparing different treatments to ease breathlessness in people with cystic fibrosis where the participants were put into the different treatment groups at random. Our search found only one study in which seven people first received either a drug called hydrocodone or a placebo (dummy treatment) and then swapped to the other treatment; but this study did not report results separately for each treatment arm, so we are not able to include it in the review. Key results No studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, therefore it is not possible to comment on the outcomes we wished to report on in this review. Until evidence becomes available, the review authors feel that it is advisable for doctors to follow any local or national guidelines. The authors recommend research in this area should take ethical considerations into account and should focus on the safety of the drugs, improvement in quality of life, breathlessness scores and length of hospital stay.",4,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Dyspnea [*drug therapy]; Humans; Palliative Care [*methods],10.1002/14651858.CD011855.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011855.pub3,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,6.0
CD006961.PUB5,"Smith, S; Ratjen, F; Remmington, T; Waters, V",Combination antimicrobial susceptibility testing for acute exacerbations in chronic infection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis,2020,"Abstract - Background Antibiotic therapy for acute pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis is usually chosen based on the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing of individual drugs. Combination antimicrobial susceptibility testing assesses the efficacy of drug combinations including two or three antibiotics in vitro and can often demonstrate antimicrobial efficacy against bacterial isolates even when individual antibiotics have little or no effect. Therefore, choosing antibiotics based on combination antimicrobial susceptibility testing could potentially improve response to treatment in people with cystic fibrosis with acute exacerbations. This is an updated version of a previously published review. Objectives To compare antibiotic therapy based on conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing to antibiotic therapy based on combination antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis and chronic infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of latest search: 19 March 2020. We also searched ongoing trials registries. Date of latest search: 07 April 2020. Selection criteria Randomised and quasiâ€randomised controlled studies of antibiotic therapy based on conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing compared to antibiotic therapy based on combination antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis due to chronic infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Data collection and analysis Both authors independently selected studies, assessed their quality and extracted data from eligible studies. Additionally, the authors contacted the study investigators to obtain further information. Main results The search identified one multicentre study eligible for inclusion in the review. This study prospectively assessed whether the use of multiple combination bactericidal antibiotic testing improved clinical outcomes in participants with acute pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis who were infected with multiresistant bacteria. A total of 132 participants were randomised in the study. The study investigators provided data specific to the 82 participants who were only infected with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  for their primary outcome of time until next pulmonary exacerbation. For participants specifically infected with only  Pseudomonas aeruginosa , the hazard ratio of a subsequent exacerbation was 0.82, favouring the control group (95% confidence interval 0.44 to 1.51) (P = 0.52). No further data for any of this review's outcomes specific to participants infected with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  were available. The risk of bias for the included study was deemed to be low. The quality of the evidence was moderate for the only outcome providing data solely for individuals with infection due to  Pseudomonas aeruginosa . For other outcomes, we were unable to judge the quality of the evidence as no data were available for the relevant subset of participants. Authors' conclusions The current evidence, limited to one study, shows that there is insufficient evidence to determine effect of choosing antibiotics based on combination antimicrobial susceptibility testing compared to choosing antibiotics based on conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis with chronic  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  infection. A large international and multicentre study is needed to further investigate this issue. The only study included in the review was published in 2005, and we have not identified any further relevant studies up to March 2017. We therefore do not plan to update this review until new studies are published. Plain language summary Testing antibiotics in combination for acute infections of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in cystic fibrosis Review question We compared the evidence for the effect of testing antibiotics traditionally (one at a time) compared to testing a combination of antibiotics for acute airway infections in people with longâ€term (chronic) infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Background The main cause of death in people with cystic fibrosis is chronic lung infection. People with cystic fibrosis now live longer due to the aggressive use of antibiotics to treat lung infections. Traditionally, antibiotics are chosen based on the results of laboratory testing of each antibiotic separately against the bacterium (or bug) that is found in the lungs of the person with cystic fibrosis. Antibiotics tested in combination may work effectively against a bacterium even if not effective when tested alone. However, when choosing antibiotics to treat lung infections caused by  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in people with cystic fibrosis, it is unclear whether basing the choice of antibiotics on the results of combination testing is better than basing choice on the results of testing antibiotics separately. This is an updated version of a previously published review. Search date The evidence is current to: 19 March 2020. Study characteristics The search identified one study that tried to answer this question and was eligible for inclusion in the review. The study enrolled 132 people with cystic fibrosis, most of whom (82 people) had acute lung infections with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and randomly put them into two treatment groups. In the first group two antibiotics were selected following the testing of combinations of antibiotics and in the second group the two antibiotics were chosen after testing individual antibiotics to see how effective the drugs were against the bacterium. The study was run across several centres and assessed the clinical outcomes in the participants after a 14â€day course of treatment. Key results The study looked at infection with different bacteria and investigators were only able to give us results for just those who were infected with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  for their main outcome (the time until the next acute lung infection). Choosing antibiotics based on the results of combination antibiotic testing did not lead to a longer time until the next lung infection compared to choosing antibiotics based on results of separate testing. They could not provide us with any results for people infected with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  for other outcomes in our review. Quality of the evidence We are satisfied that the people taking part were divided into the different treatment groups completely at random and no one could have foreseen which group any individual would be in. We are also satisfied that during the study, neither the individuals or clinic personnel knew which treatment group each individual was in. There were no data missing from the study. The quality of the evidence for the only outcome for which we have data (time to the next lung infection) is moderate, but we could not judge the quality of the evidence for other outcomes as there were no separate results available for people infected with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa .",5,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Pseudomonas aeruginosa [drug effects]; Anti-Bacterial Agents [*therapeutic use]; Chronic Disease; Cystic Fibrosis [*microbiology]; Disease Progression; Drug Therapy, Combination; Humans; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Pseudomonas Infections [*drug therapy]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",10.1002/14651858.CD006961.pub5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006961.pub5,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,26.0
CD009249.PUB5,"Amin, R; Jahnke, N; Waters, V",Antibiotic treatment for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in people with cystic fibrosis,2020,"Abstract - Background Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  is one of the most common emerging multiâ€drug resistant organisms found in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis and its prevalence is increasing. Chronic infection with  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  has recently been shown to be an independent predictor of pulmonary exacerbation requiring hospitalization and antibiotics. However, the role of antibiotic treatment of  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  infection in people with cystic fibrosis is still unclear. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives The objective of our review is to assess the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment for  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  in people with cystic fibrosis. The primary objective is to assess this in relation to lung function and pulmonary exacerbations in the setting of acute pulmonary exacerbations. The secondary objective is to assess this in relation to the eradication of  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia . Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched a registry of ongoing trials and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of latest search: 03 March 2020. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials of  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  monoâ€infection or  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  coâ€infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in either the setting of an acute pulmonary exacerbation or a chronic infection treated with suppressive antibiotic therapy. Data collection and analysis Both authors independently assessed the trials identified by the search for potential inclusion in the review. Main results We identified only one trial of antibiotic treatment of pulmonary exacerbations that included people with cystic fibrosis with  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia . However, this trial had to be excluded because data was not available per pathogen. Authors' conclusions This review did not identify any evidence regarding the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment for  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  in people with cystic fibrosis. Until such evidence becomes available, clinicians need to use their clinical judgement as to whether or not to treat  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  infection in people with cystic fibrosis. Randomized clinical trials are needed to address these unanswered clinical questions. Plain language summary Antibiotic treatment for  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of antibiotics in people with cystic fibrosis who were infected with  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia . Background Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  is a bacterium which is resistant to several antibiotics and over the last 10 years it has been found more and more often in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis. Longâ€term infection with  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  has been linked to lung infections. However, at present, it is unclear if people with cystic fibrosis should be treated for this lung infection when it is identified. The purpose of this review is to determine whether treatment with different antibiotic combinations for  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  will improve lung function or decrease the frequency of hospital admission in people with cystic fibrosis. We also want to review the effect of treatment of longâ€term  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  infection so as to remove it totally from the lungs of a person with cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published review. Search date The evidence is current to: 03 March 2020. Trial characteristics We did not find any randomized controlled trials (trials where the people taking part are put into different treatment groups completely at random) which we could include in the review. We did find one trial of antibiotic treatment for pulmonary exacerbations (flare up of disease in the airways) which included people infected with  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia , but the people in the trial also had infections caused by other bacteria and we were not able to obtain separate data for the different causes of infection. Key results Randomized controlled trials are needed to inform clinicians as to whether they should treat  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  infection in people with cystic fibrosis. In the meantime, clinicians should use their clinical judgement when considering this question.",3,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; Anti-Bacterial Agents [*therapeutic use]; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications, microbiology]; Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections [*drug therapy, microbiology]; Humans; Respiratory Tract Infections [*drug therapy, microbiology]",10.1002/14651858.CD009249.pub5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009249.pub5,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,63.0
CD008649.PUB4,"Nevitt, SJ; Thornton, J; Murray, CS; Dwyer, T",Inhaled mannitol for cystic fibrosis,2020,"Abstract - Background Several agents are used to clear secretions from the airways of people with cystic fibrosis. Mannitol increases mucociliary clearance, but its exact mechanism of action is unknown. The dry powder formulation of mannitol may be more convenient and easier to use compared with established agents which require delivery via a nebuliser. Phase III trials of inhaled dry powder mannitol for the treatment of cystic fibrosis have been completed and it is now available in Australia and some countries in Europe. This is an update of a previous review. Objectives To assess whether inhaled dry powder mannitol is well tolerated, whether it improves the quality of life and respiratory function in people with cystic fibrosis and which adverse events are associated with the treatment. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic databases, handsearching relevant journals and abstracts from conferences. Date of last search: 12 December 2019. Selection criteria All randomised controlled studies comparing mannitol with placebo, active inhaled comparators (for example, hypertonic saline or dornase alfa) or with no treatment. Data collection and analysis Authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, carried out data extraction and assessed the risk of bias in included studies. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Main results Six studies (reported in 36 unique publications) were included with a total of 784 participants. Duration of treatment in the included studies ranged from 12 days to six months, with openâ€label treatment for an additional six months in two of the studies. Five studies compared mannitol with control (a very low dose of mannitol or nonâ€respirable mannitol) and the final study compared mannitol to dornase alfa alone and to mannitol plus dornase alfa. Two large studies had a similar parallel design and provided data for 600 participants, which could be pooled where data for a particular outcome and time point were available. The remaining studies had much smaller sample sizes (ranging from 22 to 95) and data could not be pooled due to differences in design, interventions and population. Pooled evidence from the two large parallel studies was judged to be of low to moderate quality and from the smaller studies was judged to be of low to very low quality. In all studies, there was an initial test to see if participants tolerated mannitol, with only those who could tolerate the drug being randomised; therefore, the study results are not applicable to the cystic fibrosis population as a whole. While the published papers did not provide all the data required for our analysis, additional unpublished data were provided by the drug's manufacturer and the author of one of the studies. Pooling the large parallel studies comparing mannitol to control, up to and including six months, lung function (forced expiratory volume at one second) measured in both mL and % predicted was significantly improved in the mannitol group compared to the control group (moderateâ€quality evidence). Beneficial results were observed in these studies in adults and in both concomitant dornase alfa users and nonâ€users in these studies. In the smaller studies, statistically significant improvements in lung function were also observed in the mannitol groups compared to the nonâ€respirable mannitol groups; however, we judged this evidence to be of low to very low quality. For the comparisons of mannitol and control, we found no consistent differences in healthâ€related quality of life in any of the domains except for burden of treatment, which was less for mannitol up to four months in the two pooled studies of a similar design; this difference was not maintained at six months. It should be noted that the tool used to measure healthâ€related quality of life was not designed to assess mucolytics and pooling of the ageâ€appropriate tools (as done in some of the included studies) may not be valid so results were judged to be low to very low quality and should be interpreted with caution. Cough, haemoptysis, bronchospasm, pharyngolaryngeal pain and postâ€tussive vomiting were the most commonly reported side effects in both treatment groups. Where rates of adverse events could be compared, statistically no significant differences were found between mannitol and control groups; although some of these events may have clinical relevance for people with CF. For the comparisons of mannitol to dornase alfa alone and to mannitol plus dornase alfa, very lowâ€quality evidence from a 12â€week crossâ€over study of 28 participants showed no statistically significant differences in the recorded domains of healthâ€related quality of life or measures of lung function. Cough was the most common side effect in the mannitol alone arm but there was no occurrence of cough in the dornase alfa alone arm and the most commonly reported reason of withdrawal from the mannitol plus dornase alfa arm was pulmonary exacerbations. In terms of secondary outcomes of the review (pulmonary exacerbations, hospitalisations, symptoms, sputum microbiology), evidence provided by the included studies was more limited. For all comparisons, no consistent statistically significant and clinically meaningful differences were observed between mannitol and control treatments (including dornase alfa). Authors' conclusions There is moderateâ€quality evidence to show that treatment with mannitol over a sixâ€month period is associated with an improvement in some measures of lung function in people with cystic fibrosis compared to control. There is low to very lowâ€quality evidence suggesting no difference in quality of life for participants taking mannitol compared to control. This review provides very lowâ€quality evidence suggesting no difference in lung function or quality of life comparing mannitol to dornase alfa alone and to mannitol plus dornase alfa. The clinical implications from this review suggest that mannitol could be considered as a treatment in cystic fibrosis; but further research is required in order to establish who may benefit most and whether this benefit is sustained in the longer term. Furthermore, studies comparing its efficacy against other (established) mucolytic therapies need to be undertaken before it can be considered for mainstream practice. Plain language summary Mannitol, an inhaled drug, for treating lung disease in cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of inhaling mannitol to treat lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that affects the exocrine glands (sweat glands and others). Lung infections produce thick mucus (phlegm) which can block air passages and cause more infection and repeated inflammation. In turn, this progressively damages the lungs and can eventually cause respiratory failure. There are several drugs that are used to clear mucus from the airways of people with cystic fibrosis and inhaled dry powder mannitol is a new one that may improve their lung function. The dry powder formulation of mannitol may be more convenient and easier to use compared with established agents delivered by a nebuliser (e.g. hypertonic saline). Mannitol is available in Australia and some European countries. This is an updated version of the review. Search date The evidence is current to: 12 December 2019. Study characteristics We included six studies (with a total of 784 adults and children) in this review. Five studies compared a standard dose of mannitol with control (a very low dose of mannitol or a version of mannitol which did not allow the active drug to reach the lungs) and the sixth study compared mannitol with nebulised recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (dornase alfa), both alone and taken together. Participants could continue using dornase alfa and other standard therapies, but were excluded from the five of the six studies if they were using hypertonic saline. Treatment in these studies lasted from 12 days to six months. Five studies provided the treatments to people as outpatients and in one study, the children treated were in hospital due to pulmonary exacerbations (flare ups of disease). Key results It was difficult to combine evidence from the studies in this review due to differences in the designs of the studies, treatments examined and the settings (hospital or outpatients). Some additional information was obtained from the drug manufacturer and one study author to aid the review. The review found lowâ€ to very lowâ€quality evidence that there is no difference between mannitol and control treatments or mannitol given either with or without additional dornase alfa in terms of quality of life. There was moderateâ€quality evidence of improvements in some measures of lung function across the larger studies comparing mannitol to control. Beneficial effects were also seen in the subgroup of adults and in both those who were using dornase alfa and those who were not. Cough (including coughing up blood), contraction of the airways, pain in the pharynx or larynx and postâ€treatment vomiting were the most commonly reported side effects on both treatments, but there was no evidence to suggest that these side effects occurred more on mannitol than on control treatments or on dornase alfa. None of the studies compared mannitol to nebulised hypertonic saline and so we can not comment on which agent is better for airway clearance. More research is needed to answer this question. Quality of the evidence We judged the quality of the evidence from this review to be of very low to moderate quality, depending on the outcome measured. We do not think that the way the studies were designed affected the results. We judged that everyone taking part had equal chances of being in either of the treatment groups and would not have known in advance or during the study which treatment they were receiving. However, the numbers of people who dropped out of the studies might affect how the results are interpreted, as well as how many people were recruited into the studies and how they were selected from all people with cystic fibrosis who could have been included. Although some of these issues were resolved when the drug's manufacturer (who also sponsored the studies) provided some additional information. It is important to realise that before people started the study, they took a test to see if they could tolerate mannitol and only those who did could carry on. This means that the results of the studies only apply to those people with cystic fibrosis who can tolerate mannitol.",5,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Administration, Inhalation; Adult; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*drug therapy, physiopathology]; Deoxyribonuclease I [*administration & dosage]; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Mannitol [*administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Mucociliary Clearance; Powders; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Recombinant Proteins [administration & dosage]; Respiratory Function Tests; Vital Capacity",10.1002/14651858.CD008649.pub4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008649.pub4,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,69.0
CD009422.PUB4,"Okebukola, PO; Kansra, S; Barrett, J",Vitamin E supplementation in people with cystic fibrosis,2020,"Abstract - Background People with cystic fibrosis are at an increased risk of fatâ€soluble vitamin deficiency, including vitamin E. Vitamin E deficiency can cause a host of conditions such as haemolytic anaemia, cerebellar ataxia and cognitive difficulties. Vitamin E supplementation is widely recommended for people with cystic fibrosis and aims to ameliorate this deficiency. This is an updated version of the review. Objectives To determine the effects of any level of vitamin E supplementation on the frequency of vitamin E deficiency disorders in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register and also searched international online trial registries for any ongoing clinical trials that were not identified during our register search. Date of last search of the Register: 11 August 2020.â€¨Date of last search of international online trial registries: 20 July 2020. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials and quasiâ€randomised controlled trials comparing any preparation of vitamin E supplementation to placebo or no supplement, regardless of dosage or duration. Data collection and analysis Two authors extracted outcome data from each study (published information) and assessed the risk of bias of each included study. They assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. Main results Four studies with a total of 141 participants were included in the review, two of these were in children (aged six months to 14.5 years), and two did not specify participantsâ€™ age. All studies used different formulations and doses of vitamin E for various durations of treatment (10 days to six months). Two studies compared the supplementation of fatâ€soluble as well as waterâ€soluble formulations to no supplementation in different arms of the same study. A third study compared a waterâ€soluble formulation to a placebo; and in the fourth study a fatâ€soluble formulation of vitamin E was assessed against placebo. There was limited detail about randomisation and blinding in the included studies which compromises the quality of the evidence base for the review. The heterogeneous mix of the formulations with differing biovailabilities among these studies also limits the generalisability of the data to the wider cystic fibrosis population. None of the studies in either comparison report the review's primary outcomes of vitamin E total lipid ratio or the incidence of vitamin Eâ€specific deficiency disorders, or the secondary outcomes lung function or quality of life. Waterâ€soluble vitamin E Waterâ€soluble vitamin E may improve serum vitamin E levels compared with control at six months, one study (45 participants), mean difference (MD) 19.74 umol/L (95% confidence interval (CI) 13.48 to 26.00) (lowâ€quality evidence). Similar results were also seen at one month, two studies (32 participants), MD 17.66 umol/L (95% CI 10.59 to 24.74) and at three months, one study (45 participants), MD 11.61 umol/L (95% CI 4.77 to 18.45). Only one study (45 participants) reported weight (secondary outcome of growth and nutritional status) at one and six months, but showed no difference between treatment and control at either time point. Fatâ€soluble vitamin E Two studies (36 participants) reported higher levels of serum vitamin E at one month with fatâ€soluble vitamin E compared with control, MD 13.59 umol/L (95% CI 9.52 to 17.66); however, at three months one study (36 participants) showed no difference between treatment and control. No studies in this comparison reported on growth or nutritional status. Authors' conclusions Vitamin E supplementation may lead to an improvement in vitamin E levels in people with cystic fibrosis, although evidence we assessed was low quality. No data on other outcomes of interest were available to allow conclusions about any other benefits of this therapy. In future, larger studies are needed, especially in people already being treated with entericâ€coated pancreatic enzymes and supplemented with vitamin E, to look at more specific outcome measures such as vitamin E status, lung function and nutritional status. Future studies could also look at the optimal dose of vitamin E required to achieve maximal clinical effectiveness. Plain language summary Vitamin E supplementation in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We wanted to know what effects, if any, vitamin E supplementation (at any dose) has on how often people with cystic fibrosis have health problems due to vitamin E deficiency. Background Approximately 85% to 90% of people with cystic fibrosis do not produce enough enzymes in their pancreas and are not able to absorb fat when digesting food; they are also likely to have problems absorbing the fatâ€soluble vitamins A, D, E and K. If levels of vitamin E are too low, this may cause blood disorders and problems with the nervous system, with memory and with thinking skills. Search date We last searched for evidence on 20 July 2020. Study characteristics We identified four studies including 141 participants; two of these were in children (aged six months to 14.5 years) and two did not specify the age of the participants. Those taking part in the studies received different forms of vitamin E supplements (either waterâ€soluble or fatâ€soluble), placebo (a substance containing no medication) or no supplements. Three studies stated that the treatment for each person was chosen at random, but one study only said the people were split into different groups. Key results Waterâ€soluble vitamin E Evidence from one study (45 participants) showed that supplementation may increase vitamin E levels in the blood after six months. Similar results were seen at the earlier time points of one month (two studies, 32 participants) and three three months (one study, 45 participants). Only one study (45 participants) reported weight at one and six months, but showed no difference between supplementation and placebo at either time point. Fatâ€soluble vitamin E Two studies (36 participants) reported higher levels of serum vitamin E after one month of fatâ€soluble vitamin E supplements compared with no treatment, but a different study (36 participants) did not find any difference between supplementation and no treatment after three months. None of the studies in either comparison reported results for our planned outcomes of vitamin E total lipid ratio, the incidence of vitamin Eâ€specific deficiency disorders, lung function or quality of life. As the studies used different forms of supplements and different doses, it was difficult to combine the results and apply them to the wider cystic fibrosis population. The results showed that vitamin E supplementation may lead to an improvement in vitamin E levels in people with cystic fibrosis, but the quality of the evidence was low. Future studies should look at more specific outcomes such as vitamin E status, lung function and nutritional status, especially in people already receiving treatment with pancreatic enzymes and vitamin E supplements. They could also look at the best level of vitamin E supplements needed to be most clinically effective. Quality of the evidence We judged the evidence to be low quality for the following reasons. We do not think that any of the people taking part in the studies could tell whether they received the supplements or the placebo, so that would not have affected the results; although they would have known if they were taking supplements or not taking anything. We could not tell from the information we have whether most of the studies were designed so all people had an equal chance of being in any of the groups. We also could not tell if anyone would have been able to guess in advance which group they would be in. It was also not clear if there were results reported for everyone taking part in the studies and the reasons why anyone might have dropped out of the studies. We do not know if these facts will affect our confidence in the results.",9,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Dietary Supplements; Adolescent; Adult; Bias; Child; Child, Preschool; Cystic Fibrosis [*blood]; Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency [complications]; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Placebos [administration & dosage]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Vitamin E Deficiency [prevention & control]; Vitamin E [*administration & dosage, blood, chemistry]; Vitamins [*administration & dosage, chemistry]; alpha-Tocopherol [administration & dosage]",10.1002/14651858.CD009422.pub4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009422.pub4,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,40.0
CD002007.PUB5,"Holland, P; Jahnke, N",Single versus combination intravenous antiâ€pseudomonal antibiotic therapy for people with cystic fibrosis,2021,"Abstract - Background The choice of antibiotic, and the use of single or combined therapy are controversial areas in the treatment of respiratory infection due to  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in cystic fibrosis (CF). Advantages of combination therapy include wider range of modes of action, possible synergy and reduction of resistant organisms; advantages of monotherapy include lower cost, ease of administration and reduction of drugâ€related toxicity. Current evidence does not provide a clear answer and the use of intravenous antibiotic therapy in CF requires further evaluation. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of single compared to combination intravenous antiâ€pseudomonal antibiotic therapy for treating people with CF. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Most recent search of the Group's Trials Register: 07 October 2020. We also searched online trials registries on 16 November 2020. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a single intravenous antiâ€pseudomonal antibiotic with a combination of that antibiotic plus a second antiâ€pseudomonal antibiotic in people with CF. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We assessed the certainty of the data using GRADE. Main results We identified 59 trials, of which we included eight trials (356 participants) comparing a single antiâ€pseudomonal agent to a combination of the same antibiotic and one other. There was a wide variation in the individual antibiotics used in each trial. In total, the trials included seven comparisons of a betaâ€lactam antibiotic (penicillinâ€related or third generation cephalosporin) with a betaâ€lactamâ€aminoglycoside combination and three comparisons of an aminoglycoside with a betaâ€lactamâ€aminoglycoside combination.  There was considerable heterogeneity amongst these trials, leading to difficulties in performing the review and interpreting the results. These results should be interpreted cautiously. Six of the included trials were published between 1977 and 1988; these were singleâ€centre trials with flaws in the randomisation process and small sample size. Overall, the methodological quality was poor and the certainty of the evidence ranged from low to moderate. The review did not find any differences between monotherapy and combination therapy in either the short term or in the long term for the outcomes of different lung function measures, bacteriological outcome measures, need for additional treatment, adverse effects, quality of life or symptom scores. Authors' conclusions The results of this review are inconclusive. The review raises important methodological issues. There is a need for an RCT which needs to be wellâ€designed in terms of adequate randomisation allocation, blinding, power and longâ€term followâ€up. Results need to be standardised to a consistent method of reporting, in order to validate the pooling of results from multiple trials. Plain language summary A comparison of single and combined intravenous drug therapy for people with cystic fibrosis infected with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa Review question We reviewed the evidence about the different effects of using a single intravenous (given directly into a vein) antibiotic compared to using a combination of intravenous antibiotics in people with cystic fibrosis infected with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Background Cystic fibrosis is a serious genetic disease that affects cells in the exocrine glands (sweat glands and others). People with cystic fibrosis have a greater risk of chronic lung infections, often due to bacteria called  Pseudomonas aeruginosa . They receive antibiotics, either a single drug or a combination of different drugs, given into a vein to treat these infections. Both the choice of antibiotic and the use of single or combined therapy vary. We looked for randomised controlled trials which compared a single intravenous antibiotic with a combination of that antibiotic plus another one in people with cystic fibrosis. This is an updated version of the review. Search date The evidence is current to: 07 October 2020. Study characteristics We included eight trials with a total of 356 people. Six of these were published before 1988, were each based in a single centre and used a range of different drugs. These factors made it difficult to combine and analyse the results. Key results We did not find any differences between the two therapies for lung function, bacteriological outcomes, side effects or symptom scores. We do not think that there is enough evidence to compare the different therapies properly. More research is needed, particularly looking at side effects of treatment. Quality of the evidence We judged the certainty of the evidence to be low to moderate. Six of the included trials were quite old (published between 1977 and 1988). They did not include many people and had flaws in the way the people taking part were put into the different treatment groups. Overall, the quality of the trials' design was poor.",6,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Adult; Aminoglycosides [administration & dosage]; Anti-Bacterial Agents [*administration & dosage]; Bacterial Infections [*drug therapy]; Cephalosporins [administration & dosage]; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Drug Therapy, Combination [methods]; Humans; Injections, Intravenous; Pseudomonas Infections [*drug therapy]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Tract Infections [*drug therapy]; beta-Lactams [administration & dosage]",10.1002/14651858.CD002007.pub5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002007.pub5,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,76.0
CD013079.PUB3,"Frost, F; Shaw, M; Nazareth, D",Antibiotic therapy for chronic infection with Burkholderia cepacia complex in people with cystic fibrosis,2021,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) a lifeâ€limiting inherited disease affecting a number of organs, but classically associated with chronic lung infection and progressive loss of lung function. Chronic infection by  Burkholderia cepacia  complex (BCC) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and therefore represents a significant challenge to clinicians treating people with CF. This review examines the current evidence for longâ€term antibiotic therapy in people with CF and chronic BCC infection. Objectives The objective of this review is to assess the effects of longâ€term oral and inhaled antibiotic therapy targeted against chronic BCC lung infections in people with CF. The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of treatments in terms of improvements in lung function and reductions in exacerbation rate. Secondary objectives include quantifying adverse events, mortality and changes in quality of life associated with treatment. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched online trial registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 12 April 2021. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of longâ€term antibiotic therapy in people with CF and chronic BCC infection. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias and assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. Main results We included one RCT (100 participants) which lasted 52 weeks comparing continuous inhaled aztreonam lysine (AZLI) and placebo in a doubleâ€blind RCT for 24 weeks, followed by a 24â€week openâ€label extension and a fourâ€week followâ€up period. The average participant age was 26.3 years, 61% were male and average lung function was 56.5% predicted. Treatment with AZLI for 24 weeks was not associated with improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ), mean difference 0.91% (95% confidence interval (CI) â€3.15 to 4.97) (moderateâ€quality evidence). The median time to the next exacerbation was 75 days in the AZLI group compared to 51 days in the placebo group, but the difference was not significant (P = 0.27) (moderateâ€quality evidence). Similarly, the number of participants hospitalised for respiratory exacerbations showed no difference between groups, risk ratio (RR) 0.88 (95% CI 0.53 to 1.45) (moderateâ€quality evidence). Overall adverse events were similar between groups, RR 1.08 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.19) (moderateâ€quality evidence). There were no significant differences between treatment groups in relation to mortality (moderateâ€quality evidence), quality of life or sputum density. In relation to methodological quality, the overall risk of bias in the study was assessed to be unclear to low risk. Authors' conclusions We found insufficient evidence from the literature to determine an effective strategy for antibiotic therapy for treating chronic BCC infection. Plain language summary Antibiotic treatments for longâ€term  Burkholderia cepacia  infections in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence for longâ€term antibiotic treatments for people with cystic fibrosis who are infected with  Burkholderia cepacia  complex (bacteria composed of at least 20 different species). Background People with cystic fibrosis often suffer from repeated chest infections and eventually their lungs become permanently infected by bacteria, such as a family of bacteria called  Burkholderia cepacia  complex which can cause problems because many antibiotics do not work against them and they can cause a quicker deterioration in lung disease. We wanted to discover whether using longâ€term antibiotic treatment was beneficial for people with cystic fibrosis and  Burkholderia cepacia  complex infection. Search date The evidence is current to: 12 April 2021. Study characteristics This review included one study of 100 people aged between 6 and 57 years old. The study compared an inhaled antibiotic called aztreonam to placebo (a substance which contains no medication) and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly (by chance). The study lasted 52 weeks. Key results The only study included in this review found inhaled aztreonam had no beneficial effect on lung function or rates of chest infections in people with cystic fibrosis and  Burkholderia cepacia  complex infection. There was no difference between groups in relation to the average time to the next exacerbation or the number of people hospitalised for an exacerbation. Overall adverse events were similar between groups and with regards to other outcomes assessed, there was no difference between treatment groups for mortality, quality of life or sputum density. More research is needed to establish if other inhaled antibiotics may be useful. Quality of the evidence Overall quality of evidence was considered to be moderate across all outcomes, which means further research is likely to have an important impact on results.",12,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Burkholderia cepacia; *Cystic Fibrosis [complications, drug therapy]; Adult; Anti-Bacterial Agents [adverse effects]; Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator; Humans; Male; Persistent Infection; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",10.1002/14651858.CD013079.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013079.pub3,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,17.0
CD010288.PUB5,"Jat, KR; Walia, DK; Khairwa, A",Antiâ€IgE therapy for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis,2021,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive multisystem disorder with an approximate prevalence of 1 in 3500 live births. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a lung disease caused by aspergillusâ€induced hypersensitivity with a prevalence of 2% to 15% in people with cystic fibrosis. The mainstay of treatment includes corticosteroids and itraconazole. The treatment with corticosteroids for prolonged periods of time, or repeatedly for exacerbations of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, may lead to many adverse effects. The monoclonal antiâ€IgE antibody, omalizumab, has improved asthma control in severely allergic asthmatics. The drug is given as a subcutaneous injection every two to four weeks. Since allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is also a condition resulting from hypersensitivity to specific allergens, as in asthma, it may be a candidate for therapy using antiâ€IgE antibodies. Therefore, antiâ€IgE therapy, using agents like omalizumab, may be a potential therapy for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis. This is an updated version of the review. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and adverse effects of antiâ€IgE therapy for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Last search: 09 September 2021. We searched two ongoing trial registries (Clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO trials platform). Date of latest search: 16 August 2021. Selection criteria Randomized and quasiâ€randomized controlled trials comparing antiâ€IgE therapy to placebo or other therapies for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the included study. They planned to perform data analysis using Review Manager. Main results Only one study enrolling 14 participants was eligible for inclusion in the review. The doubleâ€blind study compared a daily dose of 600 mg omalizumab or placebo along with twice daily itraconazole and oral corticosteroids, with a maximum daily dose of 400 mg. Treatment lasted six months but the study was terminated prematurely and complete data were not available. We contacted the study investigator and were told that the study was terminated due to the inability to recruit participants into the study despite all reasonable attempts. One or more serious side effects were encountered in six out of nine (66.67%) and one out of five (20%) participants in omalizumab group and placebo group respectively. Authors' conclusions There is lack of evidence for the efficacy and safety of antiâ€IgE (omalizumab) therapy in people with cystic fibrosis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. There is a need for large prospective randomized controlled studies of antiâ€IgE therapy in people with cystic fibrosis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis with both clinical and laboratory outcome measures such as steroid requirement, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis exacerbations and lung function. Plain language summary Use of antiâ€IgE treatment for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of antiâ€IgE therapy for treating allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Cystic fibrosis is a genetically inherited disease which is not uncommon in the Western World. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a lung disease caused by extreme sensitivity to aspergillus (a fungus) and may occur in 2% to 15% of people with cystic fibrosis. Corticosteroids and antifungal therapy are the mainstay of treatment for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, but lengthy or repeated use of corticosteroids may lead to serious side effects. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis occurs as a result of the action of IgE antibodies (a type of protein). A drug that acts against these IgE antibodies (antiâ€IgE therapy), such as omalizumab, may be a possible treatment for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis. The drug is given as an injection below the skin every two to four weeks. The review aimed to show whether antiâ€IgE therapy for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis is effective and to highlight any possible side effects. Search date The evidence is current to: 09 September 2021. Study characteristics We could only include one small study in the review (14 participants) and this was stopped early because not enough people agreed to join the study as volunteers. The study lasted six months and compared omalizumab (XolairÂ®) injections under the skin of the upper arm or the thigh to placebo injections (dummy treatment containing no active medication). Volunteers were given of 600 mg of omalizumab or placebo daily along with itraconazole (an antifungal drug) twice daily and oral corticosteroids, with a maximum daily dose of 400 mg. Key results The full results of the study were not published. Only limited results on side effects were published online. Six out of nine volunteers (66.67%) in the omalizumab group and one out of five volunteers (20%) in the placebo group reported one or more serious side effects. Due to the lack of evidence, we are not able to make recommendations either in favour of, or against the use of, antiâ€IgE (omalizumab) therapy in people with cystic fibrosis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. More research into this treatment is needed.",9,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Aspergillosis, Allergic Bronchopulmonary [drug therapy]; *Cystic Fibrosis [complications, drug therapy]; Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic; Antifungal Agents [therapeutic use]; Humans; Prospective Studies; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",10.1002/14651858.CD010288.pub5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010288.pub5,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,20.0
CD013755.PUB2,"Toner, A; McCloy, A; Dyce, P; Nazareth, D; Frost, F",Continuous glucose monitoring systems for monitoring cystic fibrosisâ€related diabetes,2021,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common lifeâ€shortening autosomalâ€recessive genetic conditions with around 100,000 people affected globally. CF mainly affects the respiratory system, but cystic fibrosisâ€related diabetes (CFRD) is a common extrapulmonary coâ€morbidity and causes excess morbidity and mortality in this population. Continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS) are a relatively new technology and, as yet, the impact of these on the monitoring and subsequent management of CFRD remains undetermined. Objectives To establish the impact of insulin therapy guided by continuous glucose monitoring compared to insulin therapy guided by other forms of glucose data collection on the lives of people with CFRD. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of latest search: 23 September 2021. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews and online trials registries. Date of last search: 23 September 2021. Selection criteria Randomised controlled studies comparing insulin regimens led by data from CGMS (including realâ€time or retrospective data, or both) with insulin regimens guided by abnormal blood glucose measurements collected through other means of glycaemic data collection in people with CFRD. Studies with a crossâ€over design, even with a washout period between intervention arms, are not eligible for inclusion due to the potential longâ€term impact of each of the interventions and the potential to compromise the outcomes of the second intervention. Data collection and analysis No studies were included in the review, meaning that no data were available to be collected for analysis. Main results Review authors screened 14 studies at the fullâ€text stage against the review's inclusion criteria. Consequently, seven were excluded due to the study type being ineligible (not randomised), two studies were excluded due to their crossâ€over design, and two studies was excluded since the intervention used was not eligible and one was a literature review. One study in participants hospitalised for a pulmonary exacerbation is ongoing. Investigators are comparing insulin dosing via insulin pump with blood sugar monitoring by a CGMS to conventional diabetes management with daily insulin injections (or on an insulin pump if already on an insulin pump in the outpatient setting) and capillary blood glucose monitoring. The participants in the control arm will wear a blinded continuous glucose monitoring system for outcome assessment. In addition to this, one further study is still awaiting classification, and will be screened to determine whether it is eligible for inclusion, or is to be excluded, in an update of this review. Authors' conclusions No studies were included in the review, indicating that there is currently insufficient evidence to determine the impact of insulin therapy guided by CGMS compared to insulin therapy guided by other forms of glucose data collection on the lives of people with CFRD, nor on potential adverse effects of continuous glucose monitoring in this context. Randomised controlled studies are needed to generate evidence on the efficacy and safety of continuous glucose monitoring in people with CFRD. There is one relevant ongoing study that may be eligible for inclusion in a future update of this Cochrane Review, and whose results may help answer the review question. Plain language summary Continuous glucose monitoring systems for monitoring cystic fibrosisâ€related diabetes Review question Canusing continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS) help people with cystic fibrosisâ€related diabetes (CFRD) manage their condition better? Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lifeâ€shortening genetic condition. Many people with CF also develop CFRD, where their blood glucose, or the amount of sugar in their blood, can rise to harmful levels. People with CFRD seem to experience more frequent chest infections and a shorter life expectancy than people with CF who do not have diabetes. CFRD can be managed with injections of insulin to help keep blood sugar in the normal range. To do this safely, people with CFRD need to routinely check blood sugar levels to make sure that they are taking the right amount of insulin. They usually do this by pricking their fingers and measuring a drop of blood on a machine. CGMS are devices that can be worn by a person and which closely estimate blood sugar levels without the need for regular pinâ€prick testing. They are a relatively new technology and we still do not know how they affect the monitoring and management of CFRD. We wanted to find out whether using CGMS was better or worse than other methods, such as using the traditional 'finger stick' method, for monitoring blood sugar levels inpeople with CFRD. The main outcomes we wanted to look at were quality of life, any problems the CGMS might cause, and the amount of time a person's blood sugar stayed in the normal range. We decided that theseoutcomes were most important afterasking people with CFRD and their families what mattered most to them. Search date Evidence is current to: 23 September 2021. Study characteristics We did not find any relevant studies to include in the review, but we found two studies which we might be able to include in an update of this review when we have more information about them and they have both been completed. Key results When we ran our searches, we did not find any studies that matched our inclusion criteria. This means we cannot comment on how CGMS affects the outcomes we set out to investigate as there is no evidence for us to look at. We found one ongoing study in people with CFRD who are in hospital for a pulmonary exacerbation (flare up of chest symptoms). The study is comparing the effects of giving insulin via an insulin pump and monitoring blood sugar using a CGMS to giving daily insulin injections (or if participants are already using an insulin pump before being admitted to hospital, they continue with this) and monitoring blood sugar levels using the 'finger stick' method. The people using the finger stick method will wear a dummy CGMS so the clinicians measuring outcomes will not know which group they are in. The study has not yet been completed, so we could not include it, but we might be able to include it in a future version of this review.  More research is needed on this topic to help fill the gap in the evidence which we have identified in this review.",11,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,*Cystic Fibrosis [complications]; *Diabetes Mellitus; Blood Glucose; Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring; Humans; Retrospective Studies,10.1002/14651858.CD013755.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013755.pub2,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,2.0
CD012798.PUB3,"Gilchrist, FJ; Green, J; Carroll, W",Interventions for treating distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) in cystic fibrosis,2021,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis is the most common lifeâ€limiting autosomal recessive genetic disorder in white populations. Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) is an important morbidity in cystic fibrosis. It is the result of the accumulation of viscid faecal material within the bowel which combines with thick, sticky mucus produced in the intestines of people with cystic fibrosis. The intestine may be completely blocked (complete DIOS) or only partially blocked (incomplete DIOS). Once a diagnosis of DIOS has been made, the goal of therapy is to relieve the acute complete or incomplete faecal obstruction and ultimately prevent the need for surgical intervention . Objectives This review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different treatment regimens for the treatment of DIOS (complete and incomplete) in children and adults with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of search: 09 September 2021. We also searched online trial registries. Date of last search: 12 October 2021. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials, quasiâ€randomised controlled trials (including crossâ€over trials (to be judged on an individual basis)) comparing the use of laxative agents or surgery for treating DIOS in children, young people and adults with cystic fibrosis to each other, placebo or no intervention. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened papers, extracted trial details and assessed for risk of bias. The authors assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE. Main results There was one trial with 20 participants (16 females) included in the review. The mean age of participants was 13.1 years. The trial was a doubleâ€blinded, randomised crossâ€over trial which had a duration of 12 months in total and compared highâ€dose and lowâ€dose pancreatic enzyme therapy. As only the abstract of the trial was available, the overall risk of bias was judged to be unclear. The trial did not address either of our primary outcomes (time until resolution of DIOS and treatment failure rate), but reported episodes of acute DIOS, presence of abdominal mass and abdominal pain. There were no numerical data available for these outcomes, but the authors stated that there was no difference between treatment with highâ€dose or lowâ€dose pancreatic enzymes. The overall certainty of the evidence was found to be very low. Authors' conclusions There is a clear lack of evidence for the treatment of DIOS in people with cystic fibrosis. The included abstract did not address our primary outcome measures and did not provide numerical data for the two secondary outcomes it did address. Therefore, we cannot justify the use of highâ€dose pancreatic enzymes for treating DIOS, nor can we comment on the efficacy and safety of other laxative agents. From our findings, it is clear that more randomised controlled trials need to be conducted in this area. Plain language summary Interventions for treating distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) in cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of different treatments for distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) in children and adults with cystic fibrosis. Background Cystic fibrosis is a common, lifeâ€limiting, inherited disease. One of the main features of cystic fibrosis is the thick, sticky mucus produced by many organs including the lungs, pancreas and intestine. DIOS occurs when mucus in the intestine combines with faeces and builds up to produce a mass. This mass can partially or completely block the intestine and cause symptoms such as vomiting, severe abdominal pain and a swollen stomach (abdominal distension). Once a diagnosis of DIOS has been made, the goal of therapy is to relieve the complete or partial blockage and ultimately prevent the need for any surgical intervention. Search date The evidence is current to: 12 October 2021. Trial characteristics The review included one trial with 20 people with cystic fibrosis who were aged between 7.1 and 23.2 years of age (average 13.1 years old). The 12â€month trial compared a high dose of pancreatic enzymes with a low dose of pancreatic enzymes for treating chronic DIOS. Key results The trial did not report on our primary outcomes (time until DIOS successfully treated and treatment failure rate), but addressed two of our secondary outcomes; episodes of acute DIOS and the harmful effects that might occur in participants (the presence of an abdominal mass and abdominal pain). There were no numerical data available for these results, but the authors reported that there was no difference between highâ€dose or lowâ€dose pancreatic enzymes. Certainty of the evidence We found the overall certainty of the evidence to be very low. The trial itself was only published as an abstract from a conference which did not include numerical data and it was not published as a full report. This meant that we do not know many details about the trial. We thought that the overall risk of bias was unclear, as the trial authors did not describe how participants were put into the treatment groups, whether any participants dropped out or whether the planned outcomes were the same as the reported outcomes. The trial also had a very small number of participants and a limited age range, making it difficult to draw conclusions about the relevance of the treatment for all people with cystic fibrosis.",12,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Cystic Fibrosis [complications]; *Intestinal Obstruction [etiology, therapy]; Abdominal Pain [drug therapy, etiology]; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Female; Humans; Pancreas; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",10.1002/14651858.CD012798.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012798.pub3,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,18.0
CD003424.PUB5,"Ng, SM; Moore, HS",Drug therapies for reducing gastric acidity in people with cystic fibrosis,2021,"Abstract - Background Malabsorption of fat and protein contributes to poor nutritional status in people with cystic fibrosis. Impaired pancreatic function may also result in increased gastric acidity, leading in turn to heartburn, peptic ulcers and the impairment of oral pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. The administration of gastric acidâ€reducing agents has been used as an adjunct to pancreatic enzyme therapy to improve absorption of fat and gastroâ€intestinal symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis. It is important to establish the evidence regarding potential benefits of drugs that reduce gastric acidity in people with cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the effect of drug therapies for reducing gastric acidity for: nutritional status; symptoms associated with increased gastric acidity; fat absorption; lung function; quality of life and survival; and to determine if any adverse effects are associated with their use. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic and nonâ€electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals,  abstract books and conference proceedings. Both authors double checked the reference lists of the searches Most recent search of the Group's Trials Register: 26 April 2021. On the 26 April 2021 further searches were conducted on the clinicaltrials.gov register to identify any ongoing trials that may be of relevance. The WHO ICTRP database was last searched in 2020 and is not currently available for searching due to the Covidâ€19 pandemic. Selection criteria All randomised and quasiâ€randomised trials involving agents that reduce gastric acidity compared to placebo or a comparator treatment. Data collection and analysis Both authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Main results The searches identified 40 trials; 17 of these, with 273 participants, were suitable for inclusion, but the number of trials assessing each of the different agents was small. Seven trials were limited to children and four trials enrolled only adults. Metaâ€analysis was not performed, 14 trials were of a crossâ€over design and we did not have the appropriate information to conduct comprehensive metaâ€analyses. All the trials were run in single centres and duration ranged from five days to six months. The included trials were generally not reported adequately enough to allow judgements on risk of bias. However, one trial found that drug therapies that reduce gastric acidity improved gastroâ€intestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain; seven trials reported significant improvement in measures of fat malabsorption; and two trials reported no significant improvement in nutritional status. Only one trial reported measures of respiratory function and one trial reported an adverse effect with prostaglandin E2 analogue misoprostol. No trials have been identified assessing the effectiveness of these agents in improving quality of life, the complications of increased gastric acidity, or survival. Authors' conclusions Trials have shown limited evidence that agents that reduce gastric acidity are associated with improvement in gastroâ€intestinal symptoms and fat absorption. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to indicate whether there is an improvement in nutritional status, lung function, quality of life, or survival. Furthermore, due to the unclear risks of bias in the included trials, we are unable to make firm conclusions based on the evidence reported therein. We therefore recommend that large, multicentre, randomised controlled clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate these interventions. Plain language summary Drugs for reducing stomach acid for people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence for using drugs to reduce stomach acid in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Cystic fibrosis causes damage to the lungs and the pancreas. The pancreas produces enzymes which are needed for the body to digest and absorb food. If the pancreas is damaged this can affect how people can absorb food. It can also increase acidity in the stomach, which may lead to heartburn and peptic ulcers. There are drugs that can reduce the amount of acid in the stomach. Trials of these drugs have shown that they can improve problems in the stomach and digestive system and in the absorption of fat. This is an updated version of the review. Search date The evidence is current to: 26 April 2021. Study characteristics The review included at 17 trials with a total of 273 children and adults. Seven of the trials were limited to children and four trials enrolled only adults, while the remainder enrolled people of any age. All the trials were run in single centres and lasted from five days to six months. Most trials compared an intervention to placebo (a dummy treatment with no active medication). Six trials compared proton pump inhibitors (drugs which reduce the amount of acid made in the stomach, e.g. omeprazole and esomeprazole) to placebo and seven trials compared a H2 receptor antagonist (a second group of medicines that reduce the amount of acid made in the stomach, e.g. ranitidine and cimetidine) to placebo. One of the trials had three arms and compared a proton pump inhibitor to both a H2 receptor agonist and a placebo. In the remaining five trials, one compared pancrelipase (a combination of three enzymes (lipase, protease, and amylase) normally produced by the pancreas) to a combination of pancrelipase and misoprostol (a drug which protects the lining of the gut from stomach acid); one compared misoprostol to placebo and one trial compared enprostil (similar drug to misoprostol) to ranitidine. Two trials used sodium bicarbonate â€ one compared to placebo and the second compared to calcium carbonate. Key results We were not able to combine the results from these trials due to their design. Individual trials reported some improvements in abdominal pain and fat absorption. However, the trials did not report improvements for other outcomes such as lung function, quality of life, or survival. The different drugs studied caused some adverse events; mainly diarrhoea (two people withdrew from one trial because of this) and bloating due to wind. As we could not combine the results from these trials, we were not able to reach firm conclusions about whether people with cystic fibrosis would benefit from taking these drugs. New longâ€term trials are needed to examine the benefits and possible adverse effects for people with cystic fibrosis taking drugs to reduce stomach acid. Quality of the evidence There were 14 trials which had a crossâ€over design (where people taking part are given first one treatment and then another treatment) and we did not have the appropriate information to analyse the results properly. Few of the included trials reported clearly on aspects of trial quality or gave enough information to allow us to judge whether any factors might cause a potential risk of bias to the results.",4,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Abdominal Pain [drug therapy]; Adult; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications, drug therapy]; Dietary Fats [pharmacokinetics]; Gastric Acid [*metabolism]; Gastrointestinal Agents [therapeutic use]; Histamine H2 Antagonists [*therapeutic use]; Humans; Intestinal Absorption [drug effects]; Pancreas [enzymology]; Proton Pump Inhibitors [*therapeutic use]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",10.1002/14651858.CD003424.pub5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003424.pub5,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,42.0

Dietary advice (DA) encouraging consumption of energyâ€ and nutrientâ€rich foods rather than oral nutritional supplements (ONS) may be an initial treatment. Objectives To examine evidence that DA with/without ONS in adults with diseaseâ€related malnutrition improves survival, weight, anthropometry and quality of life (QoL). Search methods We identified relevant publications from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching. Last search: 01 March 2021. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of DA with/without ONS in adults with diseaseâ€related malnutrition in any healthcare setting compared with no advice, ONS or DA alone. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed study eligibility, risk of bias, extracted data and graded evidence. Main results We included 94, mostly parallel, RCTs (102 comparisons; 10,284 adults) across many conditions possibly explaining the high heterogeneity.  Participants were mostly older people in hospital, residential care and the community, with limited reporting on their sex. Studies lasted from one month to 6.5 years.  DA versus no advice â€ 24 RCTs (3523 participants) Most outcomes had lowâ€certainty evidence. There may be little or no effect on mortality after three months, RR 0.87 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 2.96), or at later time points. We had no threeâ€month data, but advice may make little or no difference to hospitalisations, or days in hospital after four to six months and up to 12 months. A similar effect was seen for complications at up to three months, MD 0.00 (95% CI â€0.32 to 0.32) and between four and six months. Advice may improve weight after three months, MD 0.97 kg (95% CI 0.06 to 1.87) continuing at four to six months and up to 12 months; and may result in a greater gain in fatâ€free mass (FFM) after 12 months, but not earlier. It may also improve global QoL at up to three months, MD 3.30 (95% CI 1.47 to 5.13), but not later. DA versus ONS â€ 12 RCTs (852 participants) All outcomes had lowâ€certainty evidence. There may be little or no effect on mortality after three months, RR 0.66 (95% CI 0.34 to 1.26), or at later time points. Either intervention may make little or no difference to hospitalisations at three months, RR 0.36 (95% CI 0.04 to 3.24), but ONS may reduce hospitalisations up to six months. There was little or no difference between groups in weight change at three months, MD â€0.14 kg (95% CI â€2.01 to 1.74), or between four to six months. Advice (one study) may lead to better global QoL scores but only after 12 months. No study reported days in hospital, complications or FFM. DA versus DA plus ONS â€ 22 RCTs (1286 participants) Most outcomes had lowâ€certainty evidence. There may be little or no effect on mortality after three months, RR 0.92 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.80) or at later time points. At three months advice may lead to fewer hospitalisations, RR 1.70 (95% CI 1.04 to 2.77), but not at up to six months. There may be little or no effect on length of hospital stay at up to three months, MD â€1.07 (95% CI â€4.10 to 1.97). At three months DA plus ONS may lead to fewer complications, RR 0.75 (95% CI o.56 to 0.99); greater weight gain, MD 1.15 kg (95% CI 0.42 to 1.87); and better global QoL scores, MD 0.33 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.57), but this was not seen at other time points. There was no effect on FFM at three months. DA plus ONS if required versus no advice or ONS â€ 31 RCTs (3308 participants) Evidence was moderateâ€ to lowâ€certainty. There may be little or no effect on mortality at three months, RR 0.82 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.16) or at later time points. Similarly, little or no effect on hospitalisations at three months, RR 0.83 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.15), at four to six months and up to 12 months; on days in hospital at three months, MD â€0.12 (95% CI â€2.48 to 2.25) or for complications at any time point. At three months, advice plus ONS probably improve weight, MD 1.25 kg (95% CI 0.73 to 1.76) and may improve FFM, 0.82 (95% CI 0.35 to 1.29), but these effects were not seen later. There may be little or no effect of either intervention on global QoL scores at three months, but advice plus ONS may improve scores at up to 12 months. DA plus ONS versus no advice or ONS â€ 13 RCTs (1315 participants) Evidence was lowâ€ to very lowâ€certainty. There may be little or no effect on mortality after three months, RR 0.91 (95% CI 0.55 to 1.52) or at later time points. No study reported hospitalisations and there may be little or no effect on days in hospital after three months, MD â€1.81 (95% CI â€3.65 to 0.04) or six months. Advice plus ONS may lead to fewer complications up to three months, MD 0.42 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.89) (one study). Interventions may make little or no difference to weight at three months, MD 1.08 kg (95% CI â€0.17 to 2.33); however, advice plus ONS may improve weight at four to six months and up to 12 months. Interventions may make little or no difference in FFM or global QoL scores at any time point. Authors' conclusions We found no evidence of an effect of any intervention on mortality. There may be weight gain with DA and with DA plus ONS in the short term, but the benefits of DA when compared with ONS are uncertain. The size and direction of effect and the length of intervention and followâ€up required for benefits to emerge were inconsistent for all other outcomes.  There were too few data for many outcomes to allow meaningful conclusions. Studies focusing on both patientâ€centred and healthcare outcomes are needed to address the questions in this review.

Background Ill people often have a poor appetite or feel sick because of medicines or other treatments and eat less than usual. Eating less over a longer time can cause weight loss, malnutrition, more health problems and death. Healthcare professionals may offer advice about dietary changes to help people to reâ€establish good eating habits. They might recommend highâ€protein and highâ€energy foods so that these people can gain weight and improve their nutrition and general health. It is common for sick people to be offered ONS with or without advice about changing their food intake. To find the best answer to our review question, we looked for studies that compared five different treatment options: dietary advice compared with no advice; dietary advice compared with ONS; dietary advice plus ONS compared with dietary advice; dietary advice plus ONS if appropriate compared with no dietary advice; and dietary advice plus ONS compared with no dietary advice and no ONS. To make these comparisons fair, we looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), where the people taking part had an equal chance (like the flip of a coin) of being in either group that was being compared.  Search date The evidence is current to: 01 March 2021. Study characteristics We found 94 studies (with a total of 10,284 people) that we could include in our review. Although older people have a higher risk of malnutrition, the people in these studies ranged from 17 to over 80 years of age and they were living either at home, in the community, or in hospital. They had a wide range of health conditions, including cancer, dementia and kidney disease. The studies reported on the participants for the length of their hospital stay or in some people in the community for up to six and a half years. Key results There is no evidence that any of the treatments affected how long many of the people in the studies lived. They did report some positive changes in energy intake (measured in calories), protein intake, weight, muscle bulk and quality of life. There were some reductions in complications and the length of time spent in hospital. However, there is no clear evidence about which treatment is the most helpful or the time it takes to achieve any benefit. Few studies reported results separately for men and women and so we cannot comment on whether there were any overall differences by sex. No studies recorded information about adverse events (harms) so we cannot offer a summary about possible harms. More research is needed to work out the best ways to help people who are losing weight because of illness in order to improve their clinical outcomes and quality of life. Certainty of the evidence Overall we rated the certainty of the evidence as low for most results, which means that we cannot be confident about the findings we report. There were several reasons for this. Some of the treatment comparisons that we looked at had only a few studies  and some of those had small numbers of participants. There were problems with the design of some studies that may have affected the results. Some people knew which treatment they were receiving. We think this may influence the way that they reported some changes, e.g. their energy and protein intake, body weight and quality of life. We think that the way the decision about which group a person went into at the start of the study may have affected the  results for some outcomes, e.g. change in weight, change in muscle bulk and mortality. We needed to see particular results to help us understand whether adults living with diseaseâ€related malnutrition can improve their survival, weight and general quality of life if they receive advice about diet with or without ONS. None of the studies reported all of the results that we needed to do this. We were not able to estimate whether participants gain any benefits from the treatments, such as shortening the length of hospital stay, lowering the risk of readmission to hospital or developing complications. The low certainty of evidence, with no evidence in many areas, means we cannot  make statements about any benefits and the possible disadvantages of these treatments despite the fact they are being used extensively in clinical practice. We recommend that future studies should be designed to measure these important patientâ€centred and healthcare outcomes as well as any potential harms.",12,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,*Malnutrition [etiology]; *Nutrition Therapy; Adult; Aged; Counseling; Humans; Quality of Life; Weight Gain,10.1002/14651858.CD002008.pub5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002008.pub5,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,317.0
CD009595.PUB3,"Burnham, P; Stanford, G; Stewart, R",Autogenic drainage for airway clearance in cystic fibrosis,2021,"Abstract - Background Autogenic drainage is an airway clearance technique that was developed by Jean Chevaillier in 1967. The technique is characterised by breathing control using expiratory airflow to mobilise secretions from smaller to larger airways. Secretions are cleared independently by adjusting the depth and speed of respiration in a sequence of controlled breathing techniques during exhalation. The technique requires training, concentration and effort from the individual but it has previously been shown to be an effective treatment option for those who are seeking techniques to support and promote independence.  However, at a time where the trajectory and demographics of the disease are changing, it is important to systematically review the evidence demonstrating that autogenic drainage is an effective intervention for people with cystic fibrosis. Objectives To compare the clinical effectiveness of autogenic drainage in people with cystic fibrosis with other physiotherapy airway clearance techniques. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews, as well as two ongoing trials registers (02 February 2021). Date of most recent search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 06 July 2021. Selection criteria We identified randomised and quasiâ€randomised controlled studies comparing autogenic drainage to another airway clearance technique or no therapy in people with cystic fibrosis for at least two treatment sessions. Data collection and analysis Data extraction and assessments of risk of bias were independently performed by three authors. The authors assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE system. The authors contacted seven teams of investigators for further information pertinent to their published studies. Main results Searches retrieved 64 references to 37 individual studies, of which eight (n = 212) were eligible for inclusion. One study was of parallel design with the remaining seven being crossâ€over in design; participant numbers ranged from 4 to 75. The total study duration varied between four days and two years. The age of participants ranged between seven and 63 years with a wide range of disease severity reported. Six studies enrolled participants who were clinically stable, whilst participants in two studies received treatment whilst hospitalised with an infective exacerbation. All studies compared autogenic drainage to one (or more) other recognised airway clearance technique. Exercise is commonly used as an alternative therapy by people with cystic fibrosis; however, there were no studies identified comparing exercise with autogenic drainage. The certainty of the evidence was generally low or very low. The main reasons for downgrading the level of evidence were the frequent use of a crossâ€over design, outcome reporting bias and the inability to blind participants. The review's primary outcome, forced expiratory volume in one second, was the most common outcome measured and was reported by all eight studies; only three studies reported on quality of life (also a primary outcome of the review). One study reported on adverse events and described a decrease in oxygen saturation levels whilst performing active cycle of breathing techniques, but not with autogenic drainage. Seven of the eight included studies measured forced vital capacity and three of the studies used mid peak expiratory flow (per cent predicted) as an outcome. Six studies reported sputum weight. Less commonly used outcomes included oxygen saturation levels, personal preference, hospital admissions, intravenous antibiotics and pseudomonas gene expression. There were no statistically significant differences found between any of the techniques used with respect to the outcomes measured except when autogenic drainage was described as being the preferred technique of the participants in one study over postural drainage and percussion. Authors' conclusions Autogenic drainage is a challenging technique that requires commitment from the individual. As such, this intervention merits systematic review to ensure its effectiveness for people with cystic fibrosis, particularly in an era where treatment options are changing rapidly. From the studies assessed, autogenic drainage was not found to be superior to any other form of airway clearance technique. Larger studies are required to better evaluate autogenic drainage in comparison to other airway clearance techniques in view of the relatively small number of participants in this review and the complex study designs. The studies recruited a range of participants and were not powered to assess nonâ€inferiority. The varied length and design of the studies made the analysis of pooled data challenging. Plain language summary The autogenic drainage breathing technique for helping people with cystic fibrosis to clear mucus from their airways Background Cystic fibrosis affects the lungs by producing thick mucus lining the airways. This can lead to infection and inflammation causing lung damage. Physiotherapy can help to keep the airways clear of mucus and there are many methods used to do this including breathing techniques, manual techniques and mechanical devices. Autogenic drainage is a very controlled technique of breathing which uses different depths and speeds of exhaled breath to move mucus up the airways resulting in a spontaneous or voluntary cough. It can be used without help, but requires training, concentration and effort. We looked at the effect of using autogenic drainage on lung function measurements and quality of life in people with cystic fibrosis, to discover whether using autogenic drainage was better or worse than other existing physiotherapy techniques for clearing the lungs. Search date The evidence is current to: 06 July 2021. Study characteristics We searched the literature for studies comparing at least two sessions of autogenic drainage with other breathing techniques and devices which help to clear the lungs of mucus. We included eight studies in the review involving 212 people with cystic fibrosis, aged between seven and 63 years of age .  People were randomly selected for one physiotherapy treatment or the other. The number of people in the studies ranged from 4 to 75, and had a wide range of disease severity. The studies lasted from four days to two years in total. Key results We did not find any clear evidence that autogenic drainage was better than the other techniques for lung function or quality of life in either the shortâ€term or longâ€term studies. This was also true for our other outcome measures such as hospital admissions, additional antibiotic treatment, exercise tolerance and oxygen saturation, but people in one study autogenic drainage preferred autogenic drainage compared to postural drainage and percussion. The authors of this review wanted to compare exercise to autogenic drainage for airway clearance, but found no studies with this comparison, even though exercise is often used as an alternative by people with cystic fibrosis. Certainty of the evidence Overall, the certainty of the evidence from the studies was judged to be mainly low or very low. The main problems for this being the small numbers of participants in each study, the unclear reporting of results in the studies and the study design used. In one study, which was classed as having a high risk of bias due to incomplete results, those taking part had to change physiotherapy technique halfway through the study and there were many who dropped out and did not comply with the postural drainage and percussion treatment arm.  Six of the eight studies used research staff to assess results who did not know which technique each person was using and this improved the quality of the evidence and reduced any bias in this respect.",12,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Cystic Fibrosis [therapy]; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Drainage, Postural; Humans; Middle Aged; Oxygen Saturation; Physical Therapy Modalities; Quality of Life; Young Adult",10.1002/14651858.CD009595.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009595.pub3,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,44.0
CD007923.PUB6,"Dentice, R; Elkins, M",Timing of dornase alfa inhalation for cystic fibrosis,2021,"Abstract - Background Inhalation of the enzyme dornase alfa reduces sputum viscosity and improves clinical outcomes of people with cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives To determine whether the timing of dornase alfa inhalation (in relation to airway clearance techniques or morning versus evening inhalation) has an impact on objective and subjective measures of clinical efficacy in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods Relevant randomised and quasiâ€randomised controlled trials were identified from the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), clinical trial registries and international cystic fibrosis conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 12 October 2020. Selection criteria Any trial of dornase alfa in people with cystic fibrosis where timing of inhalation was the randomised element in the trial with either: inhalation before compared to after airway clearance techniques; or morning compared to evening inhalation.  Data collection and analysis Both authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data with disagreements resolved by discussion. Relevant data were extracted and, where possible, metaâ€analysed. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. Main results We identified 115 trial reports representing 55 trials, of which five trials (providing data on 122 participants) met our inclusion criteria. All five trials used a crossâ€over design. Intervention periods ranged from two to eight weeks. Four trials (98 participants) compared dornase alfa inhalation before versus after airway clearance techniques. Inhalation after instead of before airway clearance did not significantly change forced expiratory volume at one second (veryâ€low quality evidence). Similarly, forced vital capacity (lowâ€quality evidence) and quality of life (veryâ€low quality evidence) were not significantly affected; forced expiratory flow at 25% was significantly worse with dornase alfa inhalation after airway clearance, mean difference â€0.17 litres (95% confidence interval â€0.28 to â€0.05), based on the pooled data from two small trials in children (7 to 19 years) with wellâ€preserved lung function. All other secondary outcomes were statistically nonâ€significant. In one trial (25 participants), morning versus evening inhalation had no impact on lung function or symptoms (lowâ€quality evidence). Authors' conclusions The current evidence derived from a small number of participants does not indicate that inhalation of dornase alfa after airway clearance techniques is more or less effective than the traditional recommendation to inhale nebulised dornase alfa 30 minutes prior to airway clearance techniques, for most outcomes. For children with wellâ€preserved lung function, inhalation before airway clearance may be more beneficial for small airway function than inhalation after. However, this result relied on a measure with high variability and trials with variable followâ€up. In the absence of strong evidence to indicate that one timing regimen is better than another, the timing of dornase alfa inhalation can be largely based on pragmatic reasons or individual preference with respect to the time of airway clearance and time of day. Further research is warranted. Plain language summary The timing of inhalation of dornase alfa in people with cystic fibrosis Review question To determine the effect of timing of dornase alfa inhalation on measures of effectiveness in people with cystic fibrosis (in relation to airway clearance techniques or time of day). This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Background Inhaling the enzyme dornase alfa reduces the stickiness of sputum and improves clinical outcomes in people with cystic fibrosis. It is not certain whether it is better to inhale dornase alfa before or after clearing the airways with physical techniques. It is also not clear whether it is better to inhale it in the morning or in the evening. Search date The evidence is current to: 12 October 2020. Study characteristics We included five trials with a total of 122 participants. In these trials the length of treatment ranged from two to eight weeks. Key results Four of the trials compared inhaling before to inhaling after the airways had been cleared and found no overall difference in clinical outcomes. However, in children with wellâ€preserved lung function, inhaling of dornase alfa before airway clearance techniques was better for small airways function. However, this did not affect quality of life or other outcomes. In the remaining trial, morning versus evening inhalation had no impact on lung function or symptoms. Therefore, for many people with cystic fibrosis, the timing of dornase alfa inhalation (before or after airway clearance or the time of day) can be based on practical reasons or individual preference. Quality of the evidence Apart from one trial published only in abstract form, the quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low. This was due to issues relating to group allocation, blinding, incomplete reporting of outcome data and the the limited age range of participants.",3,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Administration, Inhalation; Adolescent; Child; Combined Modality Therapy [methods]; Cystic Fibrosis [*therapy]; Deoxyribonuclease I [*administration & dosage]; Drug Administration Schedule; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Recombinant Proteins [administration & dosage]; Respiratory Therapy [*methods]; Time Factors; Vital Capacity; Young Adult",10.1002/14651858.CD007923.pub6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007923.pub6,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,47.0
CD013488.PUB2,"Ng, C; Major, G; Smyth, AR",Timing of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) in cystic fibrosis,2021,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive, lifeâ€limiting, multisystem disease affecting over 70,000 individuals worldwide. Between 80% and 90% of people with CF suffer with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, which if left untreated, leads to a poor nutritional status. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) has been shown to be effective in improving nutritional status and subsequently associated with improved lung function. However, the timings of PERT administration in relation to a meal are subjective and not standardised, meaning that variations in the timing of PERT dosing persist. Objectives The primary objective of the review is to compare the efficacy (fat absorption) and effectiveness (nutritional status, lung function and quality of life) of different PERT dosing strategies in terms of timing of administration for treating dietary malabsorption in all individuals with CF. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 24 June 2021. We also searched ongoing trials registers on 09 July 2021. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including crossâ€over RCTs with a minimum washout period of two weeks, and quasiâ€RCTs of PERT dosing regimens in people (of any age) with CF. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed and screened the studies identified from the searches. We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for our preâ€specified critical outcomes, but we did not identify any eligible studies. Main results No studies met the eligibility criteria and therefore we did not include any in this review. The excluded studies were either crossâ€over in design (but lacking a sufficient washout period between treatments) or did not assess the timing of PERT. One study which was terminated early is awaiting assessment pending further information. Authors' conclusions We were unable to determine whether one dosing schedule for PERT is better than another since we identified no eligible RCTs. While the introduction of PERT to people with CF can improve their nutritional status, there are a limited number of studies which address this review question, and none met our eligibility criteria. Since malnutrition and adverse gastrointestinal symptoms remain a common feature in CF, the assessment of the relative performance of dosing schedules may provide evidence to improve outcomes in people with CF who are pancreatic insufficient. Further research is needed to fully evaluate the role of dosing schedules for PERT in fat absorption. Research should also establish reliable outcome measures and minimal clinically important differences. While RCTs with a crossâ€over design may have advantages over a parallel group design, an adequate washout period between intervention periods is essential. Plain language summary Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy timings in cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the different timings of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) in people (of any age) with cystic fibrosis (CF). Background CF is an inherited condition affecting over 70,000 individuals worldwide. Between 80% and 90% of people with CF are not able to produce enough pancreatic enzymes to breakdown and absorb fat, protein and fatâ€soluble vitamins from food. This can lead to fatty stools (poo) and weight loss. It is thought that if fat is not digested properly, it could contribute to a higher risk of developing constipation or other serious gut complications such as distal intestinal obstruction syndrome. PERT provides the enzymes required to breakdown fat and the dosage is based upon the fat content of a meal or the person's body weight. PERT has been shown to improve weight and is associated with improved lung function. Despite current dose guidance, there are differences in PERT doses and there is no set guidance for when the therapy should be taken in relation to a meal (i.e. before, during or after eating). Search date The evidence is current to: 24 June 2021. Study characteristics We did not find any studies where PERT was given to people with CF who were pancreatic insufficient at different timings relative to their meals. We excluded nine studies. Four of these assessed the timing of PERT administration, but they had a crossâ€over design where participants had one intervention and then swapped to the second intervention. We excluded these studies because they did not leave enough time between the different interventions to be sure that the effects of the first intervention were not affecting the results from the second intervention. Four studies did not look at the timing of PERT and one study evaluated a new educational program for PERT. One study was terminated early and we will assess this again at the first update of this review if we are able to obtain more information from the investigators. Key results No studies met the eligibility criteria. Further research is needed to work out the best time to take PERT in relation to a meal.",8,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Cystic Fibrosis [complications, drug therapy]; Enzyme Replacement Therapy; Humans; Nutritional Status; Pancreas",10.1002/14651858.CD013488.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013488.pub2,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,15.0
CD010849.PUB4,"Hussein, N; Henneman, L; Kai, J; Qureshi, N","Preconception risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tayâ€Sachs disease",2021,"Abstract - Background Globally, about 6% of children are born with a serious birth defect of genetic or partially genetic origin. Carrier screening or testing is one way to identify couples at increased risk of having a child with an autosomal recessive condition. The most common autosomal recessive conditions are thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tayâ€Sachs disease, with higher carrier rates in highâ€risk populations of specific ancestral backgrounds. Identifying and counselling couples at genetic risk of the conditions before pregnancy enables them to make fully informed reproductive decisions, with some of these choices not being available if testing is only offered in an antenatal setting. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of systematic preconception genetic risk assessment to enable autonomous reproductive choice and to improve reproductive outcomes  in women and their partners who are both identified as carriers of thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tayâ€Sachs disease in healthcare settings when compared to usual care. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Registers. Date of latest search of the registers: 04 August 2021. In addition, we searched for all relevant trials from 1970 (or the date at which the database was first available if after 1970) to date using electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO), clinical trial databases (National Institutes of Health, Clinical Trials Search portal of the World Health Organization, metaRegister of controlled clinical trials), and hand searching of key journals and conference abstract books from 1998 to date ( European Journal of Human Genetics, Genetics in Medicine, Journal of Community Genetics ). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles, reviews and guidelines and also contacted subject experts in the field to request any unpublished or other published trials. Date of latest search of all these sources: 25 June 2021.  Selection criteria Any randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasiâ€RCTs (published or unpublished) comparing reproductive outcomes of systematic preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tayâ€Sachs disease when compared to usual care. Data collection and analysis We identified 37 papers, describing 22 unique trials which were potentially eligible for inclusion in the review. However, after assessment, we found no RCTs of preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tayâ€Sachs disease. Main results No RCTs of preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tayâ€Sachs disease are included. A trial identified earlier has published its results and has subsequently been listed as excluded in this review. Authors' conclusions As there are no RCTs of preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, or Tayâ€Sachs disease included in either the earlier or current versions of this review, we recommend considering potential nonâ€RCTs studies (for example prospective cohorts or beforeâ€andâ€after studies) for future reviews. While RCTs are desirable to inform evidenceâ€based practice and robust recommendations, the ethical, legal and social implications associated with using this trial design to evaluate the implementation of preconception genetic risk assessment involving carrier testing and reproductive autonomy must also be considered.  In addition, rather than focusing on single geneâ€byâ€gene carrier testing for specific autosomalâ€recessive conditions as the intervention being evaluated, preconception expanded genetic screening should also be included in future searches as this has received much attention in recent years as a more pragmatic strategy. The research evidence for current international policy recommendations is limited to nonâ€randomised studies. Plain language summary Identifying carrier status for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, or Tayâ€Sachs disease in nonâ€pregnant women and their partners Review question We looked for evidence to show whether identifying people who are carriers for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, or Tayâ€Sachs disease, before pregnancy leads to improving reproductive choice and pregnancy outcomes. Background Across the world, about 6% of children are born with a birth defect of genetic or partially genetic origin.  Many of these conditions can be passed down from parent to child. There are tests to identify the genetic risk of the most common genetic conditions (thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, or Tayâ€Sachs disease) before pregnancy. In these conditions, called autosomal recessive conditions, the parents of affected children are 'carriers' of the condition, which means they do not usually have symptoms. All 'carrier' couples will have a 25% chance of having an affected child. Risk assessment for these genetic conditions before getting pregnant would benefit potential parents who may be carriers. This information would give the atâ€risk couple the opportunity to make fully informed decisions about family planning. However, genetic risk assessment before pregnancy may potentially have a negative psychological impact. This is an updated version of the original review. Search date We last looked for evidence on 04 August 2021. Study characteristics We did not find any trials that we could include in this review. In an earlier version of this review, we had already found the protocol for a trial that has now published its results, but we have excluded the trial in this version of the review because it did not look at the right topic after all. Key results Although no trials were identified in which people taking part would have equal chances of being in either group, there are several studies which are not so strictly designed which support current policy recommendations for genetic risk assessment prior to pregnancy in routine clinical practice. We recommend considering potential observational studies in future reviews as well as looking at â€˜expanded carrier screeningâ€™ before pregnancy and not just screening for one condition. Any future trials need to consider legal, ethical and cultural barriers to implementing genetic risk assessment before pregnancy.",10,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Anemia, Sickle Cell [genetics]; *Cystic Fibrosis [genetics]; *Tay-Sachs Disease [genetics]; *Thalassemia; Female; Humans; Risk Assessment",10.1002/14651858.CD010849.pub4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010849.pub4,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,24.0
CD001127.PUB5,"Yang, C; Montgomery, M",Dornase alfa for cystic fibrosis,2021,"Abstract - Background Dornase alfa is currently used as a mucolytic to treat pulmonary disease (the major cause of morbidity and mortality) in cystic fibrosis. It reduces mucus viscosity in the lungs, promoting improved clearance of secretions. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To determine whether the use of dornase alfa in cystic fibrosis is associated with improved mortality and morbidity compared to placebo or other medications that improve airway clearance, and to identify any adverse events associated with its use. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals and abstracts from conferences. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Register: 12 October 2020. Clinicaltrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were also searched to identify unpublished or ongoing trials. Date of most recent search: 08 February 2021. Selection criteria All randomised and quasiâ€randomised controlled trials comparing dornase alfa to placebo, standard therapy or other medications that improve airway clearance. Data collection and analysis Authors independently assessed trials against the inclusion criteria; two authors carried out analysis of methodological quality and data extraction. GRADE was used to assess the level of evidence. Main results The searches identified 74 trials, of which 19 (2565 participants) met our inclusion criteria. 15 trials compared dornase alfa to placebo or no dornase alfa (2447 participants); two compared daily dornase to hypertonic saline (32 participants); one compared daily dornase alfa to hypertonic saline and alternate day dornase alfa (48 participants); one compared dornase alfa to mannitol and the combination of both drugs (38 participants). Trial duration varied from six days to three years. Dornase alfa compared to placebo or no treatment Dornase alfa probably improved forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV 1 ) at one month (four trials, 248 participants), three months (one trial, 320 participants; moderateâ€quality evidence), six months (one trial, 647 participants; highâ€quality evidence) and two years (one trial, 410 participants). Limited lowâ€quality evidence showed treatment may make little or no difference  in quality of life. Dornase alfa probably reduced the number of pulmonary exacerbations in trials of up to two years (moderateâ€quality evidence). One trial that examined the cost of care, including the cost of dornase alfa, found that the cost savings from dornase alfa offset 18% to 38% of the medication costs. Dornase alfa: daily versus alternate day One crossâ€over trial (43 children) found little or no difference between treatment regimens for lung function, quality of life or pulmonary exacerbations (lowâ€quality evidence). Dornase alfa compared to other medications that improve airway clearance Results for these comparisons were mixed. One trial (43 children) showed dornase alfa may lead to a greater improvement in FEV 1  compared to hypertonic saline (lowâ€quality evidence), and one trial (23 participants) reported little or no differences in lung function between dornase alfa and mannitol or dornase alfa and dornase alfa plus mannitol (lowâ€quality evidence). One trial (23 participants) found dornase alfa may improve quality of life compared to dornase alfa plus mannitol (lowâ€quality evidence); other comparisons found little or no difference in this outcome (lowâ€quality evidence). No trials in any comparison reported any difference between groups in the number of pulmonary exacerbations (lowâ€quality evidence). When all comparisons are assessed, dornase alfa did not cause significantly more adverse effects than other treatments, except voice alteration and rash. Authors' conclusions There is evidence to show that, compared with placebo, therapy with dornase alfa may improve lung function in people with cystic fibrosis in trials lasting from one month to two years. There was a decrease in pulmonary exacerbations in trials of six months or longer, probably due to treatment. Voice alteration and rash appear to be the only adverse events reported with increased frequency in randomised controlled trials. There is not enough evidence to firmly conclude if dornase alfa is superior to other hyperosmolar agents in improving lung function. Plain language summary Dornase alfa, an inhaled drug, for treating lung disease in cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of using inhaled dornase alfa for treating lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Cystic fibrosis is an inherited condition which affects the movement of salt across cells in the body and affects, for example, the sweat glands, airways, pancreas and male reproductive system. Lung disease is the most common cause of death in people with cystic fibrosis and although the average life expectancy has increased over the last 30 years, it is still only 48.5 years in highâ€income countries. People with cystic fibrosis develop chronic lung disease because of thick mucus that builds up in the lungs which causes infections and inflammation. Dornase alfa was developed to thin out this mucus, so it is easier for people to cough it up from their lungs; this in turn should decrease the number of infections and amount of inflammation and prevent chronic lung disease. Search date The evidence is current to: 12 October 2020. Study characteristics We included 19 trials with 2565 people with cystic fibrosis; 15 trials (2447 people) compared dornase alfa to placebo (a dummy treatment with no active medication) or no dornase alfa treatment; two trials (32 people) compared daily dornase to hypertonic saline; one trial (48 people) compared daily dornase alfa with hypertonic saline and alternate day dornase alfa; and one trial (38 people) compared dornase alfa to mannitol and the combination of both drugs. People from all age groups (infants through to adults) took part in the trials which lasted from six days to three years. Key results Dornase alfa compared to placebo or no treatment We found that dornase alfa probably improves lung function within one month when compared to a placebo or no treatment and this improvement was also seen in longer trials lasting from six months to two years (eight trials; 1708 participants). There were also fewer pulmonary exacerbations (flare up of lung inflammation) in these longer trials. One trial found that the cost savings from dornase alfa offset 18% to 38% of the medication costs. Dornase alfa â€ daily versus alternate day One trial (43 children) found no differences between treatment schedules for lung function, quality of life or pulmonary exacerbations. Dornase alfa compared to other medications that improve airway clearance The results from trials comparing dornase alfa to hypertonic saline or mannitol were mixed. One trial (43 children) showed a greater improvement in lung function with dornase alfa compared to hypertonic saline and one trial (23 participants) reported no difference in lung function between dornase alfa and mannitol or dornase alfa and dornase alfa plus mannitol. In one trial (23 participants) quality of life scores were better with dornase alfa alone than with dornase alfa plus mannitol; other drug comparisons found no difference between treatments for quality of life. No trials in any comparison of treatments reported any difference between groups in the number of pulmonary exacerbations. Overall, no serious side effects were reported, with only rash and a change in voice seen more frequently in those people taking dornase alfa. However, it is not definitively clear from the current evidence if dornase alfa is better than other medications such as hypertonic saline or mannitol. Quality of the evidence The quality of evidence from the trials comparing dornase alfa to placebo or no treatment was moderate to high for lung function results, but only one trial reported any changes in quality of life so the evidence for this outcome is limited. Also, there were few trials comparing different treatment schedules of dornase alfa (e.g. once a day versus twice a day) or comparing dornase alfa to other medications which help with clearing secretions, so current evidence from these trials is limited and of low quality.",3,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Cystic Fibrosis [*drug therapy]; Deoxyribonuclease I [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Disease Progression; Expectorants [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Infant; Mannitol [therapeutic use]; Placebos [therapeutic use]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Recombinant Proteins [adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Saline Solution, Hypertonic [therapeutic use]; Vital Capacity",10.1002/14651858.CD001127.pub5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001127.pub5,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,369.0
CD008901.PUB5,"Thaker, V; Carter, B; Putman, M",Recombinant growth hormone therapy for cystic fibrosis in children and young adults,2021,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited condition causing disease most noticeably in the lungs, digestive tract and pancreas. People with CF often have malnutrition and growth delay. Adequate nutritional supplementation does not improve growth optimally and hence an anabolic agent, recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH), has been proposed as a potential intervention. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of rhGH therapy in improving lung function, quality of life and clinical status of children and young adults with CF. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of latest search: 12 January 2021. We also searched ongoing trials registers: clinicaltrials.gov from the United States â€ date of latest search 19 Jun 2021;â€¨WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) â€ date of latest search 05 March 2018 (not available in 2021).  We conducted a search of relevant endocrine journals and proceedings of the Endocrinology Society meetings using Web of Science, Scopus and Proceedings First. Date of latest search: 21 Jun 2021.  Selection criteria Randomised and quasiâ€randomised controlled trials of all preparations of rhGH compared to either no treatment, or placebo, or each other at any dose (highâ€dose and lowâ€dose) or route and for any duration, in children or young adults (aged up to 25 years) diagnosed with CF (by sweat test or genetic testing). Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened papers, extracted trial details and assessed their risk of bias. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE system. Main results We included eight trials (291 participants, aged between five and 23 years) in the current version of the review. Seven trials compared standardâ€dose rhGH (approximately 0.3 mg/kg/week) to no treatment and one threeâ€arm trial (63 participants) compared placebo, standardâ€dose rhGH (0.3 mg/kg/week) and highâ€dose rhGH (0.5 mg/kg/week). Six trials lasted for one year and two trials for six months. We found that rhGH treatment may improve some of the pulmonary function outcomes, but there was no difference between standard and highâ€dose levels (lowâ€certainty evidence, limited by inconsistency across the trials, small number of participants and short duration of therapy). The trials show evidence of improvement in the anthropometric parameters (height, weight and lean body mass) with rhGH therapy, again no differences between dose levels. We found improvement in height for all comparisons (very lowâ€ to lowâ€certainty evidence), but improvements in weight and lean body mass were only reported for standardâ€dose rhGH versus no treatment (very lowâ€certainty evidence). There is some evidence indicating a change in the level of fasting blood glucose with rhGH therapy, however, it did not cross the clinical threshold for diagnosis of diabetes in the trials of short duration (lowâ€certainty evidence). There is lowâ€ to very lowâ€certainty evidence for improvement of pulmonary exacerbations with no further significant adverse effects, but this is limited by the short duration of trials and the small number of participants. One small trial provided inconsistent evidence on improvement in quality of life (very lowâ€certainty evidence). There is limited evidence from three trials in improvements in exercise capacity (lowâ€certainty evidence). None of the trials have systematically compared the expense of therapy on overall healthcare costs. Authors' conclusions When compared with no treatment, rhGH therapy is effective in improving the intermediate outcomes in height, weight and lean body mass. Some measures of pulmonary function showed moderate improvement, but no consistent benefit was seen across all trials. The significant change in blood glucose levels, although not causing diabetes, emphasizes the need for careful monitoring of this adverse effect with therapy in a population predisposed to CFâ€related diabetes. No significant changes in quality of life, clinical status or sideâ€effects were observed in this review due to the small number of participants. Longâ€term, wellâ€designed randomised controlled trials of rhGH in individuals with CF are required prior to routine clinical use of rhGH in CF. Plain language summary The use of recombinant growth hormone to improve growth and health in children and young adults with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effects of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) on the health of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Background CF is an inherited condition causing disease in the lungs, digestive system and pancreas. People with CF are often underweight and have delayed growth, which may impact their lung function. Nutritional supplements may not be enough and it has been suggested that treatment with rhGH, which improves the rate of growth and bone density, might help. Treatment with rhGH is usually given once a day via a needle under the skin. It is expensive and may affect glucose metabolism that has implications for children at risk of CFâ€related diabetes. Hence, we need to critically review the risks and benefits of this treatment. This is an update of an earlier review. Search date The evidence is current to: 12 January 2021. Study characteristics This review looked at using of rhGH to improve lung function, growth and quality of life for children and young adults with CF. It includes eight trials with 291 individuals with CF being selected for one treatment or the other randomly. The individuals in the trials were five to 23 years old, but most had not yet reached puberty. Six trials lasted for one year and two trials for six months. Treatment with rhGH was compared to no treatment in seven trials and to a placebo (a liquid that did not contain any growth hormone) in one trial. The trial that used a placebo compared it to two different doses of rhGH treatment. Key results Results showed a modest improvement in height, weight and lean body mass between six and 12 months. However, there was no consistent evidence that rhGH treatment improves lung function, muscle strength, or quality of life. The trials were small and we did not find any evidence on changes in glucose metabolism or the longâ€term risk of diabetes due to the treatment. Given these results, we are not able to identify any clear benefit of therapy and believe that more research from wellâ€designed, adequately powered clinical trials is needed. Certainty of the evidence We did not have enough information to decide if overall the trials were biased in a way that might affect the results. All the measured outcomes were clearly reported in the trials, but the trials were small and did not have enough participants to show a difference that may not have been due to chance. We also had concerns that outcomes that were based on personal judgment, such as quality of life scores, might be affected because those taking part in seven of the trials were able to tell which group they were in.",8,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Cystic Fibrosis [complications, drug therapy]; *Diabetes Mellitus; *Human Growth Hormone; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Growth Hormone; Humans; Quality of Life; Young Adult",10.1002/14651858.CD008901.pub5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008901.pub5,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,39.0
CD012619.PUB3,"Carroll, W; Green, J; Gilchrist, FJ",Interventions for preventing distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) in cystic fibrosis,2021,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common, lifeâ€limiting, genetically inherited disease. It affects multiple organs, particularly the respiratory system. However, gastrointestinal problems such as constipation and distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) are also important and wellâ€recognised complications in CF. They share similar symptoms e.g. bloating, abdominal pain, but are distinct conditions. Constipation occurs when there is gradual faecal impaction of the colon, but DIOS occurs when there is an accumulation of faeces and sticky mucus, forming a mass in the distal part of the small intestine. The mass may partially block the intestine (incomplete DIOS) or completely block the intestine (complete DIOS). Symptoms of DIOS can affect quality of life and other aspects of CF health, such as airway clearance, exercise, sleep and nutritional status. Treatment of constipation and prevention of complete bowel obstruction are required for gastrointestinal management in CF. However, many different strategies are used in clinical practice and there is a lack of consensus. The importance of this topic was highlighted in a recent research priority setting exercise by the James Lind Alliance. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of laxative agents of differing types for preventing DIOS (complete and incomplete) in children and adults with CF. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of search: 09 September 2021. We also searched online trial registries. Date of last search: 12 October 2021. Selection criteria Randomised and quasiâ€randomised controlled parallel trials comparing laxative therapy for preventing DIOS (including osmotic agents, stimulants, mucolytics and substances with more than one action) at any dose to placebo, no treatment or an alternative laxative therapy, in people of any age with pancreatic sufficient or insufficient CF and any stage of lung disease. Randomised crossâ€over trials were judged on an individual basis. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted outcome data and performed a risk of bias assessment for the included data. We judged the certainty of the evidence using GRADE criteria. Main results We included one crossâ€over trial (17 participants) with a duration of 12 months, in which participants were randomly allocated to either cisapride (a gastroâ€prokinetic agent) or placebo for six months each. The trial had an unclear risk of bias for most domains but had a high risk of reporting bias. Radiograph scores revealed no difference in occurrence of DIOS between cisapride and placebo (narrative report, no data provided). There were no adverse effects. Symptom scores were the only secondary outcome within the review that were reported. Total gastrointestinal symptom scores favoured cisapride with a statistically significant mean difference (MD) of â€7.60 (95% confidence interval (CI) â€14.73 to â€0.47). There was no significant difference at six months between cisapride and placebo for abdominal distension, MD â€0.90 (95% CI â€2.39 to 0.59) or abdominal pain, MD â€0.4 (95% CI â€2.05 to 1.25). The global symptom scores (whether individuals felt better or worse) were reported in the paper to favour cisapride and be statistically significant (P < 0.05). We assessed the available data to be very low certainty. There was a great deal of missing data from the included trial and the investigators failed to report numerical data for many outcomes. The overall risk of bias of the trial was unclear and it had a high risk for reporting bias. There was also indirectness; the trial drug (cisapride) has since been removed from the market in several countries due to adverse effects, thus it has no current applicability for preventing DIOS. The included trial also had very few participants, which downgraded the certainty a further level for precision. Authors' conclusions There is an absence of evidence for interventions for the prevention of DIOS. As there was only one included trial, we could not perform a metaâ€analysis of the data. Furthermore, the included trial compared a prokinetic agent (cisapride) that is no longer licensed for use in a number of countries due to the risk of serious cardiac events, a finding that came to light after the trial was conducted. Therefore, the limited findings from the trial are not applicable in current clinical practice. Overall, a great deal more research needs to be undertaken on gastrointestinal complications in CF, as this is a very poorly studied area compared to respiratory complications in CF. Plain language summary Which interventions are effective and safe for preventing distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) in cystic fibrosis? Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited, lifeâ€long condition that causes organ systems in the body to produce large amounts of thick and sticky mucus. The most commonly affected area is the lungs, in which thick mucus leads to recurrent chest infections and breathing difficulties. Another commonly affected area is the digestive system. Many people with CF suffer from bloating and abdominal pain which may be caused by constipation or distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS). In DIOS, overproduction of thick mucus combines with stool and sticks to the intestinal wall. This mass can partially block the intestine (incomplete DIOS) or completely block the intestine (complete DIOS). The latter causes severe pain, vomiting and is treated as a medical emergency. As part of effective care for people with CF, constipation should therefore be treated and complete bowel obstruction be prevented. It is also important to recognise that constipation and DIOS impact on other aspects of CF health. Bloating, abdominal pain and nausea may affect airway clearance, exercise and sleep. Nutritional status may also be affected due to decreased appetite and malabsorption. DIOS may affect the absorption of other medications taken by people with CF. Overall, DIOS can significantly impair quality of life. Different laxatives are currently used in clinics, but prescribing practices differ and there is no consensus on optimal treatment strategies. Hence, this review aimed to analyse the evidence for the preventing DIOS. Search date We last searched for evidence: 12 October 2021. Trial characteristics We included one trial in the review, which included 17 people aged between 13 to 35 years. These people were randomly put into groups to take either a placebo drug (with no active medication) or cisapride for six months each and then to cross over and take the alternative treatment for a further six months. Key results The trial used radiography to diagnose DIOS, but did not provide any data and only stated that there was no difference between cisapride and placebo. The trial also stated that there were no adverse effects from the cisapride. The trial assessed participantâ€reported total and individual gastrointestinal symptom scores. People in the cisapride group reported an improvement in total gastrointestinal symptom scores compared to those in the placebo group. However, there were no differences reported between groups for the individual symptom scores of abdominal pain and abdominal distension (swelling). Participants also reported global symptom scores, which showed that most people felt better taking cisapride compared to placebo. Certainty of the evidence The overall certainty of the evidence was very low. With one trial in this review, we could not combine data from different trials. The trial did not provide enough information about the methods used for allocating participants or about missing data and did not fully report certain results. The small number of participants also lowered the precision of the results. Since this trial was conducted, cisapride has been removed from the market in a number of countries due to rare but serious heart complications, therefore it has no applicability to current clinical practice.",12,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Cystic Fibrosis [complications]; *Intestinal Obstruction [etiology, prevention & control]; Cisapride; Constipation [etiology, prevention & control]; Humans; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",10.1002/14651858.CD012619.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012619.pub3,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,21.0
CD008319.PUB4,"Smith, S; Rowbotham, NJ; Charbek, E",Inhaled antibiotics for pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis,2022,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder in which abnormal mucus in the lungs is associated with susceptibility to persistent infection. Pulmonary exacerbations are when symptoms of infection become more severe. Antibiotics are an essential part of treatment for exacerbations and inhaled antibiotics may be used alone or in conjunction with oral antibiotics for milder exacerbations or with intravenous antibiotics for more severe infections. Inhaled antibiotics do not cause the same adverse effects as intravenous antibiotics and may prove an alternative in people with poor access to their veins. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To determine if treatment of pulmonary exacerbations with inhaled antibiotics in people with cystic fibrosis improves their quality of life, reduces time off school or work, and improves their longâ€term lung function. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register. Date of the last search: 7 March 2022. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry and WHO ICTRP for relevant trials. Date of last search: 3 May 2022. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials in people with cystic fibrosis with a pulmonary exacerbation in whom treatment with inhaled antibiotics was compared to placebo, standard treatment or another inhaled antibiotic for between one and four weeks. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected eligible trials, assessed the risk of bias in each trial and extracted data. They assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE criteria. Authors of the included trials were contacted for more information. Main results Five trials with 183 participants are included in the review. Two trials (77 participants) compared inhaled antibiotics alone to intravenous antibiotics alone and three trials (106 participants) compared a combination of inhaled and intravenous antibiotics to intravenous antibiotics alone. Trials were heterogenous in design and two were only available in abstract form. Risk of bias was difficult to assess in most trials but, for four out of five trials, we judged there to be a high risk from lack of blinding and an unclear risk with regards to randomisation. Results were not fully reported and only limited data were available for analysis. One trial was a crossâ€over design and we only included data from the first intervention arm. Inhaled antibiotics alone versus intravenous antibiotics alone Only one trial (18 participants) reported a perceived improvement in lifestyle (quality of life) in both groups (very lowâ€certainty evidence). Neither trial reported on time off work or school. Both trials measured lung function, but there was no difference reported between treatment groups (very lowâ€certainty evidence). With regards to our secondary outcomes, one trial (18 participants) reported no difference in the need for additional antibiotics and the second trial (59 participants) reported on the time to next exacerbation. In neither case was a difference between treatments identified (both very lowâ€certainty evidence). The single trial (18 participants) measuring adverse events and sputum microbiology did not observe any in either treatment group for either outcome (very lowâ€certainty  evidence). Inhaled antibiotics plus intravenous antibiotics versus intravenous antibiotics alone Inhaled antibiotics plus intravenous antibiotics may make little or no difference to quality of life compared to intravenous antibiotics alone. None of the trials reported time off work or school. All three trials measured lung function, but found no difference between groups in forced expiratory volume in one second (two trials; 44 participants; very lowâ€certainty evidence) or vital capacity (one trial; 62 participants). None of the trials reported on the need for additional antibiotics. Inhaled plus intravenous antibiotics may make little difference to the time to next exacerbation; however, one trial (28 participants) reported on hospital admissions and found no difference between groups. There is likely no difference between groups in adverse events (very lowâ€certainty evidence) and one trial (62 participants) reported no difference in the emergence of antibioticâ€resistant organisms (very lowâ€certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions We identified only lowâ€ or very lowâ€certainty evidence to judge the effectiveness of inhaled antibiotics for the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis. The included trials were not sufficiently powered to achieve their goals. Hence, we are unable to demonstrate whether one treatment was superior to the other or not. Further research is needed to establish whether inhaled tobramycin may be used as an alternative to intravenous tobramycin for some pulmonary exacerbations. Plain language summary Inhaling antibiotics to treat temporary worsening of lung infection in people with cystic fibrosis Review question What evidence is there for using inhaled antibiotics to treat exacerbations (flare ups) of lung infection in people with cystic fibrosis? Background Cystic fibrosis is a serious genetic disorder that results in abnormally sticky mucus in several parts of the body. In the lungs this sticky mucus can lead to repeated infections. An exacerbation makes the symptoms of infection more severe. Antibiotics are an essential part of treatment and may be given by mouth (orally), by needle into the blood stream (intravenously) or by inhaling the drug. We wanted to learn if inhaling antibiotics improved general health compared to the other methods. This might mean that people with cystic fibrosis could avoid hospitalisation for intravenous antibiotics and some side effects of intravenous treatment. Inhaling the antibiotics would also be easier for people who have difficulty with access to their veins. This is an updated version of the review. Search date We last looked for evidence on 7 March 2022. Study characteristics We found five trials comparing different ways of giving antibiotics when treating exacerbations in a total of 183 people with cystic fibrosis. Two trials compared inhaled antibiotics alone to intravenous antibiotics alone (77 participants) and three trials compared a combination of inhaled and intravenous antibiotics to intravenous antibiotics alone (106 participants). In all trials, the inhaled antibiotics were compared to the same antibiotics given intravenously. The numbers of participants in each trial ranged from 16 to 62. Key results Inhaled antibiotics alone versus intravenous antibiotics alone One trial (18 participants) reported a perceived improvement in lifestyle in both groups, but neither trial reported on time off work or school. Both trials measured lung function, but neither reported any difference between treatment groups. One trial (18 participants) reported no difference in the need for additional antibiotics and the second trial (59 participants) reported on the length of time until the next exacerbation â€ there was no difference between inhaled or intravenous antibiotics for either outcome. Only one trial (18 participants) measured adverse events and sputum microbiology, but did not find any difference between treatments for either outcome. Inhaled antibiotics plus intravenous antibiotics versus intravenous antibiotics alone One trial found that there is likely no difference in quality of life between treatments. All of the trials reported lung function, but found no difference between groups. One trial showed there to be little or no difference in the time until the next exacerbation. None of the trials reported on the need for additional antibiotics; however, one trial (28 participants) found no difference in the number of hospital admissions between groups. There may be no difference between groups in adverse events and one trial (62 participants) reported no difference in the appearance of antibioticâ€resistant organisms. Certainty of the evidence We graded the certainty of the evidence as very low or low. We had concerns since only one trial stated how the participants were diagnosed with CF or how they defined an exacerbation. It was not possible to keep secret which treatment the participants were receiving, as the trials compared different ways of giving the antibiotics; we thought this would likely influence some of the results. We were not sure whether the participants were put into the different groups truly at random and we do not know how this might have affected the results.",8,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Anti-Bacterial Agents [administration & dosage, therapeutic use]; *Cystic Fibrosis [complications, drug therapy]; Administration, Inhalation; Humans; Lung; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Tobramycin [administration & dosage, therapeutic use]",10.1002/14651858.CD008319.pub4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008319.pub4,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,19.0
CD009650.PUB5,"Lo, DKH; Muhlebach, MS; Smyth, AR",Interventions for the eradication of meticillinâ€resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in people with cystic fibrosis,2022,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis is an inherited recessive disorder of chloride transport that is characterised by recurrent and persistent pulmonary infections from resistant organisms that result in lung function deterioration and early mortality in sufferers. Meticillinâ€resistant  Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) has emerged not only as an important infection in people who are hospitalised, but also as a potentially harmful pathogen in cystic fibrosis. Chronic pulmonary infection with MRSA is thought to confer on people with cystic fibrosis a worse clinical outcome and result in an increased rate of lung function decline. Clear guidance for MRSA eradication in cystic fibrosis, supported by robust evidence, is urgently needed. This is an update of a previous review. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of treatment regimens designed to eradicate MRSA and to determine whether the eradication of MRSA confers better clinical and microbiological outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis. To ascertain whether attempts at eradicating MRSA can lead to increased acquisition of other resistant organisms (including  Pseudomonas aeruginosa ), increased adverse effects from drugs, or both. Search methods We identified randomised and quasiâ€randomised controlled trials by searching the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders (CFGD) Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, PubMed, MEDLINE and three clinical trials registries; by handsearching article reference lists; and through contact with experts in the field. We last searched the CFGD Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register on 4 October 2021, and the ongoing trials registries on 31 January 2022. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasiâ€RCTs of any combinations of topical, inhaled, oral or intravenous antimicrobials primarily aimed at eradicating MRSA compared with placebo, standard treatment or no treatment. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and used the GRADE methodology to assess the certainty of the evidence. Main results The review includes three RCTs with 135 participants with MRSA infection. Two trials compared active treatment versus observation only and one trial compared active treatment with placebo.  Active treatment versus observation In both trials (106 participants), active treatment consisted of oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin. One trial administered this combination for two weeks alongside nasal, skin and oral decontamination and a threeâ€week environmental decontamination, while the second trial administered this drug combination for 21 days with five days intranasal mupirocin. Both trials reported successful eradication of MRSA in people with cystic fibrosis, but they used different definitions of eradication. One trial (45 participants) defined MRSA eradication as negative MRSA respiratory cultures at day 28, and reported that oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin may lead to a higher proportion of negative cultures compared to control (odds ratio (OR) 12.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.84 to 55.84; lowâ€certainty evidence). However, by day 168 of followâ€up, there was no difference between groups in the proportion of participants who remained MRSAâ€negative (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.31 to 4.42; lowâ€certainty evidence). The second trial defined successful eradication as the absence of MRSA following treatment in at least three cultures over a period of six months. We are uncertain if the intervention led to results favouring the treatment group as the certainty of the evidence was very low (OR 2.74, 95% CI 0.64 to 11.75). There were no differences between groups in the remaining outcomes for this comparison: quality of life, frequency of exacerbations or adverse effects (all lowâ€certainty evidence) or the change from baseline in lung function or weight (both very lowâ€certainty evidence). The time until next positive MRSA isolate was not reported. The included trials found no differences between groups in terms of nasal colonisation with MRSA. While not a specific outcome of this review, investigators from one study reported that the rate of hospitalisation from screening through day 168 was lower with oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin compared to control (rate ratio 0.22, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.72; P = 0.01). Nebulised vancomycin with oral antibiotics versus nebulised placebo with oral antibiotics The third trial (29 participants) defined eradication as a negative respiratory sample for MRSA at one month following completion of treatment. No differences were reported in MRSA eradication between treatment arms (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.14 to 7.39; lowâ€certainty evidence). No differences between groups were seen in lung function or adverse effects (lowâ€certainty evidence), in quality of life (very lowâ€certainty evidence) or nasal colonisation with MRSA. The trial did not report on the change in weight or frequency of exacerbations.  Authors' conclusions Early eradication of MRSA is possible in people with cystic fibrosis, with one trial demonstrating superiority of active MRSA treatment compared with observation only in terms of the proportion of MRSAâ€negative respiratory cultures at day 28. However, followâ€up at three or six months showed no difference between treatment and control in the proportion of participants remaining MRSAâ€negative. Moreover, the longerâ€term clinical consequences â€“ in terms of lung function, mortality and cost of care â€“ remain unclear. Using GRADE methodology, we judged the certainty of the evidence provided by this review to be very low to low, due to potential biases from the openâ€label design, high rates of attrition and small sample sizes. Based on the available evidence, we believe that whilst early eradication of respiratory MRSA in people with cystic fibrosis is possible, there is not currently enough evidence regarding the clinical outcomes of eradication to support the use of the interventions studied. Plain language summary Treatments to clear the 'superbug' meticillinâ€resistant  Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) from the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis Review question We looked for evidence for the effects of different ways of clearing meticillinâ€resistant  Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA), a soâ€called 'superbug', from the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis. Background MRSA is a type of bacteria resistant to some types of antibiotics (medicines that kill or inhibit bacteria). Because MRSA is hard to treat, it is sometimes called a 'superbug'. Infection with MRSA is particularly worrying for people with cystic fibrosis, an inherited condition which, amongst other things, causes thick mucus to build up in the lungs. It is very difficult for people with cystic fibrosis to cough up this thick mucus, making it an ideal breeding ground for bacteria, including MRSA, and making these people more prone to chest infections. It is thought that MRSA can cause more damage than other bacteria which are not resistant to antibiotics. We wanted to identify research evidence to support the best way for treating MRSA infections and also to see if this treatment would improve the lives of people with cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published review. Search date The evidence is current to 31 January 2022. Key results We found three studies which included 135 people with cystic fibrosis and a diagnosed MRSA infection.  Two studies (106 people) compared treatment given to one group of people versus observation only of a second group of people. In one of these studies, people in the active treatment group were given oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin (all three are antibiotic medicines), plus additional decontamination treatment. In the second trial, people in the active treatment group were given two antibiotics orally (coâ€trimoxazole and rifampicin) and one by nose spray (mupirocin). The results of these studies showed that clearing MRSA from the airways of people with cystic fibrosis is possible. In both trials, a larger proportion of those who were treated cleared MRSA. However, some people who were untreated also cleared MRSA spontaneously. Also, six months after treatment, the number of individuals who still had MRSA was not different between those who had received treatment and those who had not. We found no differences between treatment groups in quality of life, frequency of exacerbations (that is, flareâ€ups of the disease), unwanted or harmful effects of treatment, nasal colonisation with MRSA, or in changes in lung function or weight. The studies did not report the length of time until finding the next positive MRSA result in participants. In one of the studies, fewer people who were treated with antibiotics were admitted to hospital in the first 168 days.  The third study compared treatment groups who were given either an inhaled antibiotic or an inhaled placebo (inactive substance). Both groups were also given the same oral antibiotics. In this study, there was no difference between groups in MRSA clearance. There were no differences between groups in lung function, quality of life, unwanted or harmful effects or nasal colonisation with MRSA. The trial did not report on change in weight or frequency of exacerbations.  Treating MRSA early in people with cystic fibrosis has been shown to be possible, but it is not clear what longerâ€term implications this treatment will have. Main limitations of the evidence We had little or no confidence in the evidence we found for the different outcomes. This was due to potential issues from the study designs, where people knew which treatment each participant was receiving (groups were either given medication or just observed), and because there were small numbers of people in each study.",12,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,*Cystic Fibrosis [drug therapy]; *Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Anti-Bacterial Agents [therapeutic use]; Humans; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Rifampin [therapeutic use],10.1002/14651858.CD009650.pub5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009650.pub5,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,70.0
CD002204.PUB5,"Francis, NZ; Southern, KW",Antifungal therapies for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis,2022,"Abstract - Background Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is an allergic reaction to colonisation of the lungs with the fungus  Aspergillus fumigatus,  and affects around 10% of people with cystic fibrosis. ABPA is associated with an accelerated decline in lung function. High doses of corticosteroids are the main treatment for ABPA; although the longâ€term benefits are not clear, and their many side effects are wellâ€documented. A group of compounds, the azoles, have activity against  A fumigatus , and have been proposed as an alternative treatment for ABPA. Of this group, itraconazole is the most active. A separate antifungal compound, amphotericin B, has been used in aerosolised form to treat invasive infection with  A fumigatus , and may have potential for the treatment of ABPA. Antifungal therapy for ABPA in cystic fibrosis needs to be evaluated. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives The review aimed to test the hypotheses that antifungal interventions for the treatment of ABPA in cystic fibrosis:â€¨1. improve clinical status compared to placebo or standard therapy (no placebo); andâ€¨2. do not have unacceptable adverse effects. If benefit was demonstrated, we planned to assess the optimal type, duration, and dose of antifungal therapy. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals, and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Trials Register was 28 September 2021. We searched ongoing trials registries, most recently on 11 March 2022. Earlier, we also approached pharmaceutical companies regarding possible unpublished trials. Selection criteria Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials, in which antifungal treatments were compared to either placebo or no treatment, or where different doses of the same treatment were used in the treatment of ABPA in people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis The searches identified six trials; none of which met the inclusion criteria for the review. Main results We included no completed randomised controlled trials. There is currently one ongoing trial, which we may find eligible for a future update. Authors' conclusions At present, there are no randomised controlled trials that evaluate the use of antifungal therapies for the treatment of ABPA in people with cystic fibrosis, although one trial is currently ongoing. Trials with clear outcome measures are needed to properly evaluate the use of corticosteroids in people with ABPA and cystic fibrosis. Plain language summary Treatments to fight fungal infections that cause allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We planned to review the evidence about the effect of treatments to fight fungal infections that cause allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in people with cystic fibrosis. Background ABPA is an allergic lung reaction to a type of fungus (usually  Aspergillus fumigatus ) in some people with cystic fibrosis. It causes a cough and wheezing, and sometimes fever. If left untreated, ABPA can lead to longâ€term lung damage. It is usually treated with a high dose of corticosteroids (also known as steroids). However, it has not been proven that corticosteroids can prevent lung function from deteriorating in the long term. Also, longâ€term use of corticosteroids is linked to some serious side effects. Treating the fungus that causes ABPA may be an alternative to using high doses of corticosteroids to combat the allergic reaction. This is an update of a previously published review. Search date The evidence is current to 28 September 2021. Study characteristics We did not find any trials that we could include in the review. Key results There is currently no evidence to recommend the use of antifungal treatment in people with cystic fibrosis and ABPA. We need trials to assess the effects of corticosteroids in this population in the long and the short term.",9,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Aspergillosis, Allergic Bronchopulmonary [complications, drug therapy]; *Cystic Fibrosis [complications, drug therapy]; Antifungal Agents [therapeutic use]; Aspergillus fumigatus; Humans; Itraconazole [therapeutic use]",10.1002/14651858.CD002204.pub5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002204.pub5,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,100.0
CD001021.PUB4,"Smith, S; Rowbotham, NJ",Inhaled antiâ€pseudomonal antibiotics for longâ€term therapy in cystic fibrosis,2022,"Abstract - Background Inhaled antibiotics are commonly used to treat persistent airway infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  that contributes to lung damage in people with cystic fibrosis. Current guidelines recommend inhaled tobramycin for individuals with cystic fibrosis and persistent  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  infection who are aged six years or older. The aim is to reduce bacterial load in the lungs so as to reduce inflammation and deterioration of lung function. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To evaluate the effects of longâ€term inhaled antibiotic therapy in people with cystic fibrosis on clinical outcomes (lung function, frequency of exacerbations and nutrition), quality of life and adverse events (including drugâ€sensitivity reactions and survival). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched ongoing trials registries. Date of last search: 28 June 2022. Selection criteria We selected trials where people with cystic fibrosis received inhaled antiâ€pseudomonal antibiotic treatment for at least three months, treatment allocation was randomised or quasiâ€randomised, and there was a control group (either placebo, no placebo or another inhaled antibiotic). Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected trials, judged the risk of bias, extracted data from these trials and judged the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE system. Main results The searches identified 410 citations to 125 trials; 18 trials (3042 participants aged between five and 45 years) met the inclusion criteria. Limited data were available for metaâ€analyses due to the variability of trial design and reporting of results. A total of 11 trials (1130 participants) compared an inhaled antibiotic to placebo or usual treatment for a duration between three and 33 months. Five trials (1255 participants) compared different antibiotics, two trials (585 participants) compared different regimens of tobramycin and one trial (90 participants) compared intermittent tobramycin with continuous tobramycin alternating with aztreonam. One trial (18 participants) compared an antibiotic to placebo and also to a different antibiotic and so fell into both groups. The most commonly studied antibiotic was tobramycin which was studied in 12 trials. Inhaled antibiotics compared to placebo We found that inhaled antibiotics may improve lung function measured in a variety of ways (4 trials, 814 participants). Compared to placebo, inhaled antibiotics may also reduce the frequency of exacerbations (risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47 to 0.93; 3 trials, 946 participants; lowâ€certainty evidence). Inhaled antibiotics may lead to fewer days off school or work (quality of life measure) (mean difference (MD) â€5.30 days, 95% CI â€8.59 to â€2.01; 1 trial, 245 participants; lowâ€certainty evidence). There were insufficient data for us to be able to report an effect on nutritional outcomes and there was no effect on survival. There was no effect on antibiotic resistance seen in the two trials that were included in metaâ€analyses. We are uncertain of the effect of the intervention on adverse events (very lowâ€certainty evidence), but tinnitus and voice alteration were the only events occurring more often in the inhaled antibiotics group. The overall certainty of evidence was deemed to be low for most outcomes due to risk of bias within the trials and imprecision due to low event rates. Different antibiotics or regimens compared Of the eight trials comparing different inhaled antibiotics or different antibiotic regimens, there was only one trial for each unique comparison. We found no differences between groups for any outcomes except for the following. Aztreonam lysine for inhalation probably improved forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV 1 ) % predicted compared to tobramycin (MD â€3.40%, 95% CI â€6.63 to â€0.17; 1 trial, 273 participants; moderateâ€certainty evidence). However, the method of defining the endpoint was different to the remaining trials and the participants were exposed to tobramycin for a long period making interpretation of the results problematic. We found no differences in any measure of lung function in the remaining comparisons. Trials measured pulmonary exacerbations in different ways and showed no differences between groups except for aztreonam lysine probably leading to fewer people needing treatment with additional antibiotics than with tobramycin (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.86; 1 trial, 273 participants; moderateâ€certainty evidence); and there were fewer hospitalisations due to respiratory exacerbations with levofloxacin compared to tobramycin (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.98; 1 trial, 282 participants; highâ€certainty evidence). Important treatmentâ€related adverse events were not very common across comparisons, but were reported less often in the tobramycin group compared to both aztreonam lysine and colistimethate. We found the certainty of evidence for these comparisons to be directly related to the risk of bias within the individual trials and varied from low to high. Authors' conclusions Longâ€term treatment with inhaled antiâ€pseudomonal antibiotics probably improves lung function and reduces exacerbation rates, but pooled estimates of the level of benefit were very limited. The best evidence available is for inhaled tobramycin. More evidence from trials measuring similar outcomes in the same way is needed to determine a better measure of benefit. Longerâ€term trials are needed to look at the effect of inhaled antibiotics on quality of life, survival and nutritional outcomes. Plain language summary Inhaling antibiotics to treat lung infection in people with cystic fibrosis Review question Are inhaled antibiotics helpful against persistent infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in people with cystic fibrosis (CF)? Key messages As people with CF get older, they are more likely to become infected on a longâ€term basis with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  This is the most common cause of chronic lung infection in people with CF . We wanted to find out whether antibiotics targeting  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  would reduce the effects of infection when they are breathed into the lungs. We wanted to learn whether this treatment would improve lung function, quality of life and survival. We also looked for any harmful effects. What is CF? Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease which results in abnormal mucus in several parts of the body and mainly affects the lungs, which are susceptible to infection by certain bacteria. Infection causes inflammation which results in progressive damage to the lungs. What did we find? The review includes 18 trials with 3042 people with CF aged between five and 45 years of age .  The trials lasted from three to 33 months. In 11 trials investigators compared inhaled antibiotics with a placebo (an inhaled substance without the medication in it) and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly. Eight trials compared one inhaled antibiotic with either a different inhaled antibiotic or a different schedule of the same inhaled antibiotic. One of the trials compared an antibiotic both to placebo and to a different antibiotic and so fell into both groups. Main results Results from four trials showed that when compared to placebo, inhaled antibiotics may improve lung function and reduce the number of times the people with CF had a worsening of symptoms (exacerbation). Inhaled antibiotics may also mean fewer days off school or work (a measure of quality of life). They did not seem to have an effect on survival. We are not sure of the side effects of inhaled antibiotics, but tinnitus and changes in voice were reported more often in people inhaling antibiotics rather than the placebo. We did not find enough evidence to be able to comment on how inhaled antibiotics affect height and weight. Where the trials compared different inhaled antibiotics or schedules, there was only one trial in each of the eight different comparisons. The only differences we found in all these comparisons were for two outcomes. In one trial we found that aztreonam lysine probably improved lung function more than tobramycin, but no important differences were found in the other trials with regard to lung function. Aztreonam lysine also probably led to fewer people needing additional courses of antibiotics than tobramycin and there were fewer hospitalisations after levofloxacin compared to placebo. We noted that important side effects that were related to the treatment were not very common in the trials, but they were less common with tobramycin than with other antibiotics. What are the limitations of the evidence? The trials that we included in this review measured lung function in different ways and also how often people experienced a sudden worsening of symptoms. That made it difficult for us to combine the results of different trials to strengthen our evidence. We thought the overall certainty of evidence was low for most outcomes, mainly due to risks of bias within the trials and low event rates meaning results were not precise.

CD013666.PUB2,"Smith, S; Rowbotham, NJ; Edwards, CT",Shortâ€acting inhaled bronchodilators for cystic fibrosis,2022,"Abstract - Background Respiratory disease is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF), and many different therapies are used by people with CF in the management of respiratory problems. Bronchodilator therapy is used to relieve symptoms of shortness of breath and to open the airways to allow clearance of mucus. Despite the widespread use of inhaled bronchodilators in CF, there is little objective evidence of their efficacy. A Cochrane Review looking at both shortâ€ and longâ€acting inhaled bronchodilators for CF was withdrawn from the Cochrane Library in 2016. That review has been replaced by two separate Cochrane Reviews: one on longâ€acting inhaled bronchodilators for CF, and this review on shortâ€acting inhaled bronchodilators for CF. For this review 'inhaled' includes the use of pressurised metered dose inhalers (MDIs), with or without a spacer, dry powder devices and nebulisers. Objectives To evaluate shortâ€acting inhaled bronchodilators in children and adults with CF in terms of clinical outcomes and safety. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books on 28 March 2022 and searched trial registries for any new or ongoing trials on 12 April 2022. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Selection criteria We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasiâ€RCTs that looked at the effect of any shortâ€acting inhaled bronchodilator delivered by any device, at any dose, at any frequency and for any duration compared to either placebo or another shortâ€acting inhaled bronchodilator in people with CF. We screened references as per standard Cochrane methodology. Data collection and analysis Two review authors extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool. Where we were not able to enter data into our analyses we reported results directly from the papers. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Main results We included 11 trials from our systematic search, with 191 participants meeting our inclusion criteria; three of these trials had three treatment arms. Eight trials compared shortâ€acting inhaled betaâ€2 agonists to placebo and four trials compared shortâ€acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists to placebo. Three trials compared shortâ€acting inhaled betaâ€2 agonists to shortâ€acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists. All were crossâ€over trials with only small numbers of participants. We were only able to enter data into the analysis from three trials comparing shortâ€acting inhaled betaâ€2 agonists to placebo. Shortâ€acting inhaled betaâ€2 agonists versus placebo All eight trials (six singleâ€dose trials and two longerâ€term trials) reporting on this comparison reported on forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ), either as per cent predicted (% predicted) or L. We were able to combine the data from two trials in a metaâ€analysis which showed a greater per cent change from baseline in FEV 1  L after betaâ€2 agonists compared to placebo (mean difference (MD) 6.95%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.88 to 12.02; 2 trials, 82 participants). Only one of the longerâ€term trials reported on exacerbations, as measured by hospitalisations and courses of antibiotics. Only the second longerâ€term trial presented results for participantâ€reported outcomes. Three trials narratively reported adverse events, and these were all mild. Three singleâ€dose trials and the two longer trials reported on forced vital capacity (FVC), and five trials reported on peak expiratory flow, i.e. forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% (FEF 25-75 ). One trial reported on airway clearance in terms of sputum weight. We judged the certainty of evidence for each of these outcomes to be very low, meaning we are very uncertain about the effect of shortâ€acting inhaled betaâ€2 agonists on any of the outcomes we assessed. Shortâ€acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists versus placebo All four trials reporting on this comparison looked at the effects of ipratropium bromide, but in different doses and via different delivery methods. One trial reported FEV 1  % predicted; three trials measured this in L. Two trials reported adverse events, but these were few and mild. One trial reported FVC and three trials reported FEF 25-75 . None of the trials reported on quality of life, exacerbations or airway clearance. We judged the certainty of evidence for each of these outcomes to be very low, meaning we are very uncertain about the effect of shortâ€acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists on any of the outcomes we assessed. Shortâ€acting inhaled betaâ€2 agonists versus shortâ€acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists  None of the three singleâ€dose trials reporting on this comparison provided data we could analyse. The original papers from three trials report that both treatments lead to an improvement in FEV 1  L. Only one trial reported on adverse events; but none were experienced by any participant. No trial reported on any of our other outcomes. We judged the certainty of evidence to be very low, meaning we are very uncertain about the effect of shortâ€acting inhaled betaâ€2 agonists compared to shortâ€acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists on any of the outcomes we assessed. Authors' conclusions All included trials in this review are small and of a crossâ€over design. Most trials looked at very shortâ€term effects of inhaled bronchodilators, and therefore did not measure longerâ€term outcomes. The certainty of evidence across all outcomes was very low, and therefore we have been unable to describe any effects with certainty. Plain language summary Shortâ€acting inhaled bronchodilators for cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence for using shortâ€acting inhaled bronchodilators (treatments which widen and open the airways, making it easier to breathe) in people with cystic fibrosis. Shortâ€acting bronchodilators take effect quickly and generally last 4 to 6 hours. We were interested in any type of shortâ€acting inhaled bronchodilator, given at any dose, and by any type of device (inhalers or nebulisers). Both nebulisers and inhalers deliver medicine. Nebulisers turn liquid medication into an easilyâ€inhaled mist. They vary in type but need a power source, e.g. a rechargeable battery, to function. Inhalers deliver short bursts of medicine (as an aerosol or dry powder) via a manual handheld device. The most common type of inhaler is a meteredâ€dose inhaler. Inhalers can be used with spacers (empty tubes, usually made from plastic that slot onto the mouthpiece of the inhaler).  Inhaled bronchodilators are used by many people with cystic fibrosis to help them breathe, and to make it easier to clear mucus from their lungs. We wanted to know if these treatments were better than a placebo (dummy) treatment or another type of shortâ€acting inhaled bronchodilator. Search date The evidence is current to 28 March 2022. Trial characteristics The review included 11 trials with 191   people with cystic fibrosis aged between 5   and 40   years of age .  Trials compared two different types of shortâ€acting inhaled bronchodilator (betaâ€2 agonists such as salbutamol or albuterol, and muscarinic antagonists such as ipratropium bromide) against a placebo substance which contained no medication, or a different shortâ€acting inhaled bronchodilator; three of the trials had three comparison groups â€ betaâ€2 agonists versus muscarinic antagonists versus placebo. All trials were crossâ€over trials, so all of the people included in the trial received both treatments at different times, and the order that they received the treatments was random.   The trials lasted from a singleâ€dose trial to 6 months. Eight trials looked at the effects of shortâ€acting inhaled betaâ€2 agonists versus placebo, four trials at the effects of a shortâ€acting inhaled muscarinic antagonist versus placebo, and three trials looked at the effects of a shortâ€acting inhaled betaâ€2 agonist with a shortâ€acting inhaled muscarinic antagonist. Key results All trials looked at the effect of shortâ€acting inhaled bronchodilators on lung function, measured as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ), but this was reported in different ways and at different time points.  We are uncertain whether any of the shortâ€acting inhaled bronchodilators have an effect on FEV 1  compared to placebo. The trials were too small and there were not enough data to show if there was an effect or not. Only six of the 11 trials reported on harmful effects of treatment: one trial reported no harmful effects and five trials reported mild tremors, dry mouth and fatigue. Certainty of the evidence The certainty of the evidence across all trials was very low. All trials used a crossâ€over design where the participants are given one treatment and then swapped to the other treatment with a washout period (the length of time for a drug to be eliminated from the body) in between. It is possible that the clinical status of participants was not the same at the beginning of the first treatment phase as at the beginning of the second treatment phase. The trials were also very small and were carried out more than 10 years ago.",6,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Bronchodilator Agents [therapeutic use]; *Cystic Fibrosis [complications, drug therapy]; Administration, Inhalation; Adult; Child; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Muscarinic Antagonists",10.1002/14651858.CD013666.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013666.pub2,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,4.0

This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the effects of physical activity interventions on exercise capacity by peak oxygen uptake, lung function by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ), healthâ€related quality of life (HRQoL) and further important patientâ€relevant outcomes in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. The most recent search was on 3 March 2022. We also searched two ongoing trials registers: clinicaltrials.gov, most recently on 4 March 2022; and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), most recently on 16 March 2022.  Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasiâ€RCTs comparing physical activity interventions of any type and a minimum intervention duration of two weeks with conventional care (no physical activity intervention) in people with CF. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected RCTs for inclusion, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.  Main results We included 24 parallel RCTs (875 participants). The number of participants in the studies ranged from nine to 117, with a wide range of disease severity. The studies' age demographics varied: in two studies, all participants were adults; in 13 studies, participants were 18 years and younger; in one study, participants were 15 years and older; in one study, participants were 12 years and older; and seven studies included all age ranges. The active training programme lasted up to and including six months in 14 studies, and longer than six months in the remaining 10 studies. Of the 24 included studies, seven implemented a followâ€up period (when supervision was withdrawn, but participants were still allowed to exercise) ranging from one to 12 months. Studies employed differing levels of supervision: in 12 studies, training was supervised; in 11 studies, it was partially supervised; and in one study, training was unsupervised. The quality of the included studies varied widely. This Cochrane Review shows that, in studies with an active training programme lasting over six months in people with CF, physical activity probably has a positive effect on exercise capacity when compared to no physical activity (usual care) (mean difference (MD) 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 3.05; 6 RCTs, 348 participants; moderateâ€certainty evidence). The magnitude of improvement in exercise capacity is interpreted as small, although study results were heterogeneous. Physical activity interventions may have no effect on lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) % predicted) (MD 2.41, 95% CI â€’0.49 to 5.31; 6 RCTs, 367 participants), HRQoL physical functioning (MD 2.19, 95% CI â€’3.42 to 7.80; 4 RCTs, 247 participants) and HRQoL respiratory domain (MD â€’0.05, 95% CI â€’3.61 to 3.51; 4 RCTs, 251 participants) at six months and longer (lowâ€certainty evidence). One study (117 participants) reported no differences between the physical activity and control groups in the number of participants experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation by six months (incidence rate ratio 1.28, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.94) or in the time to first exacerbation over 12 months (hazard ratio 1.34, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.80) (both highâ€certainty evidence); and no effects of physical activity on diabetic control (after 1 hour: MD â€’0.04 mmol/L, 95% CI â€’1.11 to 1.03; 67 participants; after 2 hours: MD â€’0.44 mmol/L, 95% CI â€’1.43 to 0.55; 81 participants; moderateâ€certainty evidence). We found no difference between groups in the number of adverse events over six months (odds ratio 6.22, 95% CI 0.72 to 53.40; 2 RCTs, 156 participants; lowâ€certainty evidence). For other time points (up to and including six months and during a followâ€up period with no active intervention), the effects of physical activity versus control were similar to those reported for the outcomes above. However, only three out of seven studies adding a followâ€up period with no active intervention (ranging between one and 12 months) reported on the primary outcomes of changes in exercise capacity and lung function, and one on HRQoL. These data must be interpreted with caution. Altogether, given the heterogeneity of effects across studies, the wide variation in study quality and lack of information on clinically meaningful changes for several outcome measures, we consider the overall certainty of evidence on the effects of physical activity interventions on exercise capacity, lung function and HRQoL to be low to moderate. Authors' conclusions Physical activity interventions for six months and longer likely improve exercise capacity when compared to no training (moderateâ€certainty evidence). Current evidence shows little or no effect on lung function and HRQoL (lowâ€certainty evidence). Over recent decades, physical activity has gained increasing interest and is already part of multidisciplinary care offered to most people with CF. Adverse effects of physical activity appear rare and there is no reason to actively discourage regular physical activity and exercise. The benefits of including physical activity in an individual's regular care may be influenced by the type and duration of the activity programme as well as individual preferences for and barriers to physical activity. Further highâ€quality and sufficientlyâ€sized studies are needed to comprehensively assess the benefits of physical activity and exercise in people with CF, particularly in the new era of CF medicine. Plain language summary Physical activity to improve exercise capacity in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about whether physical activity interventions (including exercise) have any effect on exercise capacity, healthâ€related quality of life and lung function in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). This is an update of a previously published review. Background CF affects many systems in the body, but mainly the lungs. It causes shortness of breath and limits the amount of exercise people with CF can tolerate. The progress of lung disease leads to a low ability to exercise and to physical inactivity, which in turn affects health and healthâ€related quality of life. We looked for studies where people with CF engaged in a physical activity intervention (including enduranceâ€type activities such as walking, jogging, swimming and cycling; or resistance training; or combinations of both) compared to a control group with no intervention (usual care). Search date The evidence is current to 3 March 2022. Study characteristics We included 24 studies (875 participants) in this review. The number of people in each study ranged from nine to 117. Some studies included only children, others only adults, and some both children and adults. The studies included people with a wide range of disease severity. The studies used differing levels of supervision in their active training programmes: in 12 studies, participants were supervised; in 11 studies, participants were partially supervised; and in one study, participants were not supervised at all. The active training programme lasted up to and including six months in 14 studies, and longer than six months in the remaining 10 studies. Of the 24 included studies, seven added on a followâ€up period (when all participants reverted to usual care, but were still allowed to exercise if they wished). The quality of the included studies varied widely. Key results This systematic review shows that physical activity interventions for longer than six months probably improve exercise capacity in people with CF. When compared with no activity, physical activity interventions may make little or no difference to lung function and healthâ€related quality of life. The largest study included in this review (117 participants) reported: â€ no differences between the physical activity and control groups in the number of pulmonary exacerbations (a flare up of disease) (highâ€certainty evidence); â€ no differences in the time to the first flare up for 12 months (highâ€certainty evidence); â€ no beneficial effects of physical activity on diabetic control after nine months (moderateâ€certainty evidence). Two studies (156 participants) found no differences between groups in the number of reported adverse events (lowâ€certainty evidence). For active training programmes lasting up to and including six months, the effects were similar to the longer programmes.  Only three studies which added a followâ€up period (of varying durations) reported data we could analyse on changes in exercise capacity and lung function; and only one reported on quality of life. These results must be interpreted with caution.  Overall and when compared to usual care (no intervention), physical activity and exercise training probably lead to slightly better exercise capacity, while they may have little or no effect on lung function and healthâ€related quality of life in people with CF. Certainty of the evidence We included 24 studies. Given the differences in effects across studies, the wide variation in study quality and the lack of information on clinically meaningful changes for several outcome measures, we consider the overall certainty of the evidence on the effects of physical activity interventions on exercise capacity, lung function and healthâ€related quality of life as low to moderate. We are uncertain about the effects we have seen and betterâ€quality studies will likely change these findings. Factors affecting our certainty included that, in five studies, the characteristics of some of the people taking part were different between groups at the start of the studies, despite people being put into the different treatment groups at random. Also, when comparing physical activity interventions to no intervention, people will always know which group they are in. However, we do not think the fact that people knew which treatment they were receiving would affect the results for lung function, as long as the assessments were done properly. In contrast, some bias may be introduced when investigators assessing a person's exercise capacity know to which group the person belongs. Investigators tried to prevent the outcome assessors from knowing to which groups the participants belonged in 10 included studies. Selective reporting of results may also be an issue, especially as most of the included studies were not listed in trial registries, where details of the outcomes are reported.",8,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,*Cystic Fibrosis [drug therapy]; Adolescent; Adult; Exercise; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Quality of Life,10.1002/14651858.CD002768.pub5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002768.pub5,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,376.0
CD013285.PUB2,"Heinz, KD; Walsh, A; Southern, KW; Johnstone, Z; Regan, KH",Exercise versus airway clearance techniques for people with cystic fibrosis,2022,"Abstract - Background There are many accepted airway clearance techniques (ACTs) for managing the respiratory health of people with cystic fibrosis (CF); none of which demonstrate superiority. Other Cochrane Reviews have reported shortâ€term effects related to mucus transport, but no evidence supporting longâ€term benefits. Exercise is an alternative ACT thought to produce shearing forces within the lung parenchyma, which enhances mucociliary clearance and the removal of viscous secretions. Recent evidence suggests that some people with CF are using exercise as a substitute for traditional ACTs, yet there is no agreed recommendation for this. Additionally, one of the top 10 research questions identified by people with CF is whether exercise can replace other ACTs. Systematically reviewing the evidence for exercise as a safe and effective ACT will help people with CF decide whether to incorporate this strategy into their treatment plans and potentially reduce their treatment burden. The timing of this review is especially pertinent given the shifting landscape of CF management with the advent of highlyâ€effective small molecule therapies, which are changing the way people with CF are cared for. Objectives To compare the effect of exercise to other ACTs for improving respiratory function and other clinical outcomes in people with CF and to assess the potential adverse effects associated with this ACT. Search methods On 28 February 2022, we searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. We searched online clinical trial registries on 15 February 2022. We emailed authors of studies awaiting classification or potentially eligible abstracts for additional information on 1 February 2021. Selection criteria We selected randomised controlled studies (RCTs) and quasiâ€RCTs comparing exercise to another ACT in people with CF for at least two treatment sessions. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias for the included studies. They assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Review authors contacted investigators for further relevant information regarding their publications. Main results We included four RCTs. The 86 participants had a wide range of disease severity (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) ranged from 54% to 95%) and were 7 to 41 years old. Two RCTs were crossâ€over and two were parallel in design. Participants in one RCT were hospitalised with an acute respiratory exacerbation, whilst the participants in three RCTs were clinically stable. All four RCTs compared exercise either alone or in combination with another ACT, but these were too diverse to allow us to combine results. The certainty of the evidence was very low; we downgraded it due to low participant numbers and high or unclear risks of bias across all domains. Exercise versus active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) One crossâ€over trial (18 participants) compared exercise alone to ACBT. There was no change from baseline in our primary outcome FEV 1 , although it increased in the exercise group before returning to baseline after 30 minutes; we are unsure if exercise affected FEV 1  as the evidence is very lowâ€certainty. Similar results were seen for other measures of lung function. No adverse events occurred during the exercise sessions (very lowâ€certainty evidence). We are unsure if ACBT was perceived to be more effective or was the preferred ACT (very lowâ€certainty evidence). 24â€hour sputum volume was less in the exercise group than with ACBT (secondary outcome). Exercise capacity, quality of life, adherence, hospitalisations and need for additional antibiotics were not reported. Exercise plus postural drainage and percussion (PD&P) versus PD&P only Two trials (55 participants) compared exercise and PD&P to PD&P alone. At two weeks, one trial narratively reported a greater increase in FEV 1  % predicted with PD&P alone. At six months, the other trial reported a greater increase with exercise combined with PD&P, but did not provide data for the PD&P group. We are uncertain whether exercise with PD&P improves FEV 1  as the certainty of evidence is very low. Other measures of lung function did not show clear evidence of effect. One trial reported no difference in exercise capacity (maximal work rate) after two weeks. No adverse events were reported (1 trial, 17 participants; very lowâ€certainty evidence). Adherence was high, with all PD&P sessions and 96% of exercise sessions completed (1 trial, 17 participants; very lowâ€certainty evidence). There was no difference between groups in 24â€hour sputum volume or in the mean duration of hospitalisation, although the sixâ€month trial reported fewer hospitalisations due to exacerbations in the exercise and PD&P group. Quality of life, ACT preference and need for antibiotics were not reported. Exercise versus underwater positive expiratory pressure (uPEP) One trial (13 participants) compared exercise to uPEP (also known as bubble PEP). No adverse events were recorded in either group (very lowâ€certainty evidence). Trial investigators reported that participants perceived exercise as more fatiguing but also more enjoyable than bubble PEP (very lowâ€certainty evidence). There were no differences found in the total weight of sputum collected during treatment sessions. The trial did not report the primary outcomes (FEV 1 , quality of life, exercise capacity) or the secondary outcomes (other measures of lung function, adherence, need for antibiotics or hospitalisations). Authors' conclusions As one of the top 10 research questions identified by clinicians and people with CF, it is important to systematically review the literature regarding whether or not exercise is an acceptable and effective ACT, and whether it can replace traditional methods. We identified an insufficient number of trials to conclude whether or not exercise is a suitable alternative ACT, and the diverse design of included trials did not allow for metaâ€analysis of results. The evidence is very lowâ€certainty, so we are uncertain about the effectiveness of exercise as an ACT. Longer studies examining outcomes that are important to people with CF are required to answer this question. Plain language summary Exercise versus airway clearance for people with cystic fibrosis Review question Can exercise replace other methods of airway clearance for people with cystic fibrosis (CF)? Background CF affects many systems in the body, mainly the respiratory system. It causes a buildâ€up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs which causes irritation and damage to the lining of the airways. CF treatment involves chest physiotherapy, also called airway clearance, which uses a range of devices or techniques to get rid of this mucus. It has been suggested that exercise may have a similar effect. Exercising results in a person taking different volumes and depths of breaths. This leads to pressure changes and forces within the airways that move secretions out of the lungs. We compared the effect on lung function of exercise versus other techniques, to see if exercise is a suitable alternative for people with CF. We wanted to answer our review question to potentially reduce their treatment burden. Search date The evidence is current to 15 February 2022. Study characteristics We searched the literature for studies where people received at least two treatment sessions of exercise or another airway clearance technique, and report on four studies including 86 people with CF in the review. The people in the studies were aged between 7 and 41 years and had varying degrees of disease severity. Three studies included people who were clinically well and one study included people admitted to hospital for a chest infection. The studies lasted between four days and six months and compared exercise (alone or in combination with another airway clearance technique) to other techniques. Two studies compared exercise with postural drainage and percussion (PD&P), one study compared exercise with the active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) and one study compared exercise with underwater positive expiratory pressure (uPEP), also known as bubble PEP. Three studies received financial support from funding bodies such as the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, the Buffalo Foundation and the Romanian National Council for Scientific Research in Higher Education. Key results We did not find enough evidence to conclude whether or not exercise can replace other methods of airway clearance. We did not find any evidence to suggest that exercise was either better or worse than other methods to improve lung function or clear mucus from the airways, although exercising did improve people's exercise ability, and it was the preferred choice of treatment in one study. None of the studies reported any negative effects of exercise therapy. None of the studies evaluated quality of life or the need for extra antibiotic treatment. One study did suggest that exercise alone was less effective at clearing sputum than ACBT. Exercise versus ACBT One study (18 participants) found that a measure of lung function temporarily (up to 30 minutes) increased in the exercise group only, otherwise there was no difference between the ACBT or the exercise group. No adverse events were reported, and it is not certain if ACBT was thought to be more effective or was preferred. The exercise group produced less sputum than the ACBT group. The study did not report on exercise capacity, quality of life, adherence, hospitalisations and need for additional antibiotics. Exercise plus PD&P versus PD&P alone Two studies (55 participants) compared exercise plus PD&P to PD&P alone. At two weeks, one trial described a greater increase in lung function with PD&P alone, while at six months the second study reported a greater increase with exercise plus PD&P (but did not provide data for the PD&P group). One study reported no side effects at all, and also reported no difference between groups in exercise capacity (maximal work rate), sputum volume or the average length of time spent in hospital. Conversely, the second study reported fewer hospitalisations due to exacerbations in the exercise and PD&P group. Neither study reported on quality of life, preference and the need for antibiotics. Exercise versus uPEP One study (13 participants) compared exercise to uPEP (also known as bubble PEP). No adverse events were recorded in either group and investigators reported that those taking part thought that, while exercise was more tiring, it was also more enjoyable than bubble PEP. We found no differences in the total weight of sputum collected during treatment sessions. The study did not report on lung function, quality of life, exercise capacity, adherence, need for antibiotics or hospitalisations. Certainty of the evidence Overall, we had very little confidence in the evidence because all four studies had few participants and two studies only presented results as a shortened report given at a conference.  We do not think the fact that participants and people measuring the outcomes knew which treatment the participants were receiving influenced the results of outcomes such as lung function and sputum weight. We do not think the fact that these studies were financed should influence the interpretation of the results in this review.

CD012979.PUB3,"Karanth, TK; Karanth, VKKL; Ward, BK; Woodworth, BA; Karanth, L",Medical interventions for chronic rhinosinusitis in cystic fibrosis,2022,"Abstract - Background Chronic rhinosinusitis frequently occurs in people with cystic fibrosis. Several medical interventions are available for treating chronic rhinosinusitis in people with cystic fibrosis; for example, different concentrations of nasal saline irrigations, topical or oral corticosteroids, antibiotics â€ including nebulized antibiotics â€ dornase alfa and modulators of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (such as lumacaftor, ivacaftor or tezacaftor). However, the efficacy of these interventions is unclear. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives The objective of this review is to compare the effects of different medical interventions in people diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and chronic rhinosinusitis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and hand searching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of last search of trials register: 09 September 2021. We also searched ongoing trials databases, other medical databases and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of latest additional searches: 22 November 2021. Selection criteria Randomized and quasiâ€randomized trials of different medical interventions compared to each other or to no intervention or to placebo. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials identified for potential inclusion in the review. We planned to conduct data collection and analysis in accordance with Cochrane methods and to independently rate the quality of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE guidelines. Main results We identified no trials that met the preâ€defined inclusion criteria. The most recent searches identified 44 new references, none of which were eligible for inclusion in the current version of this review; 12 studies are listed as excluded and one as ongoing. Authors' conclusions We identified no eligible trials assessing the medical interventions in people with cystic fibrosis and chronic rhinosinusitis. Highâ€quality trials are needed which should assess the efficacy of different treatment options detailed above for managing chronic rhinosinusitis, preventing pulmonary exacerbations and improving quality of life in people with cystic fibrosis. Plain language summary Medical interventions for chronic inflammation of the nose and sinuses in cystic fibrosis Review question What are the effects of medical interventions for chronic rhinosinusitis on people with cystic fibrosis? Background Chronic rhinosinusitis is longâ€term infection and inflammation of the nasal cavity and airâ€filled spaces around the eyes and nose. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition that makes secretions in the body thick, and hence stagnant. When this occurs in and around the nose, it causes chronic rhinosinusitis. Better care of people with cystic fibrosis has led to them living longer, increasing the chance of developing chronic rhinosinusitis. Early and effective interventions with antibiotics, steroids, drugs that thin the mucus (e.g. dornase alfa) and drugs to improve how the cell membrane channel functions (CFTR modulators) can help to improve quality of life and prevent the development of lower airway disease. Currently, there are no guidelines based on trials to know how best to treat chronic rhinosinusitis in people with cystic fibrosis. Search date The evidence is current to: 09 September 2021. Study characteristics We found no trials in our search that met our inclusion criteria. We have listed 12 trials as excluded and one trial as ongoing in the current review. Key results Although chronic rhinosinusitis is common in people with cystic fibrosis, there is not enough evidence available on its management. This review highlights the need for wellâ€designed trials assessing which treatment is best for managing chronic rhinosinusitis, preventing lower airway disease and improving quality of life in people with cystic fibrosis.",4,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,"*Cystic Fibrosis [drug therapy, therapy]; *Sinusitis [complications, drug therapy]; Anti-Bacterial Agents [therapeutic use]; Chronic Disease; Humans; Quality of Life",10.1002/14651858.CD012979.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012979.pub3,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,23.0
CD008190.PUB3,"McTavish, D; Thornton, J",Appetite stimulants for people with cystic fibrosis,2022,"Abstract - Background Chronic loss of appetite in cystic fibrosis concerns both individuals and families. Appetite stimulants have been used to help cystic fibrosis patients with chronic anorexia attain optimal body mass index (BMI) and nutritional status. However, these may have adverse effects on clinical status. This is an updated version of the original review. Objectives To systematically search for and evaluate the evidence on the beneficial effects of appetite stimulants in the management of cystic fibrosisâ€related anorexia and synthesise reports of any side effects. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register and online trials registries; handsearched reference lists; and contacted local and international experts to identify relevant trials. Last search of the Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 23 May 2022. Last search of online trial registries: 10 May 2022. Selection criteria Randomised and quasiâ€randomised controlled trials of appetite stimulants compared to placebo, control, no treatment or different appetite stimulants, or to the same appetite stimulants at different doses or regimens for at least one month in adults and children with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the included trials. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence and performed metaâ€analyses. Main results We included four trials (70 participants) comparing appetite stimulants (cyproheptadine hydrochloride and megestrol acetate) to placebo; the numbers of adults or children within each trial were not always reported. We assessed the certainty of evidence as low due to the small number of participants, incomplete or selective outcome reporting, and unclear risk of selection bias.  Regarding our primary outcomes, a metaâ€analysis of two trials (42 participants) showed that appetite stimulants may produce a larger increase in weight (kg) at three months (mean difference (MD) 1.25 kg, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 0.45 to 2.05), and one trial (17 participants) showed a similar result at six months (MD 3.80 kg, 95% CI 1.27 to 6.33) (both lowâ€certainty evidence). Results also showed that weight z score may increase with appetite stimulants compared to placebo at three months (MD 0.61, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.93; 3 studies; 40 participants; P < 0.001) and at six months (MD 0.74, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.22; 1 trial; 17 participants). There was no evidence of a difference in effect between cyproheptadine hydrochloride and megestrol acetate for either outcome.   Only one trial (25 participants) reported analysable data for body composition (BMI), with results favouring cyproheptadine hydrochloride compared to placebo; a further trial (16 participants) narratively agreed with this result. All four trials reported on lung function at durations ranging from two to nine months. Considering analysable data, two trials (42 participants) found that appetite stimulants may make little or no difference in forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV 1 ) % predicted at three months, and one trial (17 participants) found similar results at six months. Two further threeâ€month trials narratively agreed with these results. Limited information was reported for secondary outcomes. Two trials (23 participants) reported results showing that appetite stimulants may increase appetite compared to placebo at three months (odds ratio 45.25, 95% CI 3.57 to 573.33; lowâ€certainty evidence).  Only one study reported on quality of life, finding that cyproheptadine reduced fatigue in two participants compared with none with placebo. One study (25 participants) found no difference in energy intake between appetite stimulant or placebo at three months. Insufficient reporting of adverse effects prevented a full determination of their impact. Two studies (33 participants) narratively reported similar requirements for additional antibiotics between appetite stimulants and placebo at three months.  Authors' conclusions At six months in adults and children, appetite stimulants improved only two of the outcomes of this review: weight (or weight z score) and subjectively reported appetite. Insufficient reporting of side effects prevented a full determination of their impact. Whilst the data may suggest the potential use of appetite stimulants in treating anorexia in adults and children with cystic fibrosis, this is based upon lowâ€certainty evidence from a small number of trials, therefore firm conclusions cannot be drawn. Clinicians need to be aware of the potential adverse effects of appetite stimulants and actively monitor any individuals prescribed these medications accordingly. Research is required to determine meaningful surrogate measures for appetite and to define what constitutes quality weight gain. Future trials of appetite stimulants should use a validated measure of symptoms including a diseaseâ€specific instrument for measuring poor appetite. This review highlights the need for multicentred, adequately powered, and wellâ€designed trials to evaluate agents to safely increase appetite in people with cystic fibrosis and to establish the optimal mode of treatment. Plain language summary Appetite stimulants for people with cystic fibrosis Review question We looked for evidence on both beneficial and adverse effects of using appetite stimulants in people with anorexia linked to cystic fibrosis. Background Loss of appetite in people with cystic fibrosis concerns both those with the disease and their families. Appetite stimulants have been used to help people with cystic fibrosis who have a poor appetite to increase the amounts they eat so they gain weight and improve their overall health. However, there are concerns that appetite stimulants can cause side effects. This is an updated version of the original review. Search date We last looked for evidence on 23 May 2022. Study characteristics We included four trials (70 participants), two of which were performed in children and two in both children and adults. The trials looked at the effects of drugs (megestrol acetate and cyproheptadine hydrochloride) compared to a placebo (a tablet that contained no medicine) to stimulate appetite. The trials lasted between three and six months. Key results We found that these drugs may improve weight and appetite in the short term (up to six months). No effect was seen on lung function. All stimulants can have adverse effects which can worsen cystic fibrosis, such as effects on blood sugar control, fatigue, mood, fluid retention, the liver, and shortness of breath, but unfortunately insufficient reporting of side effects prevented a full understanding of their effects. The included trials were too small to show if megestrol acetate and cyproheptadine hydrochloride can improve weight and appetite safely. Whilst there is evidence to suggest that appetite stimulants may improve weight and poor appetite in adults and children with cystic fibrosis, we believe more research is needed to identify appropriate ways of measuring appetite, and then to collect sound data from enough patients to find out if appetite stimulants can improve appetite safely in cystic fibrosis. Certainty of the evidence We have low confidence in the results being able to show the true effectiveness of appetite stimulants. We came to this conclusion because although we think that most of the people taking part had the same chance of being in the appetite stimulant or placebo group, and no one could not tell the difference between the appetite stimulant or the placebo, there may be some bias due to the small numbers of participants in the studies, and because in two studies some participants withdrew without clear reasons being given. Another possible source of bias is that three studies did not report on all of their preâ€planned outcomes.

CD014605.PUB2,"Pinto, ACPereira Nunes; Piva, SR; Rocha, A; Gomes-Neto, M; Atallah, ÃN; Saconato, H; Trevisani, VFM",Digital technology for delivering and monitoring exercise programs for people with cystic fibrosis,2023,"Abstract - Background Although exercise is recommended as part of the cystic fibrosis (CF) therapeutic routine, adherence to exercise is still limited. Digital health technologies can provide easyâ€toâ€access health information and may help improve healthcare and outcomes in individuals with longâ€term conditions. However, its effects for delivering and monitoring exercise programs in CF have not yet been synthesized. Objectives To evaluate the benefits and harms of digital health technologies for delivering and monitoring exercise programs, increasing adherence to exercise regimens, and improving key clinical outcomes in people with CF. Search methods We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 21 November 2022. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasiâ€RCTs of digital health technologies for delivering or monitoring exercise programs in CF. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. physical activity, 2. selfâ€management behavior, and 3. pulmonary exacerbations. Our secondary outcomes were 4. usability of technologies, 5. quality of life, 6. lung function, 7. muscle strength, 8. exercise capacity, 9. physiologic parameters, and 10. adverse events. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. Main results We identified four parallel RCTs (three singleâ€center and one multicenter with 231 participants aged six years or older). The RCTs evaluated different modes of digital health technologies with distinct purposes, combined with diverse interventions. We identified important methodologic concerns in the RCTs, including insufficient information on the randomization process, blinding of outcome assessors, balance of nonâ€protocol interventions across groups, and whether the analyses performed corrected for bias due to missing outcome data. Nonâ€reporting of results may also be a concern, especially because some planned outcome results were reported incompletely. Furthermore, each trial had a small number of participants, resulting in imprecise effects. These limitations on the risk of bias, and on the precision of effect estimates resulted in overall lowâ€ to very lowâ€certainty evidence. We undertook four comparisons and present the findings for our primary outcomes below. There is no information on the effectiveness of other modes of digital health technologies for monitoring physical activity or delivering exercise programs in people with CF, on adverse events related to the use of digital health technologies either for delivering or monitoring exercise programs in CF, and on their longâ€term effects (more than one year). Digital health technologies for monitoring physical activity Wearable fitness tracker plus personalized exercise prescription compared to personalized exercise prescription alone One trial (40 adults with CF) evaluated this outcome, but did not report data for any of our primary outcomes. Wearable fitness tracker plus text message for personalized feedback and goal setting compared to wearable fitness tracker alone The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of a wearable fitness tracker plus text message for personalized feedback and goal setting, compared to wearable technology alone on physical activity measured by step count at sixâ€month followâ€up (mean difference [MD] 675.00 steps, 95% confidence interval [CI] âˆ’2406.37 to 3756.37; 1 trial, 32 participants). The same study measured pulmonary exacerbation rates and reported finding no difference between groups. Webâ€based application to record, monitor, and set goals on physical activity plus usual care compared to usual care alone Using a webâ€based application to record, monitor, and set goals on physical activity plus usual care may result in little to no difference on time spent in moderateâ€toâ€vigorous physical activity measured via accelerometry compared to usual care alone at sixâ€month followâ€up (MD âˆ’4 minutes/day, 95% CI âˆ’37 to 29; 1 trial, 63 participants). Low certaintyâ€evidence from the same trial suggests that the intervention may result in little to no difference on pulmonary exacerbations during 12 months of followâ€up (median 1 respiratory hospitalization, interquartile range [IQR] 0 to 3) versus control (median 1 respiratory hospitalization, IQR 0 to 2; P = 0.6). Digital health technologies for delivering exercise programs Webâ€based versus faceâ€toâ€face exercise delivery The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of webâ€based compared to faceâ€toâ€face exercise delivery on adherence to physical activity as assessed by the number of participants who completed all exercise sessions after three months of intervention (risk ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.23; 1 trial, 51 participants). Authors' conclusions The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of an exercise program plus the use of a wearable fitness tracker integrated with a social media platform compared with exercise prescription alone and on the effects of receiving a wearable fitness tracker plus text message for personalized feedback and goal setting, compared to a wearable fitness tracker alone. Lowâ€certainty evidence suggests that using a webâ€based application to record, monitor, and set goals on physical activity plus usual care may result in little to no difference in time spent in moderateâ€toâ€vigorous physical activity, total time spent in activity, pulmonary exacerbations, quality of life, lung function, and exercise capacity compared to usual care alone. Regarding the use of digital health technologies for delivering exercise programs in CF, the evidence is very uncertain about the effects of using a wearable fitness tracker plus personalized exercise prescription compared to personalized exercise prescription alone. Further highâ€quality RCTs, with blinded outcome assessors, reporting the effects of digital health technologies on clinically important outcome measures, such as physical activity participation and intensity, selfâ€management behavior, and the occurrence of pulmonary exacerbations in the long term are needed. The results of six ongoing RCTs identified through our searches may help clarify the effects of different modes of digital health technologies for delivering and monitoring exercise programs in people with CF. Plain language summary Digital interventions for delivering exercise in people with Cystic Fibrosis Review question What are the benefits and risks of using digital interventions for delivering or monitoring, or both, physical activity in people with cystic fibrosis (CF)? Key messages Taken together, the results of these trials suggest the following. â€“ Using a webâ€based application to record, monitor, and set goals on physical activity plus usual care may result in little to no difference on physical activity and pulmonary exacerbations (flare up of disease) compared to usual care alone. â€“ The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of an exercise program plus the use of a wearable fitness tracker integrated with a social media platform plus exercise prescription, compared with exercise prescription alone, and on the effects of receiving a wearable fitness tracker plus text message for personalized feedback and goal setting, compared to a wearable fitness tracker alone. â€“ We are very uncertain about the effects of webâ€based compared to faceâ€toâ€face exercise delivery. What is digital health technology? When we talk about digital interventions, we mean using technology to allow communication and the sending of information between an individual and a healthcare provider to help manage a person's condition remotely. This can be done by mobile phone, tablet computer applications, or other types of technologies. What is CF? CF is an inherited disease that causes problems with the lungs, digestive system, and other organs. People with CF have thick and sticky mucus that blocks airways, leads to lung damage, and makes infections more likely. Most people with CF have respiratory symptoms such as coughing with more mucus and shortness of breath. How digital health technologies can help people with CF? A sedentary lifestyle may contribute to the progression of physical and functional impairment in people with CF, so exercise is recommended as part of the CF treatment plan. However, not everyone sticks to the exercise plan as they should. We wanted to see if digital technology can help people with CF to exercise and if it can keep track of the exercise they do. What did we want to find out? How can digital health technologies help deliver and monitor exercise programs in adults and children with CF? What did we do? To answer this question, we searched medical databases for all relevant trials on the topic. We collected and analyzed all the data currently available from the trials. What did we find? We found four trials involving 231 participants (aged six years or older). The trials lasted from three months to one year. These trials used different types of digital interventions. While one trial used a digital intervention to deliver an exercise program, the other three used a digital intervention to monitor people's physical activity. Main results One trial used a webâ€based application to record, monitor, and set goals on physical activity plus usual care and investigators found there may be little to no difference on the amount of physical activity undertaken or on the number of pulmonary exacerbations that people experienced compared to usual care alone. We are not confident in the results of the trial looking at whether a wearable fitness tracker with an exercise prescription can provide important benefits to people with CF compared to using only exercise prescription. We also cannot be sure whether using a wearable fitness tracker plus text message for personalized feedback and goal setting is effective compared to a wearable fitness tracker alone. Furthermore, we are very uncertain on the effects of webâ€based compared to faceâ€toâ€face exercise delivery. No trials formally evaluated whether digital interventions could lead to harms and we found little or no data on other important outcomes such as participation in physical activity, selfâ€management behavior (the ability to manage our actions), and the occurrence of pulmonary exacerbations. There is no information on the effectiveness of other types of digital health technologies for monitoring physical activity or delivering exercise programs in people with CF, and on their longâ€term effects (more than one year). What are the limitations of the evidence? We included only four trials, each with a small number of participants. The authors of these trials reported little information on how they were conducted. This decreased our confidence in their results. There may be bias when the people assessing a person's test results know which treatment the person received. In the included trials, it was not clear if the investigators tried to prevent the outcome assessors from knowing each person's treatment. Some trials also did not report in full the results that they planned in their protocol and this may also introduce bias. Therefore, we are uncertain about the effects of digital interventions for monitoring and delivering exercise in people with CF, and further betterâ€quality trials are needed to clarify its effects. Overall, we had only low to very low confidence in the results. How up to date is this evidence?

CD001506.PUB5,"Wark, P; McDonald, VM; Smith, S",Nebulised hypertonic saline for cystic fibrosis,2023,"Abstract - Background Hypertonic saline enhances mucociliary clearance and may lessen the destructive inflammatory process in the airways. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To investigate efficacy and tolerability of nebulised hypertonic saline treatment in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) compared to placebo or other treatments that enhance mucociliary clearance. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched ongoing trials databases. Most recent search: 25 April 2022. Selection criteria We included randomised and quasiâ€randomised controlled trials assessing hypertonic saline compared to placebo or other mucolytic therapy, for any duration or dose regimen in people with CF (any age or disease severity). Data collection and analysis Two authors independently reviewed all identified trials and data, and assessed trial quality. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. For crossâ€over trials we stipulated a oneâ€week washout period. We planned to use results from a paired analysis in the review, but this was only possible in one trial. For other crossâ€over trials, we chose to treat the trials as if they were parallel. Main results We included 24 trials (1318 participants, aged one month to 56 years); we excluded 29 trials, two trials are ongoing and six are awaiting classification. We judged 15 of the 24 included trials to have a high risk of bias due to participants' ability to discern the taste of the solutions. Hypertonic saline 3% to 7% versus placebo (stable disease) We are uncertain whether the regular use of nebulised hypertonic saline in stable lung disease leads to an improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) % predicted at four weeks, (mean difference (MD) 3.30%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 5.89; 4 trials, 246 participants; very lowâ€certainty evidence). In preschool children we found no difference in lung clearance index (LCI) at four weeks, but a small improvement after 48 weeks of treatment with hypertonic saline compared to isotonic saline (MD â€0.60, 95% CI â€1.00 to â€0.19; 2 trials, 192 participants). We are also uncertain whether hypertonic saline made a difference to mucociliary clearance, pulmonary exacerbations or adverse events compared to placebo. Hypertonic saline versus control (acute exacerbation) Two trials compared hypertonic saline to control, but only one provided data. There may be little or no difference in lung function measured by FEV 1  % predicted after hypertonic saline compared to isotonic saline (MD 5.10%, 95% CI â€14.67 to 24.87; 1 trial, 130 participants). Neither trial reported any deaths or measures of sputum clearance. There were no serious adverse events. Hypertonic saline versus rhDNase Three trials compared a similar dose of hypertonic saline to recombinant deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase); two trials (61 participants) provided data for inclusion in the review. We are uncertain whether there was an effect of hypertonic saline on FEV 1  % predicted after three weeks (MD 1.60%, 95% CI â€7.96 to 11.16; 1 trial, 14 participants; very lowâ€certainty evidence). At three months, rhDNase may lead to a greater increase in FEV 1  % predicted than hypertonic saline (5 mL twice daily) at 12 weeks in participants with moderate to severe lung disease (MD 8.00%, 95% CI 2.00 to 14.00; lowâ€certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether adverse events differed between the two treatments. No deaths were reported. Hypertonic saline versus amiloride One trial (12 participants) compared hypertonic saline to amiloride but did not report on most of our outcomes. The trial found that there was no difference between treatments in measures of sputum clearance (very lowâ€certainty evidence). Hypertonic saline compared with sodiumâ€2â€mercaptoethane sulphonate (MistabronÂ®) One trial (29 participants) compared hypertonic saline to sodiumâ€2â€mercaptoethane sulphonate. The trial did not measure our primary outcomes. There was no difference between treatments in any measures of sputum clearance, courses of antibiotics or adverse events (very lowâ€certainty evidence). Hypertonic saline versus mannitol One trial (12 participants) compared hypertonic saline to mannitol, but did not report lung function at relevant time points for this review; there were no differences in sputum clearance, but mannitol was reported to be more 'irritating' (very lowâ€certainty evidence). Hypertonic saline versus xylitol Two trials compared hypertonic saline to xylitol, but we are uncertain whether there is any difference in FEV 1  % predicted or median time to exacerbation between groups (very lowâ€certainty evidence). No other outcomes were reported in the review. Hypertonic saline 7% versus hypertonic saline 3% We are uncertain whether there was an improvement in FEV 1  % predicted after treatment with 7% hypertonic saline compared with 3% (very lowâ€certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions We are very uncertain if regular use of nebulised hypertonic saline by adults and children over the age of 12 years with CF results in an improvement in lung function after four weeks (three trials; very lowâ€certainty evidence); there was no difference seen at 48 weeks (one trial; lowâ€certainty evidence). Hypertonic saline improved LCI modestly in children under the age of six years. Evidence from one small crossâ€over trial in children indicates that rhDNase may lead to better lung function than hypertonic saline at three months; qualifying this, we highlight that while the study did demonstrate that the improvement in FEV 1  was greater with daily rhDNase, there were no differences seen in any of the secondary outcomes. Hypertonic saline does appear to be an effective adjunct to physiotherapy during acute exacerbations of lung disease in adults. However, for the outcomes assessed, the certainty of the evidence ranged from very low to low at best, according to the GRADE criteria. The role of hypertonic saline in conjunction with cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapy now needs to be considered, and future research needs to focus on this aspect. Plain language summary Hypertonic saline (salt water with at least 3% salt) nebulised as a fine mist through a mask or mouthpiece for cystic fibrosis Review question Is inhaling hypertonic saline (salt water with at least 3% salt) as a mist through a mask or mouthpiece better for improving mucus clearance in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) than a placebo (a mist with no or very little salt) or other agents? Background People with CF produce large amounts of thick mucus which is difficult to clear and blocks up their airways. Chest physiotherapy or medication, e.g. hypertonic saline, or both combined, are used to try and clear this mucus from the airways. Hypertonic saline is water with a concentration of 3% to 7% salt and is inhaled as a fine mist. This is an update of an earlier review. Key messages â€¢ We are uncertain whether inhaling nebulised hypertonic saline regularly improves lung function compared to placebo. â€¢ Nebulised hypertonic saline does seem to work well as an addâ€on to physiotherapy. What did we do? We searched for studies that looked at the use of nebulised hypertonic saline compared to either a placebo or a different type of treatment for clearing mucus from the lungs. We compared the size and methods of the studies and stated how confident we were in the results. What did we find? We included 24 trials with 1318 people with CF aged between one month and 56 years. Two thirds of the trials compared hypertonic saline to a placebo (a dummy treatment); the remaining trials compared hypertonic saline to another type of mucus clearing treatment (including mannitol; rhDNase (PulmozymeÂ®); amiloride; MistabronÂ®; xylitol); and one trial compared 7% hypertonic saline with 3% hypertonic saline. Trials assessed different concentrations of hypertonic saline with different nebulisers and different treatment schedules; the most common treatment was twiceâ€daily 7% hypertonic saline and the most common nebuliser was ultrasonic. Most trials treated people with a bronchodilator to widen the airways before giving the hypertonic saline. Main results Hypertonic saline 3% to 7% versus placebo We are not sure whether hypertonic saline leads to an improvement in lung function in stable disease after four weeks. Two trials showed that there may be a small improvement in lung function (measured using the lung clearance index) with hypertonic saline compared to placebo in preschool children. We are also unsure whether hypertonic saline makes a difference to clearing mucus from the lungs, exacerbations or side effects compared to placebo. During exacerbations, we found that there may be little or no difference in lung function after hypertonic saline compared to placebo. The trials did not report any serious side effects and there were no deaths. One study compared 7% hypertonic saline with a lower concentration of hypertonic saline (3%); we are uncertain whether the higher concentration improved lung function. Hypertonic saline versus mucus mobilising treatments Three trials compared hypertonic saline with rhDNase and found that rhDNase may lead to an improvement in lung function compared to hypertonic saline after three months. We are unsure whether there is any difference in side effects. One trial compared hypertonic saline to amiloride and a further trial compared hypertonic saline to sodiumâ€2â€mercaptoethane sulphonate (MistabronÂ®), but neither of the trials gave information about the effect of the treatments on lung function. Similarly, a trial comparing hypertonic saline with mannitol did not give information about the effects on lung function, but they did report that there was no difference between treatments in clearing mucus from the lungs. People taking mannitol said it was more irritating than hypertonic saline. Two trials compared hypertonic saline with xylitol, but we are unsure if there is any difference in lung function and none of our other outcomes were measured. What are the limitations of this evidence? We are not confident in the evidence from these trials. There is a high risk that people knew which treatment they were receiving in half the trials as they could taste the difference between the solutions. Other factors that made us unsure of the results were the small numbers of people taking part in the trials combined with a wide variation in results; also, some trials limited participants to those who could tolerate hypertonic saline or to certain age groups.

CD013610.PUB2,"Jones, M; Moffatt, F; Harvey, A; Ryan, JM",Interventions for improving adherence to airway clearance treatment and exercise in people with cystic fibrosis,2023,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lifeâ€limiting genetic disorder predominantly affecting the lungs and pancreas. Airway clearance techniques (ACTs) and exercise therapy are key components of physiotherapy, which is considered integral in managing CF; however, low adherence is wellâ€documented. Poor physiotherapy adherence may lead to repeated respiratory infections, reduced exercise tolerance, breathlessness, reduced quality of life, malaise and reduced life expectancy, as well as increased use of pharmacology, healthcare access and hospital admission. Therefore, evidenceâ€based strategies to inform clinical practice and improve adherence to physiotherapy may improve quality of life and reduce treatment burden. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions to enhance adherence to airway clearance treatment and exercise therapy in people with CF and their effects on health outcomes, such as pulmonary exacerbations, exercise capacity and healthâ€related quality of life. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of last search: 1 March 2023. We also searched online trials registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 28 March 2023. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasiâ€RCTs of parallel design assessing any intervention aimed at enhancing adherence to physiotherapy in people with CF versus no intervention, another intervention or usual care. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently checked search results for eligible studies and independently extracted data. We used standard procedures recommended by Cochrane and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE system. Main results Two RCTs (77 participants with CF; age range 2 to 20 years; 44 (57%) males) met the inclusion criteria of this review. One study employed an intervention to improve adherence to exercise and the second an intervention to improve adherence to ACT. Both studies measured outcomes at baseline and at three months, but neither study formally assessed our primary outcome of adherence in terms of our planned outcome measures, and results were dependent on selfâ€reported data. Adherence to ACTs One RCT (43 participants) assessed using specificallyâ€composed music alongside ACTs compared to selfâ€selected or no music (usual care). The ACT process consisted of nebuliser inhalation treatment, ACTs and relaxation or antibiotic nebuliser treatment. We graded all evidence as very low certainty. This study reported adherence to ACTs using the Moriskyâ€Green questionnaire and also participants' perception of treatment time and enjoyment, which may influence adherence (outcome not reported specifically in this review). We are uncertain whether participants who received specificallyâ€composed music may be more likely to adhere at six and 12 weeks compared to those who received usual care, risk ratio (RR) 1.75 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 2.86) and RR 1.56 (95% CI 1.01 to 2.40) respectively. There may not be any difference in adherence when comparing specificallyâ€composed music to selfâ€selected music at six weeks, RR 1.21 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.68) or 12 weeks, RR 1.52 (95% CI 0.97 to 2.38); or selfâ€selected music to usual care at six weeks, RR 1.44 (95% CI 0.82 to 2.52) or 12 weeks, RR 1.03 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.86). The music study also reported the number of respiratory infections requiring hospitalisation at 12 weeks, with no difference seen in the risk of hospitalisation between all groups. Adherence to exercise One RCT (24 participants) compared the provision of a manual of aerobic exercises, recommended exercise prescription plus twoâ€weekly followâ€up phone calls to reinforce exercise practice over a period of three months to verbal instructions for aerobic exercise according to the CF centre's protocol. We graded all evidence as very low certainty. We are uncertain whether an educational intervention leads to more participants in the intervention group undertaking increased regular physical activity at three months (selfâ€report), RR 3.67 (95% CI 1.24 to 10.85), and there was no reported difference between groups in the number undertaking physical activity three times per week or undertaking at least 40 minutes of physical activity. No effect was seen on secondary outcome measures of spirometry, exercise capacity or any CF quality of life domains. This study did not report on the frequency of respiratory infections (hospitalised or not) or adverse events. Authors' conclusions We are uncertain whether a musicâ€based motivational intervention may increase adherence to ACTs or affect the risk of hospitalisation for a respiratory infection. We are also uncertain whether an educational intervention increases adherence to exercise or reduces the frequency of respiratory infectionâ€related hospital admission. However, these results are largely based on selfâ€reported data and the impact of strategies to improve adherence to ACT and exercise in children and adolescents with stable CF remains inconclusive. Given that adherence to ACT and exercise therapy are fundamental to the clinical management of people with CF, there is an urgent need for wellâ€designed, largeâ€scale clinical trials in this area, which should conform to the CONSORT statement for standards of reporting and use appropriate, validated outcome measures. Studies should also ensure full disclosure of data for all important clinical outcomes. Plain language summary Which strategies might influence how accurately and how long people with cystic fibrosis complete chest physiotherapy and exercise? Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a progressive and lifeâ€limiting genetic condition that affects many systems in the body, especially the lungs. In the UK, 1 in every 2500 babies is diagnosed with CF. Physiotherapy is a very important part of treatment for people with CF. The two main goals of chest physiotherapy are to clear sticky mucus from the airways to prevent repeated infections and lung damage and to maintain physical fitness through exercise. Chest physiotherapy can help prevent poor health and hospital admissions and may contribute to improving quality of life and life expectancy, but it is often considered a burden. People with CF may have to complete seven or more chest physiotherapy treatments a day, which can be timeâ€consuming, tiring, and disruptive. As a result, people with CF may complete as little as 30% of their chest physiotherapy sessions, with rates often dipping during some stages in a person's life (such as adolescence). Although exercise is often viewed more positively by people with CF, they may not always carry out their exercises because of tiredness, feeling unwell, or a lack of time. We wanted to explore what we can do to encourage people with CF to complete more of their planned chest physiotherapy or exercise. We were interested in a range of possible strategies including leaflets, videos, apps, rewards, motivational tools, exercise games, diaries, and text messages. What did we do? We looked for highâ€quality studies of people with CF (aged seven years and upwards). We planned to include any strategy aimed at improving adherence to chest physiotherapy or exercise compared to no strategy, usual care, or another type of strategy. What did we find? We found only two studies that we could include in our review. One was an educational study to improve adherence to exercise, and the second was a motivational study to increase adherence to chest physiotherapy. In the exercise study (34 participants), those who received a written manual seemed to be more physically active at the end of the study, compared to those who were given verbal advice only, but we are not certain whether this was due to the manual. There were no other differences between groups in terms of quality of life, lung function, or exercise capacity. In the chest physiotherapy study (43 participants), we are uncertain whether listening to speciallyâ€composed music during chest physiotherapy leads to more time spent completing treatments. We did not find that listening to music people chose themselves while doing physiotherapy led to completion of more treatment compared to not listening to any music. We did not find any real difference in hospital admissions due to chest infection between any of the groups. What are the limitations of the evidence? In both studies, the groups were very small and there were problems in trial design and reporting. This means that the reliability of the results might be affected. As a result, the evidence for strategies to improve adherence to physiotherapy and adherence to exercise was very uncertain. Whilst these studies suggest that some strategies may be helpful, future research needs to consider ways to accurately measure adherence. In the meantime, physiotherapists treating people with CF should follow local guidelines and national standards of care related to CF and treatment adherence. How up to date is the evidence?

CD013766.PUB2,"Dawson, S; Girling, C-J; Cowap, L; Clark-Carter, D",Psychological interventions for improving adherence to inhaled therapies in people with cystic fibrosis,2023,"Abstract - Background Adherence to treatment, including inhaled therapies, is low in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Although psychological interventions for improving adherence to inhaled therapies in people with CF have been developed, no previous published systematic review has evaluated the evidence for efficacy of these interventions. Objectives The primary objective of the review was to assess the efficacy of psychological interventions for improving adherence to inhaled therapies in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). The secondary objective was to establish the most effective components, or behaviour change techniques (BCTs), used in these interventions. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, which is compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched databases (PubMed; PsycINFO; EBSCO; Scopus; OpenGrey), trials registries (World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov), and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews, with no restrictions on language, year or publication status. Date of search: 7 August 2022. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different types of psychological interventions for improving adherence to inhaled therapies in people with CF of any age, or comparing psychological interventions with usual care. We included quasiâ€RCTs if we could reasonably assume that the baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and completed data extraction, risk of bias assessments, and BCT coding (using the BCT Taxonomy v1) for all included trials. We resolved any discrepancies by discussion, or by consultation with a third review author as necessary. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Main results We included 10 trials (1642 participants) in the review (children and adolescents in four trials; adults in five trials; and children and adults in one trial). Nine trials compared a psychological intervention with usual care; we could combine data from some of these in a number of quantitative analyses. One trial compared a psychological intervention with an active comparator (education plus problemâ€solving (EPS)). We identified five ongoing trials. Psychological interventions were generally multiâ€component and complex, containing an average of 9.6 BCTs (range 1 to 28). The two most commonly used BCTs included 'problemâ€solving' and 'instruction on how to perform the behaviour'. Interventions varied in their type, content and mode of delivery. They included a problemâ€solving intervention; a paperâ€based selfâ€management workbook; a telehealth intervention; a group training programme; a digital intervention comprising medication reminders and lung function selfâ€monitoring; a lifeâ€coaching intervention; a motivational interviewing (MI) intervention; a brief MI intervention (behaviour change counselling); and a digital intervention combined with behaviour change sessions. Intervention duration ranged from 10 weeks to 12 months. Assessment time points ranged from six to eight weeks up to 23 months. Psychological interventions compared with usual care We report data here for the 'over six months and up to 12 months' time point. We found that psychological interventions probably improve adherence to inhaled therapies (primary outcome) in people with CF compared with usual care (mean difference (MD) 9.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 8.60 to 10.40; 1 study, 588 participants; moderateâ€certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between groups in our second primary outcome, treatmentâ€related adverse events: anxiety (MD 0.30, 95% CI â€0.40 to 1.00; 1 study, 535 participants), or depression (MD â€0.10, 95% CI â€0.80 to 0.60; 1 study, 534 participants), although this was lowâ€certainty evidence. For our secondary outcomes, there was no evidence of a difference between groups in terms of lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) % predicted MD 1.40, 95% CI â€0.20 to 3.00; 1 study, 556 participants; moderateâ€certainty evidence); number of pulmonary exacerbations (adjusted rate ratio 0.96, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.11; 1 study, 607 participants; moderateâ€certainty evidence); or respiratory symptoms (MD 0.70, 95% CI â€2.40 to 3.80; 1 study, 534 participants; lowâ€certainty evidence). However, psychological interventions may improve treatment burden (MD 3.90, 95% CI 1.20 to 6.60; 1 study, 539 participants; lowâ€certainty evidence). The overall certainty of the evidence ranged from low to moderate across these outcomes. Reasons for downgrading included indirectness (current evidence included adults only whereas our review question was broader and focused on people of any age) and lack of blinding of outcome assessors. Psychological interventions compared with an active comparator For this comparison the overall certainty of evidence was very low, based on one trial (n = 128) comparing an MI intervention to EPS for 12 months. We are uncertain whether an MI intervention, compared with EPS, improves adherence to inhaled therapies, lung function, or quality of life in people with CF, or whether there is an effect on pulmonary exacerbations. The included trial for this comparison did not report on treatmentâ€related adverse events (anxiety and depression). We downgraded all reported outcomes due to small participant numbers, indirectness (trials included only adults), and unclear risk of bias (e.g. selection and attrition bias). Authors' conclusions Due to the limited quantity of trials included in this review, as well as the clinical and methodological heterogeneity, it was not possible to identify an overall intervention effect using metaâ€analysis. Some moderateâ€certainty evidence suggests that psychological interventions (compared with usual care) probably improve adherence to inhaled therapies in people with CF, without increasing treatmentâ€related adverse events, anxiety and depression (lowâ€certainty evidence). In future review updates (with ongoing trial results included), we hope to be able to establish the most effective BCTs (or 'active ingredients') of interventions for improving adherence to inhaled therapies in people with CF. Wherever possible, investigators should make use of the most objective measures of adherence available (e.g. dataâ€logging nebulisers) to accurately determine intervention effects. Outcome reporting needs to be improved to enable combining or separation of measures as appropriate. Likewise, trial reporting needs to include details of intervention content (e.g. BCTs used); duration; intensity; and fidelity. Large trials with a longer followâ€up period (e.g. 12 months) are needed in children with CF. Additionally, more research is needed to determine how to support adherence in 'underâ€served' CF populations. Plain language summary Psychological interventions to help people with cystic fibrosis take their inhaled treatments Key messages Psychological interventions are designed to help people modify their thoughts, feelings and behaviours. We think that psychological interventions are probably better than usual care at helping people with CF to take their inhaled treatments, and may cause little or no harm (e.g. anxiety or depression) when measured six to 12 months after treatment. We are uncertain whether motivational interviewing (MI) was better or worse than education plus problemâ€solving (EPS) at helping people with CF to take their inhaled treatments. Background CF is a chronic, genetic condition, usually diagnosed at birth through newborn screening. People with CF experience recurrent chest infections due to the buildâ€up of thick, sticky mucus (or sputum) in their lungs and digestive systems. Inhaled treatments are usually prescribed to either thin sputum (making it easier to clear or cough up), or to treat and control bacteria in the lungs (to reduce infections). People living with any longâ€term health condition often struggle to take the number of treatments they are prescribed, and this is no different in CF. What did we want to find out? Can psychological interventions help people with CF to take their inhaled treatments, and are there any harmful or unwanted effects of these interventions (e.g. anxiety or depression)? Which techniques (e.g. goalâ€setting, problemâ€solving) work best at helping people with CF to take their inhaled treatments? What did we do? We searched for studies comparing different types of psychological interventions, or comparing the interventions with usual care, for helping people with CF of any age to take their inhaled treatments. We compared and summarised the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as the trial methods. What did we find? We included 10 trials with 1642 people with CF (approximately 54.3% female). Four trials included children and adolescents; five trials included adults; and one trial included both. Nine trials compared a psychological intervention with usual care, and one study compared two psychological interventions (MI versus EPS). People (or in one trial, CF centres) were randomly selected for one group or the other. People were followed up for between six to eight weeks and 23 months. Psychological interventions were wideâ€ranging. They included an intervention that combined digital technology (website or app) with support from trained healthcare professionals. Interventions used a range of techniques, with problemâ€solving and providing instructions on how to take treatments being the most commonly used. Main results Psychological interventions are probably better than usual care at helping people with CF to take their inhaled treatments, and may cause little or no harm (e.g. anxiety or depression) when measured six to 12 months after treatment. Psychological interventions may also improve perceived treatment burden (as measured using a quality of life (QoL) questionnaire). There was no evidence of a difference between groups in terms of lung function (a measure of how well someone's lungs are working), the number of chest infections, or perceived chest symptoms (again measured using a QoL questionnaire). We are uncertain whether MI was better or worse than EPS at helping people with CF to take their inhaled treatments, improving lung function or QoL, or reducing chest infections in people with CF. The included trial did not look at whether MI or EPS caused harm (e.g. anxiety or depression). What are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in the evidence for psychological interventions being better or worse than usual care ranges from low to moderate. The biggest included trial of psychological interventions (which had results from between six and 12 months after treatment started) focused on adults with CF (aged 16 years and over), whereas the question we wanted to answer was broader (i.e. we cannot be sure if the results would be the same in children). Large trials with a longer followâ€up period (e.g. 12 months) are needed in children with CF. It is possible that because people completing the outcome assessments knew which group they were in, this might affect the results for QoL, anxiety and depression. We are not confident in the evidence comparing MI with EPS. The only trial examining this included a small number of adults, so we cannot be sure if the results would be the same in children or in a larger group of people. We are unsure whether participants were put into the different treatment groups truly at random, so differences between the groups might be due to differences between people rather than the treatments. We are also unsure about people leaving the trial early and how this might affect the results. We also think that because the people completing the outcome assessments knew which group they were in, this might affect the QoL results. Current evidence on which techniques (e.g. goalâ€setting, problemâ€solving) work best at helping people with CF to take their inhaled treatments is limited. Future trials should provide more details on the techniques used in interventions. How up to date is this evidence?

CD012040.PUB3,"Aslam, AA; Sinha, IP; Southern, KW",Ataluren and similar compounds (specific therapies for premature termination codon class I mutations) for cystic fibrosis,2023,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common, lifeâ€shortening, genetic disorder in populations of Northern European descent caused by the mutation of a single gene that codes for the production of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. This protein coordinates the transport of salt (and bicarbonate) across cell surfaces, and the mutation most notably affects the airways. In the lungs of people with CF, the defective protein compromises mucociliary clearance and makes the airway prone to chronic infection and inflammation, damaging the structure of the airways and eventually leading to respiratory failure. In addition, abnormalities in the truncated CFTR protein lead to other systemic complications, including malnutrition, diabetes and subfertility. Five classes of mutation have been described, depending on the impact of the mutation on the processing of the CFTR protein in the cell. In class I mutations, premature termination codons prevent the production of any functional protein, resulting in severe CF. Therapies targeting class I mutations aim to enable the normal cellular mechanism to read through the mutation, potentially restoring the production of the CFTR protein. This could, in turn, normalise salt transport in the cells and decrease the chronic infection and inflammation that characterises lung disease in people with CF. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To evaluate the benefits and harms of ataluren and similar compounds on clinically important outcomes in people with CF with class I mutations (premature termination codons). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, which is compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. The last search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register was conducted on 7 March 2022. We searched clinical trial registries maintained by the European Medicines Agency, the US National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization. The last search of the clinical trials registries was conducted on 4 October 2022. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of parallel design comparing ataluren and similar compounds (specific therapies for class I mutations) with placebo in people with CF who have at least one class I mutation. Data collection and analysis For the included trials, the review authors independently extracted data, assessed the risk of bias and evaluated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE; trial authors were contacted for additional data. Main results Our searches identified 56 references to 20 trials; of these, 18 trials were excluded. Both the included parallel RCTs compared ataluren to placebo for 48 weeks in 517 participants (males and females; age range six to 53 years) with CF who had at least one nonsense mutation (a type of class I mutation). The certainty of evidence and risk of bias assessments for the trials were moderate overall. Random sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding of trial personnel were well documented; participant blinding was less clear. Some participant data were excluded from the analysis in one trial that also had a high risk of bias for selective outcome reporting. PTC Therapeutics Incorporated sponsored both trials with grant support from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the US Food and Drug Administration's Office of Orphan Products Development and the National Institutes of Health. The trials reported no difference between treatment groups in terms of quality of life, and no improvement in respiratory function measures. Ataluren was associated with a higher rate of episodes of renal impairment (risk ratio 12.81, 95% confidence interval 2.46 to 66.65; P = 0.002; I 2  = 0%; 2 trials, 517 participants). The trials reported no treatment effect for ataluren for the review's secondary outcomes of pulmonary exacerbation, computed tomography score, weight, body mass index and sweat chloride. No deaths were reported in the trials. The earlier trial performed a post hoc subgroup analysis of participants not receiving concomitant chronic inhaled tobramycin (n = 146). This analysis demonstrated favourable results for ataluren (n = 72) for the relative change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) per cent (%) predicted and pulmonary exacerbation rate. The later trial aimed to prospectively assess the efficacy of ataluren in participants not concomitantly receiving inhaled aminoglycosides, and found no difference between ataluren and placebo in FEV 1  % predicted and pulmonary exacerbation rate.  Authors' conclusions There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the effect of ataluren as a therapy for people with CF with class I mutations. One trial reported favourable results for ataluren in a post hoc subgroup analysis of participants not receiving chronic inhaled aminoglycosides, but these were not reproduced in the later trial, suggesting that the earlier results may have occurred by chance. Future trials should carefully assess for adverse events, notably renal impairment, and consider the possibility of drug interactions. Crossâ€over trials should be avoided, given the potential for the treatment to change the natural history of CF. Plain language summary Ataluren and similar compounds (specific therapies for premature termination codon class I mutations) for cystic fibrosis Review question Can ataluren (and similar compounds specifically targeting class I mutations in cystic fibrosis (CF)) improve the quality of life and lung function of people with CF without having adverse effects? Key messages What is CF? In people with CF, the gene encoding a protein called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is faulty. This especially affects the airways, causing the airway surface to dry out and making it difficult to clear thick mucus. This leads to progressive infection and damages the lungs, shortening life expectancy. How will ataluren treat CF? In people with certain CF genetic mutations where the genetic instructions for producing  the CFTR protein are interrupted (known as premature termination codon or class I mutations), ataluren (and similar medicines) may be able to skip over the break in the faulty gene sequence and allow the body to produce a corrected version of the CFTR protein. By correcting the protein, the airway surface should remain hydrated, allowing people with CF to better clear their mucus and so develop fewer lung infections. What did we want to find out? We wanted to know whether ataluren can improve the quality of life and lung function of people with CF, and whether it can do so without any side effects. We also wanted to measure the effects on lung infections (need for hospital visits or additional antibiotics), survival, nutritional status (weight, body mass index and height) and whether treatment was costâ€effective. What did we do? We searched for trials that directly compared drugs such as ataluren to placebo (treatment not containing an active drug) or to a different treatment for these specific genetic mutations in any people with CF. What did we find? We found two trials including 517 people (males and females between 6 and 53 years of age) comparing ataluren to a placebo. The trials lasted 48 weeks and everyone taking part in the trials had at least one gene with a class I mutation. Key results In people taking ataluren, there was no improvement in clinical outcomes such as quality of life, lung function, exacerbations (flare up of disease), sweat chloride (salt) levels or weight compared with people taking placebo. The trials found that kidney damage was more common in people taking ataluren.  The earlier trial analysed their results in a way not originally planned to see whether the effects of ataluren and placebo were different in people using inhaled tobramycin (an antibiotic) on a longâ€term basis compared with people not taking the inhaled antibiotic. In people taking ataluren but not using inhaled tobramycin, lung function declined at a slower rate and there were fewer exacerbations than in people in the placebo group also not using inhaled tobramycin. The later trial specifically recruited people not taking tobramycin to see whether this really was an effect of the antibiotic, but the investigators did not find any difference between the ataluren and placebo groups for changes in lung function or exacerbations. This suggests that the earlier results occurred by chance. There were no deaths and we did not find any differences between ataluren and placebo in side effects or nutritional status. Neither trial reported on hospitalisations, extra courses of antibiotics or costâ€effectiveness. We have not found enough highâ€quality evidence to determine the effect of ataluren for treating CF. We recommend that future trials are designed and reported clearly so that their results can be included in a systematic review. What are the limitations of the evidence? We are moderately confident in our findings, but there is some uncertainty due to how widely the results varied between participants. We are satisfied that everyone taking part had an equal chance of being in either group (ataluren or placebo) and that no one could work out which group the next person would be put into (so that healthier people did not receive the treatment and make the results seem better). We believe that the clinicians running the trials and those taking part in the trials did not know which treatment each person was receiving. We have some concerns about the emphasis the investigators of one trial placed on the results of a comparison they had not planned (the use of longâ€term inhaled tobramycin). Unfortunately, that trial did not report all its results clearly. Sometimes, the results were reported in a way that meant they could not be used in this review, and sometimes the information was not reported at all. This affected our confidence in the overall results. Trial funding sources Both trials were sponsored by PTC Therapeutics Incorporated, who make ataluren. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the US Food and Drug Administration's Office of Orphan Products Development and the US National Institutes of Health also supported the trials.

CD007639.PUB3,"Stanford, G; Morrison, L; Brown, C",Nebuliser systems for drug delivery in cystic fibrosis,2023,"Abstract - Background Nebuliser systems are used to deliver medications to the lungs, to control the symptoms and the progression of lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). There are many different nebulisedâ€medications prescribed for people with CF and there are many different types of nebuliser systems. Some of these nebulised medications are licenced for, and can be taken via only one type of nebuliser system; some are licensed for, and can be taken via more than one type of nebuliser system. This is an update to a previous systematic review. Objectives To assess the time efficiency, effectiveness, safety, cost and impact of use (e.g. burden of care, adherence, quality of life (QoL)) of different nebuliser systems, when used with different inhaled medications for people with CF. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books containing conference proceedings. We searched the reference lists of each study for additional publications and approached the manufacturers of both nebuliser systems and nebulised medications for published and unpublished data. We also searched online trial registries. Date of the most recent search: 9 August 2023. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasiâ€RCTs comparing nebuliser systems, including conventional nebulisers, vibrating mesh technology (VMT) systems, adaptive aerosol delivery (AAD) systems and ultrasonic nebuliser systems. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. They also independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. A third review author assessed studies where agreement could not be reached. They assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Main results The search identified 216 studies with 33 of these (2270 participants) included in the review. These studies compared the delivery of tobramycin, colistin, dornase alfa, hypertonic saline and other solutions through the different nebuliser systems in children and adults with CF. This review demonstrates variability in the delivery of medication depending on the nebuliser system used. The certainty of the evidence ranged from low to very low. Some conventional nebuliser systems providing higher flows, higher respirable fractions, and smaller particles decrease treatment time, increase deposition (the amount of drug reaching the lung), and may be preferred by people with CF, as compared to other conventional nebuliser systems providing lower flows, lower respirable fractions and larger particles. Newer nebuliser systems using AAD, or VMT (or both) reduce treatment time compared to conventional systems. Deposition (as a percentage of priming dose) with AAD is greater than with conventional systems. VMT systems may give greater deposition than conventional systems when measuring sputum levels. The available data indicate that these newer systems are safe when used with an appropriate priming dose, which may be different to the priming dose used for conventional systems. There is an indication that adherence is maintained or improved and that individuals prefer AAD or VMT systems, but also that some nebuliser systems using VMT may be subject to increased system failures. There is limited, unclear evidence on the impact of different nebuliser systems on lung function and a lack of data on the impact of different nebuliser systems on our outcomes of quality of life (QoL), adverse effects, respiratory exacerbations and related implications, adherence, satisfaction, cost and device reliability. Authors' conclusions Newer technologies e.g. AAD and VMT have advantages over conventional systems in terms of treatment time, deposition as a percentage of priming dose, preference and adherence. Data are lacking for all varieties of medications which are used in CF care, including different inhaled antibiotics or hypertonic saline, with all delivery (nebuliser system) possibilities. Longâ€term RCTs are needed to evaluate different nebuliser systems to determine patientâ€focused outcomes (such as QoL and burden of care), safe and effective dosing levels of a wide variety of medications, clinical outcomes (such as hospitalisations and need for antibiotics), and an economic evaluation of their use. There are insufficient data to establish whether one nebuliser system is better than another overall. Clinicians should be aware of the variability in the performance of different nebuliser systems, compatibility with specific nebulised medication, and they must work with their patients to choose the best nebuliser system for each individual. This is likely to be an ongoing process as the needs and circumstances of each individual change over time. Plain language summary Nebulisers for giving medication for cystic fibrosis Key messages 1. Newer technologies have advantages over conventional systems in terms of treatment time, the amount of drug reaching the lung, preference, and adherence. 2. Not all medications used in treating cystic fibrosis can be delivered by the same nebuliser, and data are lacking for some of the different nebuliser and drug combinations. 3. Longâ€term studies are needed to evaluate different nebuliser systems to determine patientâ€focused outcomes (such as quality of life, effective dosing levels, and hospitalisations). What is cystic fibrosis? People with cystic fibrosis have sticky mucus in their lungs which is difficult to get rid of and which can cause infection if it builds up. How are nebulisers used as part of cystic fibrosis treatment? Nebulisers are used to deliver medications to the lungs to control the symptoms and the progression of disease. They change a liquid medication into a mist, so it can be breathed in. Different types of nebuliser systems are used with different medications. 1. Conventional systems â€ a machine pushes out a constant mist of medication at high speed. 2. Adaptive aerosol delivery systems â€ like conventional systems, also monitor breathing and only deliver the medication while the person is breathing in. 3. Vibrating mesh technology systems move the liquid medication through a metal mesh to generate a mist with similarâ€sized droplets which is delivered constantly. 4. Adaptive aerosol delivery systems with vibrating mesh technology combination between the two systems. 5. Ultrasonic systems use a crystal to vibrate the liquid medication at a high frequency and turn it into a mist which is delivered constantly. What did we want to find out? How well do the different nebuliser systems deliver each inhaled medication (how much medication is delivered into the lungs, and what is the impact on lung function)? Are they safe or do they have any side effects? We also wanted to know how these nebuliser systems affect people with cystic fibrosis in terms of treatment burden, adherence to treatment regimen and their quality of life. What did we do? We assessed 33 studies (2270 adults and children)and compared different types of nebuliser systems for delivering: tobramycin; colistin; dornase alfa; hypertonic saline; and other nebulised medications. What did we find? Conventional systems which have faster air flows and smaller medication droplets decrease treatment time and deliver more medication into the lung than other conventional systems, which have slower air flows and larger medication droplets. Nebulisers use newer technologies, e.g. adaptive aerosol delivery system or vibrating mesh technology, deliver the medication faster and may deliver more of the medication into the lung. These newer systems appear safe when used with the correct amount of medication, which may be different to that used in a conventional system. Some studies suggest that people with cystic fibrosis may prefer these newer systems and may take more of their medication when using them. However, more research is needed into what dose of medication is needed for the different systems, which medications suit which technologies best and how these newer nebuliser technologies affect quality of life, burden of treatment, additional treatment needed (such as oral or intravenous antibiotics) and treatment costs. What are the limitations of the evidence? There were lots of different systems studied, and often we only had a few studies for each comparison. Also, the studies we found were quite small and results varied. We had concerns around at least some aspects of the design of every study which affected our confidence in the results.

CD014606.PUB2,"Wong, C-H; Smith, S; Kansra, S",Digital technology for early identification of exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis,2023,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lifeâ€limiting genetic condition affecting various organ systems including the gastrointestinal tract, endocrine system and especially the respiratory tract. Pulmonary exacerbations in CF result in increased symptoms, an acceleration in the rate of lung decline and an increased need for treatment. Early detection of infections or clinical worsening provides an opportunity for proactive treatment that may affect clinical outcomes. Objectives To evaluate whether digital technology can effectively predict pulmonary exacerbations to allow earlier intervention and improved health outcomes without increasing the burden of treatment in people with CF. Search methods We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews on 13 October 2022. We searched Embase and the clinical trial registries on 3 January 2023. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasiâ€RCTs in people with CF looking at whether digital technology can effectively predict pulmonary exacerbations to allow earlier intervention and improved health outcomes without increasing the burden of treatment.  Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. pulmonary exacerbations and 2. quality of life (QoL). Our secondary outcomes were 3. lung function, 4. hospitalisations, 5. intravenous (IV) antibiotics, 6. microbiology, 7. costâ€effectiveness and 8. adverse events. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. Main results We included three studies (415 participants) in people with CF aged 15 to 41 years over a 12â€month period. One was a multicentre RCT, whilst two were singleâ€centre RCTs.  The three studies were mostly similar in their risk of bias, having low or unclear risk of selection bias but a high risk of detection bias, due to the unblinded design of these studies. The studies used a variety of digital technologies to monitor symptoms such as a digital symptom diary either with or without home spirometry monitoring. As the trials only included adults and older children, we are not certain that the results would apply to younger children. One of our primary outcomes was to assess time to detection of pulmonary exacerbation and number of pulmonary exacerbations identified between the intervention and routine care groups. We were largely unable to pool results in a metaâ€analysis due to the variety of methodologies and ways of reporting data. Two studies noted a shorter time to detection of exacerbations in the intervention group and one of these also reported that the intervention group had a shorter time to first exacerbation (hazard ratio for time to first exacerbation 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09 to 1.93), whilst a further study reported a shorter time to detection of exacerbations in the intervention group requiring oral or IV antibiotics compared to the control group (median: 70 (interquartile range (IQR) 123) days with intervention versus 141 (IQR 140) days with control; P = 0.02). However, all three studies were concordant in finding no probable effect on spirometry in the intervention groups when compared with their routine care groups over a 12â€month period.  We found that there is probably no difference between groups with regard to QoL scores across most domains except for Weight and Body Image, which favoured the usual care group. There is also probably no difference in the number of days of additional IV antibiotics needed or newly detected pathogens. No studies reported serious adverse events directly linked to the intervention and one study reported their smartphone application was generally well received. Authors' conclusions Pulmonary exacerbations are universally accepted to be detrimental to progression of CFâ€related lung disease, therefore, it is intuitive that early detection and intervention would help to improve outcomes. Digital technology provides an opportunity to detect physiological and symptomatic changes to identify exacerbations early.  Our review found that digital technologies based on recording physiological change (spirometry) and symptoms probably allow earlier identification of exacerbations as a group. However, this may not reduce the number of exacerbations warranting IV antibiotics and there is probably no effect on lung function. This may be partly due to inconsistent definitions of pulmonary exacerbations and discrepancy in the management strategies for pulmonary exacerbations. Overall, the intervention may make little or no difference to QoL scores.  The adherence to and uptake of digital technologies, especially those which include physiological measurements, are not well sustained and the costs of these need to be balanced against the clinical efficacy. Plain language summary Digital technology for early identification of chest infections in people with cystic fibrosis Review question Can digital technology identify chest infections in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) earlier than with standard care and how does this affect clinical outcomes? What is cystic fibrosis? CF is a lifeâ€limiting condition affecting several body organs, especially the lungs. Chest infections can worsen the damage in the lungs of people with CF. Identifying chest infections early and treating them quickly is very important. Digital technology, such as smartphone applications (apps) and devices to measure breathing to track symptoms may allow us to identify chest infections earlier in people with CF and start treatment with antibiotics quicker.  What did we want to find out? We want to know if early identification of chest infections can help slow down how quickly the condition of the lungs worsens.  What did we do? We searched medical databases for wellâ€designed clinical trials in people with CF. People taking part in the studies had the same chance of being in either the treatment group (who used the digital technology) or the usual care group. What did we find? We found three studies with 415 people with CF aged 15 to 41 years. All the treatment groups used a technology to track their breathing problems, two studies also asked their treatment groups to do regular breathing tests with special devices. All studies followed people in their groups for one year. Key results The studies that asked people to do regular breathing tests with special devices and track breathing problems were able to identify chest infections earlier than people in the usual care groups. However, at the end of the study, their breathing tests were similar to the groups that did not use digital technology.  There were few differences between the groups when we looked at how they felt in their dayâ€toâ€day life (quality of life), the number of hospital visits or costs. People who took part in the studies did not have any serious issues or problems that arose because of the digital technology they were using, but people were generally not very good at providing data regularly, and did find it quite a burden. What are the limitations of the evidence? We can only be moderately sure of these results from the studies we found. In all the studies, the people who took part will have known whether they were in the digital intervention group or the standard care group. This may have affected how they behaved, and what they thought of their breathing problems. In two studies, the teams running the study would have also known which group the person belonged to. This might have affected their choice on whether to start antibiotics, and whether to give the antibiotics by drip into a vein in hospital, or if they could take them as tablets or liquid medicine at home. Two studies did not recruit enough people, so we are less certain about how trustworthy those results are.  Some types of digital technology can detect chest infections sooner. However, when compared to relying on usual care, technology does not seem to change the rate at which the lungs in people with CF worsen over time.

CD001401.PUB4,"Warnock, L; Gates, A",Airway clearance techniques compared to no airway clearance techniques for cystic fibrosis,2023,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited progressive lifeâ€limiting disease characterised by the buildâ€up of abnormally thick, sticky mucus affecting mostly the lungs, pancreas, and digestive system. Airway clearance techniques (ACTs), traditionally referred to as chest physiotherapy, are recommended as part of a complex treatment programme for people with CF. The aim of an ACTs is to enhance mucociliary clearance and remove viscous secretions from the airways within the lung to prevent distal airway obstruction. This reduces the infective burden and associated inflammatory effects on the airway epithelia.  There are a number of recognised ACTs, none of which have shown superiority in improving shortâ€term outcomes related to mucus transport. This systematic review, which has been updated regularly since it was first published in 2000, considers the efficacy of ACTs compared to not performing any ACT in adults and children with CF. It is important to continue to review this evidence, particularly the longâ€term outcomes, given the recent introduction of highly effective modulator therapies and the improved health outcomes and potential changes to CF management associated with these drugs. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and acceptability of airway clearance techniques compared to no airway clearance techniques or cough alone in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings, to 17 October 2022. We searched ongoing trials registers (Clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) to 7 November 2022. Selection criteria We included randomised or quasiâ€randomised studies that compared airway clearance techniques (chest physiotherapy) with no airway clearance techniques or spontaneous cough alone in people with CF. Data collection and analysis Both review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We used GRADE methodology to assess the certainty of the evidence. Main results We included 11 crossâ€over studies (153 participants) and one parallel study (41 participants). There were differences between studies in how the interventions were delivered, with several intervention groups combining more than one ACT. One study used autogenic drainage; five used conventional chest physiotherapy; nine used positive expiratory pressure (PEP), with one study varying the water pressure between arms; three studies used oscillating PEP; two used exercise; and two used highâ€frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO). Of the 12 included studies, 10 were singleâ€treatment studies, and two delivered the intervention over two consecutive days (once daily in one study, twice daily in the second). This substantial heterogeneity in the treatment interventions precluded pooling of data for metaâ€analysis. Blinding of participants, caregivers, and clinicians is impossible in airway clearance studies; we therefore judged all studies at unclear risk of performance bias. Lack of information in eight studies made assessment of risk of bias unclear for most other domains.  We rated the certainty of evidence as low or very low due to the shortâ€term crossâ€over trial design, small numbers of participants, and uncertain risk of bias across most or all domains. Six studies (84 participants) reported no effect on pulmonary function variables following intervention; but one study (14 participants) reported an improvement in pulmonary function following the intervention in some of the treatment groups. Two studies reported lung clearance index: one (41 participants) found a variable response to treatment with HFCWO, whilst another (15 participants) found no effect on lung clearance index with PEP therapy (lowâ€certainty evidence). Five studies (55 participants) reported that ACTs, including coughing, increased radioactive tracer clearance compared to control, while a further study (eight participants) reported no improvement in radioactive tracer clearance when comparing PEP to control, although coughing was discouraged during the PEP intervention. We rated the certainty of evidence on the effect of ACTs on radioactive tracer clearance as very low. Four studies (46 participants) investigated the weight of mucus cleared from the lungs and reported greater secretions during chest physiotherapy compared to a control. One study (18 participants) reported no differences in sputum weight (very lowâ€certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions The evidence from this review shows that ACTs may have shortâ€term effects on increasing mucus transport in people with CF. All included studies had shortâ€term followâ€up; consequently, we were unable to draw any conclusions on the longâ€term effects of ACTs compared to no ACTs in people with CF. The evidence in this review represents the use of airway clearance techniques in a CF population before widespread use of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and acceptability of airway clearance in those treated with highly effective CFTR modulators. Plain language summary Airway clearance techniques compared to no airway clearance techniques for cystic fibrosis Review question What are the effects of using any airway clearance technique compared to not using an airway clearance technique for clearing excess mucus from the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis? Background The lungs of people with cystic fibrosis produce excess mucus. This leads to repeated infection and tissue damage in the lungs. It is important to clear the mucus using medicines and airway clearance techniques (physiotherapy). There are different airway clearance techniques for clearing mucus, some of which may include the use of mechanical devices. Daily physiotherapy takes a lot of time and trouble, so it is important to know if it works. We searched for studies where the people taking part had equal chances of being in the group using airway clearance techniques or the group with no airway clearance techniques. This is an update of a previously published review. Search date The evidence is current to 17 October 2022. Study characteristics We included 12 studies that enrolled 194 people with cystic fibrosis. The studies were very different and some looked at multiple treatments compared to no treatment. One study used autogenic drainage (a controlled breathing technique which uses different speeds and depths of exhaled breath to move mucus up the airways so it can be cleared by coughing); five studies used conventional chest physiotherapy (manual techniques of percussion and vibration applied to the chest wall, usually with the assistance of a physiotherapist or relative); nine used positive expiratory pressure (breathing out through a mask or mouthpiece against a resistance which causes pressure to build up in the lungs to move the mucus), and one of these varied pressure so used both standard and highâ€pressure positive expiratory pressure; three studies used oscillating positive expiratory pressure (positive expiratory pressure combined with vibrations within the airway to loosen mucus); two used exercise (on a treadmill); and two used highâ€frequency chest wall oscillation (high frequency vibrations applied outside the chest wall via an inflatable garment). We could not combine any results to analyse them statistically. Key results Summarising the findings of the 12 studies, we found limited evidence of a shortâ€term impact on lung function. Only one study reported an improvement in lung function in some of the treatment groups, whilst six other studies found no improvement.  This review found that methods of clearing the airways may have shortâ€term benefits for moving mucus. Four studies found that the people using airway clearance techniques coughed up more sputum, but one study reported no difference with or without using an airway clearance technique. Five studies reported increased radioactive tracer clearance (a test in which people are imaged continuously after inhaling a radioaerosol to assess the time for it to be cleared from the lung) when using airway clearance, but one study of positive expiratory pressure found no difference. At present, there is no clear evidence to show the longâ€term effects of performing airway clearance techniques on quality of life or survival. Limitations of the evidence We have little or very little confidence in the evidence, for several reasons. Most included studies had design problems, and in just under half of the studies, it was unclear whether all the results were reported. Also, in physiotherapy studies, the person receiving treatment and their physiotherapist know which treatment they are receiving, and this may affect some of the findings. For example, the amount of mucus coughed up and lung function tests (measured by half of the included studies) and a person's views on a particular technique (recorded in a quarter of the included studies) may be affected if a person is aware of which treatment they are receiving. Finally, it was not clear in most studies whether the individual was experienced with the technique they were using. We were unable to find any studies looking at the effects of airway clearance techniques in people treated with the new cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator treatments. Cystic fibrosis is caused by faulty proteins on the cell surface made by the mutated CFTR gene; these new medicines are designed to correct the function of the faulty proteins.

Established chronic  P aeruginosa  infection is virtually impossible to eradicate and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Early infection may be easier to eradicate. This is an updated review. Objectives Does giving antibiotics for  P aeruginosa  infection in people with CF at the time of new isolation improve clinical outcomes (e.g. mortality, quality of life and morbidity), eradicate  P aeruginosa  infection, and delay the onset of chronic infection, but without adverse effects, compared to usual treatment or an alternative antibiotic regimen? We also assessed costâ€effectiveness. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and conference proceedings. Latest search: 24 March 2022. We searched ongoing trials registries. Latest search: 6 April 2022. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of people with CF, in whom  P aeruginosa  had recently been isolated from respiratory secretions. We compared combinations of inhaled, oral or intravenous (IV) antibiotics with placebo, usual treatment or other antibiotic combinations. We excluded nonâ€randomised trials and crossâ€over trials. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Main results We included 11 trials (1449 participants) lasting between 28 days and 27 months; some had few participants and most had relatively short followâ€up periods. Antibiotics in this review are: oral â€“ ciprofloxacin and azithromycin; inhaled â€“ tobramycin nebuliser solution for inhalation (TNS), aztreonam lysine (AZLI) and colistin; IV â€“ ceftazidime and tobramycin. There was generally a low risk of bias from missing data. In most trials it was difficult to blind participants and clinicians to treatment. Two trials were supported by the manufacturers of the antibiotic used. TNS versus placebo TNS may improve eradication; fewer participants were still positive for  P aeruginosa  at one month (odds ratio (OR) 0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.18; 3 trials, 89 participants; lowâ€certainty evidence) and two months (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.65; 2 trials, 38 participants). We are uncertain whether the odds of a positive culture decrease at 12 months (OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.67; 1 trial, 12 participants). TNS (28 days) versus TNS (56 days) One trial (88 participants) comparing 28 days to 56 days TNS treatment found duration of treatment may make little or no difference in time to next isolation (hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.76; lowâ€certainty evidence). Cycled TNS versus cultureâ€based TNS One trial (304 children, one to 12 years old) compared cycled TNS to cultureâ€based therapy and also ciprofloxacin to placebo. We found moderateâ€certainty evidence of an effect favouring cycled TNS therapy (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.82), although the trial publication reported ageâ€adjusted OR and no difference between groups. Ciprofloxacin versus placebo added to cycled and cultureâ€based TNS therapy One trial (296 participants) examined the effect of adding ciprofloxacin versus placebo to cycled and cultureâ€based TNS therapy. There is probably no difference between ciprofloxacin and placebo in eradicating  P aeruginosa  (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.44; moderateâ€certainty evidence). Ciprofloxacin and colistin versus TNS We are uncertain whether there is any difference between groups in eradication of  P aeruginosa  at up to six months (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.23; 1 trial, 58 participants) or up to 24 months (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.42; 1 trial, 47 participants); there was a low rate of shortâ€term eradication in both groups. Ciprofloxacin plus colistin versus ciprofloxacin plus TNS One trial (223 participants) found there may be no difference in positive respiratory cultures at 16 months between ciprofloxacin with colistin versus TNS with ciprofloxacin (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.29; lowâ€certainty evidence). TNS plus azithromycin compared to TNS plus oral placebo Adding azithromycin may make no difference to the number of participants eradicating  P aeruginosa  after a threeâ€month treatment phase (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.35; 1 trial, 91 participants; lowâ€certainty evidence); there was also no evidence of any difference in the time to recurrence. Ciprofloxacin and colistin versus no treatment A single trial only reported one of our planned outcomes; there were no adverse effects in either group. AZLI for 14 days plus placebo for 14 days compared to AZLI for 28 days We are uncertain whether giving 14 or 28 days of AZLI makes any difference to the proportion of participants having a negative respiratory culture at 28 days (mean difference (MD) â€7.50, 95% CI â€24.80 to 9.80; 1 trial, 139 participants; very lowâ€certainty evidence). Ceftazidime with IV tobramycin compared with ciprofloxacin (both regimens in conjunction with three months colistin) IV ceftazidime with tobramycin compared with ciprofloxacin may make little or no difference to eradication of  P aeruginosa  at three months, sustained to 15 months, provided that inhaled antibiotics are also used (RR 0.84, 95 % CI 0.65 to 1.09; P = 0.18; 1 trial, 255 participants; highâ€certainty evidence). The results do not support using IV antibiotics over oral therapy to eradicate  P aeruginosa , based on both eradication rate and financial cost. Authors' conclusions We found that nebulised antibiotics, alone or with oral antibiotics, were better than no treatment for early infection with  P aeruginosa . Eradication may be sustained in the short term. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether these antibiotic strategies decrease mortality or morbidity, improve quality of life, or are associated with adverse effects compared to placebo or standard treatment. Four trials comparing two active treatments have failed to show differences in rates of eradication of  P aeruginosa . One large trial showed that intravenous ceftazidime with tobramycin is not superior to oral ciprofloxacin when inhaled antibiotics are also used. There is still insufficient evidence to state which antibiotic strategy should be used for the eradication of early  P aeruginosa  infection in CF, but there is now evidence that intravenous therapy is not superior to oral antibiotics. Plain language summary Different ways of giving antibiotics to clear  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  infection in people with cystic fibrosis Key messages â€ Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited condition where the airways often become blocked with mucus, and people with CF are more likely to get chest infections which cause more damage to the lungs. â€ Pseudomonas aeruginosa  ( P aeruginosa ) is often the cause of infection and is difficult to get rid of; antibiotics are the main treatment, but there are many different antibiotics, and they can be given in different ways. â€ Inhaled antibiotics may be better than no treatment allowing most people to remain free of  P aeruginosa  after one month. â€ There seems to be little difference in the other treatments we compared regarding how well they clear  P aeruginosa  from the lungs. What is cystic fibrosis? CF is the most common inherited condition that is lifeâ€limiting. Sticky mucus builds up in the lungs of people with CF, which makes it difficult to breathe and can lead to chest infections. These chest infections can cause further lung damage and lead to breathing failure and death. A germ called  P aeruginosa  is often the cause of infection and is difficult to treat successfully, once it has persisted for longer than six months. What did we want to find out? We wanted to compare different combinations of inhaled, oral and intravenous (IV) antibiotics for clearing  P aeruginosa  in people with CF, to see if any single treatment works best and is more costâ€effective. What did we find? The review includes 11 studies with a total of 1449 people with CF, of any age or sex, who had mild to severe lung disease. The studies lasted from 28 days to 27 months. We could not combine many results as studies used different treatments. There were 10 different comparisons of antibiotic treatments: three studies compared inhaled antibiotics with a placebo (dummy treatment); two studies compared inhaled antibiotics for different lengths of time; two studies compared inhaled tobramycin with or without oral antibiotics depending on how the infection was detected; two studies compared inhaled antibiotics plus an oral antibiotic with inhaled antibiotics plus a placebo; one study compared two different inhaled antibiotics plus an oral antibiotic; and one study compared IV antibiotics with oral antibiotics. Most of the studies showed how well the treatments got rid of  P aeruginosa  as well as how they affected lung function, other germs, worsening of flareâ€ups, and side effects. Main results Three small studies (of 89 people) treating early infection showed that after one month, inhaled antibiotics were better than no treatment and cleared  P aeruginosa  in most people, but our confidence in the evidence is low. There is likely to be little difference in the other treatments regarding how well they clear  P aeruginosa  from the lungs, although we found that inhaled antibiotics, alone or with oral antibiotics, were better than no treatment for early infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A study of IV ceftazidime with tobramycin in comparison with oral ciprofloxacin also showed neither group was better at getting rid of  P aeruginosa,  but we are more certain of the results and this means that it may be just as effective to treat with oral antibiotics. What are the limitations of the evidence? Some studies were carried out up to 30 years ago and the results may not apply today, and some studies were small. Most studies were quite short, so we could not show whether treatment made people with CF feel better or live longer. Given the treatments used in most of the studies, it would have been easy for people to guess which treatment they were receiving, which might have influenced some of the results. Two studies were supported by the pharmaceutical industry. Further research is needed to see whether clearing the infection completely improves the wellâ€being and quality of life in people with CF and to establish which antibiotic combination is best at clearing  P aeruginosa . Overall our confidence in the evidence was moderate to very low, so further research is likely to change our confidence in the results. However, we have higher confidence in one recently published study, which means we can be more sure of the results. How up to date is this evidence? The studies we have reported on are the most upâ€toâ€date we could find.

CD002011.PUB3,"Main, E; Rand, S",Conventional chest physiotherapy compared to other airway clearance techniques for cystic fibrosis,2023,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited lifeâ€limiting disorder. Over time persistent infection and inflammation within the lungs contribute to severe airway damage and loss of respiratory function. Chest physiotherapy, or airway clearance techniques (ACTs), are integral in removing airway secretions and initiated shortly after CF diagnosis. Conventional chest physiotherapy (CCPT) generally requires assistance, while alternative ACTs can be selfâ€administered, facilitating independence and flexibility. This is an updated review. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness (in terms of respiratory function, respiratory exacerbations, exercise capacity) and acceptability (in terms of individual preference, adherence, quality of life) of CCPT for people with CF compared to alternative ACTs. Search methods We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search was 26 June 2022. Selection criteria We included randomised or quasiâ€randomised controlled trials (including crossâ€over design) lasting at least seven days and comparing CCPT with alternative ACTs in people with CF. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. pulmonary function tests and 2. number of respiratory exacerbations per year. Our secondary outcomes were 3. quality of life, 4. adherence to therapy, 5. costâ€“benefit analysis, 6. objective change in exercise capacity, 7. additional lung function tests, 8. ventilation scanning, 9. blood oxygen levels, 10. nutritional status, 11. mortality, 12. mucus transport rate and 13. mucus wet or dry weight. We reported outcomes as shortâ€term (seven to 20 days), mediumâ€term (more than 20 days to up to one year) and longâ€term (over one year). Main results We included 21 studies (778 participants) comprising seven shortâ€term, eight mediumâ€term and six longâ€term studies. Studies were conducted in the USA (10), Canada (five), Australia (two), the UK (two), Denmark (one) and Italy (one) with a median of 23 participants per study (range 13 to 166). Participant ages ranged from newborns to 45 years; most studies only recruited children and young people. Sixteen studies reported the sex of participants (375 males; 296 females). Most studies compared modifications of CCPT with a single comparator, but two studies compared three interventions and another compared four interventions. The interventions varied in the duration of treatments, times per day and periods of comparison making metaâ€analysis challenging. All evidence was very low certainty. Nineteen studies reported the primary outcomes forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 )and forced vital capacity (FVC), and found no difference in change from baseline in FEV 1  % predicted or rate of decline between groups for either measure. Most studies suggested equivalence between CCPT and alternative ACTs, including positive expiratory pressure (PEP), extrapulmonary mechanical percussion, active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT), oscillating PEP devices (Oâ€PEP), autogenic drainage (AD) and exercise. Where single studies suggested superiority of one ACT, these findings were not corroborated in similar studies; pooled data generally concluded that effects of CCPT were comparable to those of alternative ACTs. CCPT versus PEP We are uncertain whether CCPT improves lung function or has an impact on the number of respiratory exacerbations per year compared with PEP (both very lowâ€certainty evidence). There were no analysable data for our secondary outcomes, but many studies provided favourable narrative reports on the independence achieved with PEP mask therapy. CCPT versus extrapulmonary mechanical percussion We are uncertain whether CCPT improves lung function compared with extrapulmonary mechanical percussions (very lowâ€certainty evidence). The annual rate of decline in average forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of FVC (FEF 25â€“75 ) was greater with highâ€frequency chest compression compared to CCPT in mediumâ€ to longâ€term studies, but there was no difference in any other outcome. CCPT versus ACBT We are uncertain whether CCPT improves lung function compared to ACBT (very lowâ€certainty evidence). Annual decline in FEF 25â€“75  was worse in participants using the FET component of ACBT only (mean difference (MD) 6.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 11.45; 1 study, 63 participants; very lowâ€certainty evidence). One shortâ€term study reported that directed coughing was as effective as CCPT for all lung function outcomes, but with no analysable data. One study found no difference in hospital admissions and days in hospital for exacerbations. CCPT versus Oâ€PEP We are uncertain whether CCPT improves lung function compared to Oâ€PEP devices (Flutter device and intrapulmonary percussive ventilation); however, only one study provided analysable data (very lowâ€certainty evidence). No study reported data for number of exacerbations. There was no difference in results for number of days in hospital for an exacerbation, number of hospital admissions and number of days of intravenous antibiotics; this was also true for other secondary outcomes. CCPT versus AD We are uncertain whether CCPT improves lung function compared to AD (very lowâ€certainty evidence). No studies reported the number of exacerbations per year; however, one study reported more hospital admissions for exacerbations in the CCPT group (MD 0.24, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.42; 33 participants). One study provided a narrative report of a preference for AD. CCPT versus exercise We are uncertain whether CCPT improves lung function compared to exercise (very lowâ€certainty evidence). Analysis of original data from one study demonstrated a higher FEV 1  % predicted (MD 7.05, 95% CI 3.15 to 10.95; P = 0.0004), FVC (MD 7.83, 95% CI 2.48 to 13.18; P = 0.004) and FEF 25â€“75  (MD 7.05, 95% CI 3.15 to 10.95; P = 0.0004) in the CCPT group; however, the study reported no difference between groups (likely because the original analysis accounted for baseline differences). Authors' conclusions We are uncertain whether CCPT has a more positive impact on respiratory function, respiratory exacerbations, individual preference, adherence, quality of life, exercise capacity and other outcomes when compared to alternative ACTs as the certainty of the evidence is very low. There was no advantage in respiratory function of CCPT over alternative ACTs, but this may reflect insufficient evidence rather than real equivalence. Narrative reports indicated that participants prefer selfâ€administered ACTs. This review is limited by a paucity of wellâ€designed, adequately powered, longâ€term studies. This review cannot yet recommend any single ACT above others; physiotherapists and people with CF may wish to try different ACTs until they find an ACT that suits them best. Plain language summary Conventional (traditional) chest physiotherapy compared to other methods of airway clearance in people with cystic fibrosis Review question Is conventional chest physiotherapy (CCPT) better than other methods of airway clearance for people with cystic fibrosis (CF)? Key messages Airway clearance techniques (ACTs) are a very important part of therapy in people with CF. There are now lots of different types of ACTs, but there is still very little known about how good each one is and how they compare to each other. The focus of this review was to compare CCPT (also known as traditional chest physiotherapy) with alternative ACTs. What is cystic fibrosis? CF is a lifeâ€limiting inherited disease affecting between 70,000 and 100,000 people worldwide. People with CF produce mucus in their lungs that can be thick, sticky and difficult to clear. This leads to repeated infections and lung damage. It is important to clear this mucus using medicines and various chest physiotherapy ACTs. CCPTs such as postural drainage, percussion and vibration, huffing and coughing have generally required assistance from someone else during treatments. Alternative ACTs such as active cycle of breathing techniques, forced expiration technique, autogenic drainage, positive expiratory pressure devices, oscillating positive expiratory pressure devices (e.g. Acapella, Aerobika, Flutter, RCâ€Cornet) or highâ€frequency chest compression and exercise are selfâ€administered, which increases independence and flexibility. What did we want to find out? We wanted to compare how different ACTs affect lung function (how well the lungs work), respiratory exacerbations (flareâ€ups of lung disease), a person's preference, adherence (how well the person follows their doctor's advice), quality of life and impact on fitness levels. What did we do? We searched medical databases for wellâ€designed studies comparing CCPT with other ACTs in people with CF. Studies selected people for one treatment or the other in a random or partly random way. We chose studies lasting longer than one week to allow enough time for treatments to have an impact on the outcomes we were interested in. What did we find? We found 21 studies with 778 people with CF aged from newborn to 45 years and with all levels of disease severity. The number of people included in each study ranged from 13 to 166. There were more females than males included in all but two studies. Main results The studies did not show that any alternative ACTs were better than CCPT in terms of lung function, respiratory exacerbations, a person's preference, adherence, quality of life and impact on fitness level. Studies in which participants had flareâ€ups of chest infections showed that lung function improved considerably after treatment, irrespective of the type of ACT. Longerâ€term studies showed smaller improvements or a decline in lung function. In 10 studies, participants preferred the chest physiotherapy techniques they could administer themselves, but, since the studies measured preference in different ways, we could not combine the individual study results in an analysis. Side effects from different ACTs tended to be rare, mild and resolved quickly. We cannot recommend any single treatment over another at this time. What are the limitations of the evidence? The quality of evidence varied greatly between the studies. We are not sure that the present evidence is able to answer the questions we were asking. We did not find enough evidence to confirm or exclude any differences between CCPT and alternative ACTs in terms of our outcome measures. Furthermore, data from our included studies did not show that any of the alternative ACTs were better than CCPT in people with CF. This may be because the studies did not report enough data for us to analyse, rather than confirming that the ACTs all worked equally well. There were differences in how the studies were run and how the researchers collected data, so this also makes it difficult to compare results. These differences included the number of people in the studies, length of time the studies lasted, location of the studies (e.g. in hospital or at home), types of ACTs used and outcomes measured by the researchers to assess the impact of the different techniques. In future studies it would be better if these factors were more similar to make it easier to compare results. How up to date is this evidence?

CD002010.PUB5,"Jeffery, TC; Chang, AB; Conwell, LS",Bisphosphonates for osteoporosis in people with cystic fibrosis,2023,"Abstract - Background Osteoporosis is a disorder of bone mineralisation occurring in about one third of adults with cystic fibrosis. Bisphosphonates can increase bone mineral density and decrease the risk of new fractures in postâ€menopausal women and people receiving longâ€term oral corticosteroids. This is an updated version of a previous review. Objectives To assess the effects of bisphosphonates on the frequency of fractures, bone mineral density, quality of life, adverse events, trial withdrawals, and survival in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register of references (identified from electronic database searches and hand searches of journals and abstract books) on 5 May 2022. We performed additional searches of PubMed, clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP (International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) on 5 May 2022. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of at least six months duration studying bisphosphonates in people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Authors independently selected trials, extracted data and assessed risk of bias in included studies. Trial investigators were contacted to obtain missing data. We judged the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Main results We included nine trials with a total of 385 participants (272 adults and 113 children (aged five to 18 years)). Trial durations ranged from six months to two years. Only two of the studies were considered to have a low risk of bias for all the domains.  Bisphosphonates compared to control in people with cystic fibrosis who have not had a lung transplant Seven trials included only adult participants without lung transplants, one trial included both adults and children without lung transplantation (total of 238 adults and 113 children). We analysed adults (n = 238) and children (n = 113) separately. Adults Three trials assessed intravenous bisphosphonates (one assessed pamidronate and two assessed zoledronate) and five trials assessed oral bisphosphonates (one assessed risedronate and four assessed alendronate). Bisphosphonates were compared to either placebo or calcium (with or without additional vitamin D). Data showed no difference between treatment or control groups in new vertebral fractures at 12 months (odds ratio (OR) 0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 2.09; 5 trials, 142 participants; very lowâ€certainty evidence) and two trials (44 participants) reported no vertebral fractures at 24 months. There was no difference in nonâ€vertebral fractures at 12 months (OR 2.11, 95% CI 0.18 to 25.35; 4 trials, 95 participants; very lowâ€certainty evidence) and again two trials (44 participants) reported no nonâ€vertebral fractures at 24 months. There was no difference in total fractures between groups at 12 months (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.50; 5 trials, 142 participants) and no fractures were reported in two trials (44 participants) at 24 months. At 12 months, bisphosphonates may increase bone mineral density at the lumbar spine (mean difference (MD) 6.31, 95% CI 5.39 to 7.22; 6 trials, 171 participants; lowâ€certainty evidence) and at the hip or femur (MD 4.41, 95% 3.44 to 5.37; 5 trials, 155 participants; lowâ€certainty evidence). There was no clear difference in quality of life scores at 12 months (1 trial, 47 participants; lowâ€certainty evidence), but bisphosphonates probably led to more adverse events (bone pain) at 12 months (OR 8.49, 95% CI 3.20 to 22.56; 7 trials, 206 participants; moderateâ€certainty evidence). Children The single trial in 113 children compared oral alendronate to placebo. We graded all evidence as low certainty. At 12 months we found no difference between treatment and placebo in new vertebral fractures (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.03 to 3.13; 1 trial, 113 participants) and nonâ€vertebral fractures (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.04; 1 trial, 113 participants). There was also no difference in total fractures (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.61; 1 trial, 113 participants). Bisphosphonates may increase bone mineral density at the lumbar spine at 12 months (MD 14.50, 95% CI 12.91 to 16.09). There was no difference in bone or muscle pain (MD 3.00, 95% CI 0.12 to 75.22), fever (MD 3.00, 95% CI 0.12 to 75.22) or gastrointestinal adverse events (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.20 to 2.26). The trial did not measure bone mineral density at the hip/femur or report on quality of life.  Bisphosphonates compared to control in people with cystic fibrosis who have had a lung transplant One trial of 34 adults who had undergone lung transplantation compared intravenous pamidronate to no bisphosphonate treatment. It did not report at 12 months and we report the 24â€month data (not assessed by GRADE). There was no difference in the number of fractures, either vertebral or nonâ€vertebral. However, bone mineral density increased with treatment at the lumbar spine (MD 6.20, 95% CI 4.28 to 8.12) and femur (MD 7.90, 95% CI 5.78 to 10.02). No participants in either group reported either bone pain or fever. The trial did not measure quality of life. Authors' conclusions Oral and intravenous bisphosphonates may increase bone mineral density in people with cystic fibrosis, but there are insufficient data to determine whether treatment reduces fractures. Severe bone pain and fluâ€like symptoms may occur with intravenous bisphosphonates. Before any firm conclusions can be drawn, trials in larger populations, including children, and of longer duration are needed to determine effects on fracture rate and survival. Additional trials are needed to determine if bone pain is more common or severe (or both) with the more potent zoledronate and if corticosteroids can ameliorate or prevent these adverse events. Future trials should also assess gastrointestinal adverse effects associated with oral bisphosphonates. Plain language summary Bisphosphonates for osteoporosis in people with cystic fibrosis Review question What are the effects of bisphosphonates (drugs that prevent the loss of bone mass), either oral (taken by mouth) or intravenous (given directly into a vein), on osteoporosis in people with cystic fibrosis (CF)? Background Cystic fibrosis is a serious genetic disorder that affects many organs in the body (e.g. lungs and pancreas). Around 23.5% of people with CF experience reduced bone mineral density (BMD), commonly known as osteoporosis, which increases the likelihood of bone fractures. The shortâ€term and longâ€term effects of fractures (e.g .  ribs and in the spine) may make lung disease worse, and hospitalisation more frequent. Bisphosphonates are drugs that increase BMD by slowing down how fast bone is resorbed. They are used to treat osteoporosis caused by the menopause or the use of corticosteroid drugs. We wanted to know if bisphosphonates affect the frequency of bone fractures, BMD and quality of life, and if they have any side effects in people with CF. This is an update of a previous review. Search date The evidence is current to 5 May 2022. Study characteristics We included nine trials with 272 adults and 113 children (aged five to 18 years) lasting from six months to two years. Eight trials included 238 adults without lung transplants; three of these gave intravenous bisphosphonates (one gave pamidronate and two gave zoledronate) and five trials gave oral bisphosphonates (one gave risedronate and four gave alendronate). Trials compared bisphosphonates to either placebo (drug with no active treatment) or calcium (with or without additional vitamin D). One of these eight trials, comparing oral alendronate to placebo, also included 113 children and we analysed their results separately. The last trial of 34 adults who had undergone lung transplantation compared intravenous pamidronate to no bisphosphonate treatment. Key results Bisphosphonates consistently increased BMD in adults at the lumbar spine and hip regions. It also increased BMD in children at the lumbar spine. Treatment with bisphosphonates did not appear to reduce the rates of fractures (either in the spine or elsewhere) or deaths in adults or children. However, this may be related to the small numbers of participants involved and the short duration of the trials. Severe bone pain and fluâ€like symptoms were commonly linked to intravenous bisphosphonates, especially in people not using corticosteroids. More research is needed to assess the effect of preâ€treatment with corticosteroids. Additional trials are needed to determine if bone pain is more common or severe (or both) with the stronger drug zoledronate and if corticosteroids lessen or prevent these adverse events. Additional trials should also assess gastrointestinal adverse effects in the stomach and digestive tract which are linked to oral bisphosphonates. Trials with larger numbers of participants with longer followâ€up are needed to show how bisphosphonates affect fracture rate and survival. More trials including children with cystic fibrosis should be undertaken to better understand the effects, benefits and harms these drugs may have on them. Bisphosphonates compared to control in people with CF who have not had a lung transplant Adults Five trials (142 participants) reported no difference between treatment or control groups in new vertebral or nonâ€vertebral fractures at 12 months and two trials (44 participants) reported no fractures at 24 months. At 12 months, results from six trials (171 participants) showed bisphosphonates may increase BMD at the lumbar spine and five trials (155 participants) reported the same effect on BMD at the hip or femur. There was no clear difference in quality of life (QoL) scores at 12 months, but bisphosphonates probably led to more bone pain at 12 months as reported by seven trials (206 participants). Children At 12 months we found no difference between treatment and placebo in new vertebral or nonâ€vertebral fractures. Bisphosphonates may increase BMD at the lumbar spine at 12 months. There was no difference in bone or muscle pain, in fever or in gastrointestinal side effects. The trial did not measure BMD at the hip/femur or report on QoL.  Bisphosphonates compared to control in people with CF who have had a lung transplant This trial only reported results at 24 months. There was no difference in the number of fractures, either vertebral or nonâ€vertebral, but BMD increased with treatment at the lumbar spine and femur. No one in either group reported either bone pain or fever. The trial did not measure QoL. Certainty of the evidence The certainty of the evidence was mixed and we had some concerns regarding different aspects of bias in all trials. At least three of the trials were partially funded by pharmaceutical companies. In one trial the people looking at the bone scans and reporting them may have known which participants had been treated with bisphosphonates; this knowledge may have affected their objectivity. Two trials did not report on fractures, but we do not think these are likely to have significantly changed the review's results.

CD010966.PUB4,"Heneghan, M; Southern, KW; Murphy, J; Sinha, IP; Nevitt, SJ",Corrector therapies (with or without potentiators) for people with cystic fibrosis with class II CFTR gene variants (most commonly F508del),2023,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common lifeâ€shortening genetic condition caused by a variant in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. A class II CFTR variant F508del is the commonest CFâ€causing variant (found in up to 90% of people with CF (pwCF)). The F508del variant lacks meaningful CFTR function â€ faulty protein is degraded before reaching the cell membrane, where it needs to be to effect transepithelial salt transport. Corrective therapy could benefit many pwCF. This review evaluates single correctors (monotherapy) and any combination of correctors (most commonly lumacaftor, tezacaftor, elexacaftor, VXâ€659, VXâ€440 or VXâ€152) and a potentiator (e.g. ivacaftor) (dual and triple therapies). Objectives To evaluate the effects of CFTR correctors (with or without potentiators) on clinically important benefits and harms in pwCF of any age with class II CFTR mutations (most commonly F508del). Search methods We searched the Cochrane CF Trials Register (28 November 2022), reference lists of relevant articles and online trials registries (3 December 2022). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (parallel design) comparing CFTR correctors to control in pwCF with class II mutations. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias and judged evidence certainty (GRADE); we contacted investigators for additional data. Main results We included 34 RCTs (4781 participants), lasting between 1 day and 48 weeks; an extension of two lumacaftorâ€ivacaftor studies provided additional 96â€week safety data (1029 participants). We assessed eight monotherapy RCTs (344 participants) (4PBA, CPX, lumacaftor, cavosonstat and FDL169), 16 dualâ€therapy RCTs (2627 participants) (lumacaftorâ€ivacaftor or tezacaftorâ€ivacaftor) and 11 tripleâ€therapy RCTs (1804 participants) (elexacaftorâ€tezacaftorâ€ivacaftor/deutivacaftor; VXâ€659â€tezacaftorâ€ivacaftor/deutivacaftor; VXâ€440â€tezacaftorâ€ivacaftor; VXâ€152â€tezacaftorâ€ivacaftor). Participants in 21 RCTs had the genotype F508del/F508del, in seven RCTs they had F508del/minimal function (MF), in one RCT F508del/gating genotypes, in one RCT either F508del/F508del genotypes or F508del/residual function genotypes, in one RCT either F508del/gating or F508del/residual function genotypes, and in three RCTs either F508del/F508del genotypes or F508del/MF genotypes. Risk of bias judgements varied across different comparisons. Results from 16 RCTs may not be applicable to all pwCF due to age limits (e.g. adults only) or nonâ€standard designs (converting from monotherapy to combination therapy). Monotherapy Investigators reported no deaths or clinically relevant improvements in quality of life (QoL). There was insufficient evidence to determine effects on lung function. No placeboâ€controlled monotherapy RCT demonstrated differences in mild, moderate or severe adverse effects (AEs); the clinical relevance of these events is difficult to assess due to their variety and few participants (all F508del/F508del). Dual therapy In a tezacaftorâ€ivacaftor group there was one death (deemed unrelated to the study drug). QoL scores (respiratory domain) favoured both lumacaftorâ€ivacaftor and tezacaftorâ€ivacaftor therapy compared to placebo at all time points (moderateâ€certainty evidence). At six months, relative change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) % predicted improved with all dual combination therapies compared to placebo (highâ€ to moderateâ€certainty evidence). More pwCF reported early transient breathlessness with lumacaftorâ€ivacaftor (odds ratio (OR) 2.05, 99% confidence interval (CI) 1.10 to 3.83; I 2  = 0%; 2 studies, 739 participants; highâ€certainty evidence). Over 120 weeks (initial study period and followâ€up), systolic blood pressure rose by 5.1 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 4.1 mmHg with twiceâ€daily 400 mg lumacaftorâ€ivacaftor (80 participants). The tezacaftorâ€ivacaftor RCTs did not report these adverse effects. Pulmonary exacerbation rates decreased in pwCF receiving additional therapies to ivacaftor compared to placebo (all moderateâ€certainty evidence): lumacaftor 600 mg (hazard ratio (HR) 0.70, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.87; I 2  = 0%; 2 studies, 739 participants); lumacaftor 400 mg (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.76; I 2  = 0%; 2 studies, 740 participants); and tezacaftor (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.89; 1 study, 506 participants). Triple therapy No study reported any deaths (highâ€certainty evidence). All other evidence was lowâ€ to moderateâ€certainty. QoL respiratory domain scores probably improved with triple therapy compared to control at six months (six studies). There was probably a greater relative and absolute change in FEV 1  % predicted with triple therapy (four studies each across all combinations). The absolute change in FEV 1  % predicted was probably greater for F508del/MF participants taking elexacaftorâ€tezacaftorâ€ivacaftor compared to placebo (mean difference 14.30, 95% CI 12.76 to 15.84; 1 study, 403 participants; moderateâ€certainty evidence), with similar results for other drug combinations and genotypes. There was little or no difference in adverse events between triple therapy and control (10 studies). No study reported time to next pulmonary exacerbation, but fewer F508del/F508del participants experienced a pulmonary exacerbation with elexacaftorâ€tezacaftorâ€ivacaftor at four weeks (OR 0.17, 99% CI 0.06 to 0.45; 1 study, 175 participants) and 24 weeks (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.60; 1 study, 405 participants); similar results were seen across other triple therapy and genotype combinations. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence of clinically important effects from corrector monotherapy in pwCF with F508del/F508del. Additional data in this review reduced the evidence for efficacy of dual therapy; these agents can no longer be considered as standard therapy. Their use may be appropriate in exceptional circumstances (e.g. if triple therapy is not tolerated or due to age). Both dual therapies (lumacaftorâ€ivacaftor, tezacaftorâ€ivacaftor) result in similar small improvements in QoL and respiratory function with lower pulmonary exacerbation rates. While the effect sizes for QoL and FEV 1  still favour treatment, they have reduced compared to our previous findings. Lumacaftorâ€ivacaftor was associated with an increase in early transient shortness of breath and longerâ€term increases in blood pressure (not observed for tezacaftorâ€ivacaftor). Tezacaftorâ€ivacaftor has a better safety profile, although data are lacking in children under 12 years. In this population, lumacaftorâ€ivacaftor had an important impact on respiratory function with no apparent immediate safety concerns, but this should be balanced against the blood pressure increase and shortness of breath seen in longerâ€term adult data when considering lumacaftorâ€ivacaftor. Data from triple therapy trials demonstrate improvements in several key outcomes, including FEV 1  and QoL. There is probably little or no difference in adverse events for triple therapy (elexacaftorâ€tezacaftorâ€ivacaftor/deutivacaftor; VXâ€659â€tezacaftorâ€ivacaftor/deutivacaftor; VXâ€440â€tezacaftorâ€ivacaftor; VXâ€152â€tezacaftorâ€ivacaftor) in pwCF with one or two F508del variants aged 12 years or older (moderateâ€certainty evidence). Further RCTs are required in children under 12 years and those with more severe lung disease. Plain language summary CFTR correctors, a therapy for cystic fibrosis targeted at specific variants (most commonly F508del) Review question How do drugs (or drug combinations) for correcting the basic defect in the most common cystic fibrosis (CF)â€causing gene variant (F508del) impact on outcomes important to people with CF (pwCF), e.g. survival, quality of life (QoL), lung function and safety? Key messages There is a lack of evidence to support monotherapy and limited evidence to support dual therapy for pwCF who have the gene variant F508del. We found important differences across key outcomes, with fewer unwanted side effects in the triple therapy studies when compared to one dual therapy drug combination (lumacaftor plus ivacaftor). More research is needed to assess triple therapy combinations in children and to monitor their safety profiles over the longer term. How would drugs (or drug combinations) correct the basic defect in the most common CFâ€causing gene variant (F508del)? The CF gene makes a protein that helps salts move across cells in many parts of the body. Over 80% of pwCF have at least one copy of the genetic variant F508del, meaning they make a full length of this protein, but it cannot move through the cell correctly. Laboratory experiments suggest that if this protein reaches the cell wall, it may be able to function, restore salt movement and correct the chronic problems that pwCF experience. What did we want to find out? How do drugs (or drug combinations) used to treat people of any age who have the genetic variant F508del impact their lives? Are these drugs associated with any unwanted side effects? What did we do? We searched for and included studies that looked at drugs (and drug combinations) used to treat pwCF who had at least one copy of the most common CFâ€causing gene variant (F508del) compared to control medications. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We included 34 studies that involved 4781 pwCF and which lasted between 1 day and 48 weeks; all studies compared an active drug treatment to a placebo (drug containing no active treatment). We do not have enough information to decide if 14 studies should be included or not and eight studies have not yet been completed. Eight studies looked at treatment with a single drug (monotherapy). These studies did not report any deaths or clinically relevant improvements in quality of life (QoL) scores. There was not enough evidence to show an effect on lung function. All studies reported side effects; there were a wide range of side effects each reported by a small number of participants in the studies. There were 16 studies assessing a combination of two drugs (dual therapy), either tezacaftor plus ivacaftor or lumacaftor plus ivacaftor. One participant taking tezacaftor plus ivacaftor died, but this was not thought to be related to the treatment. Both dual therapies resulted in improvements in QoL and lung function; rates of pulmonary exacerbations (a flareâ€up of symptoms) were also lower. Neither dual therapy was linked to severe side effects, although people starting treatment with lumacaftor plus ivacaftor experienced shortness of breath for one to two weeks; this usually stopped without further treatment .  More concerningly, in longer studies some people taking lumacaftor plus ivacaftor experienced a rise in blood pressure. Two people (out of over 500) even stopped lumacaftor plus ivacaftor treatment because of high blood pressure. These side effects were not reported for tezacaftor plus ivacaftor. There were 11 studies assessing different combinations of three drugs (triple therapy). The combinations were based on tezacaftor with ivacaftor (or deutivacaftor, which is a similar but chemically altered version of ivacaftor) and investigators then added either elexacaftor, VXâ€659, VXâ€440 or VXâ€152 and compared these to either triple placebo, or tezacaftor with ivacaftor and one placebo. Some studies split groups by treatment and also by different genetic variants. No study reported any deaths. Triple therapies improved QoL scores and lung function in all comparisons, with no difference in the number or severity of side effects. Fewer people with two copies of F508del taking elexacaftor plus tezacaftor plus ivacaftor experienced a pulmonary exacerbation than those taking the control treatment. What are the limitations of the evidence? Our certainty in the evidence ranged from uncertain to very certain, but we were quite certain of the evidence for most results. While studies generally provided few details about their design, so we could not make clear judgements on potential biases, we had fewer concerns with the larger, more recent studies. Some of our findings are based on studies that were too small to show important effects and for 16 studies the results may not be applicable to all pwCF due to them only including people of certain ages (i.e. only adults or only children). Also, one study had an unusual design where people were given monotherapy and then later a dual therapy. How upâ€toâ€date is this evidence? This review updates our earlier review.

CD007862.PUB5,"Wilson, LM; Saldanha, IJ; Robinson, KA",Active cycle of breathing technique for cystic fibrosis,2023,"Abstract - Background People with cystic fibrosis (CF) experience chronic airway infections as a result of mucus buildup within the lungs. Repeated infections often cause lung damage and disease. Airway clearance therapies aim to improve mucus clearance, increase sputum production, and improve airway function. The active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) is an airway clearance method that uses a cycle of techniques to loosen airway secretions including breathing control, thoracic expansion exercises, and the forced expiration technique. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To compare the clinical effectiveness of ACBT with other airway clearance therapies in CF. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched clinical trials registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 29 March 2021. Selection criteria We included randomised or quasiâ€randomised controlled clinical studies, including crossâ€over studies, comparing ACBT with other airway clearance therapies in CF. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened each article, abstracted data and assessed the risk of bias of each study. We used GRADE to assess our confidence in the evidence assessing quality of life, participant preference, adverse events, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) % predicted, forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted, sputum weight, and number of pulmonary exacerbations. Main results Our search identified 99 studies, of which 22 (559 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Eight randomised controlled studies (259 participants) were included in the analysis; five were of crossâ€over design. The 14 remaining studies were crossâ€over studies with inadequate reports for complete assessment. The study size ranged from seven to 65 participants. The age of the participants ranged from six to 63 years (mean age 18.7 years). In 13 studies follow up lasted a single day. However, there were two longâ€term randomised controlled studies with follow up of one to three years. Most of the studies did not report on key quality items, and therefore, have an unclear risk of bias in terms of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and outcome assessor blinding. Due to the nature of the intervention, none of the studies blinded participants or the personnel applying the interventions. However, most of the studies reported on all planned outcomes, had adequate follow up, assessed compliance, and used an intentionâ€toâ€treat analysis. Included studies compared ACBT with autogenic drainage, airway oscillating devices (AOD), highâ€frequency chest compression devices, conventional chest physiotherapy (CCPT), positive expiratory pressure (PEP), and exercise. We found no difference in quality of life between ACBT and PEP mask therapy, AOD, other breathing techniques, or exercise (very lowâ€certainty evidence). There was no difference in individual preference between ACBT and other breathing techniques (very lowâ€certainty evidence). One study comparing ACBT with ACBT plus postural exercise reported no deaths and no adverse events (very lowâ€certainty evidence). We found no differences in lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) % predicted and forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted), oxygen saturation or expectorated sputum between ACBT and any other technique (very lowâ€certainty evidence). There were no differences in the number of pulmonary exacerbations between people using ACBT and people using CCPT (lowâ€certainty evidence) or ACBT with exercise (very lowâ€certainty evidence), the only comparisons to report this outcome. Authors' conclusions There is little evidence to support or reject the use of the ACBT over any other airway clearance therapy and ACBT is comparable with other therapies in outcomes such as participant preference, quality of life, exercise tolerance, lung function, sputum weight, oxygen saturation, and number of pulmonary exacerbations. Longerâ€term studies are needed to more adequately assess the effects of ACBT on outcomes important for people with cystic fibrosis such as quality of life and preference. Plain language summary A comparison of active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) with other methods of airway clearance therapies in people with cystic fibrosis Review question What are the effects of active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) compared with other methods of airway clearance in people with cystic fibrosis? Background Chronic infections are common in cystic fibrosis, and repeated infections can cause lung damage and disease. People with cystic fibrosis use airway clearance therapies to clear mucus and improve lung function. The ACBT uses a combination of three breathing methods to loosen and clear mucus. This is an update of a previously published review. Search date The evidence is current to: 29 March 2021. Study characteristics While we included 22 studies comparing ACBT with other airway clearance therapies in the review, only eight studies (259 participants) reported data that we could include in the analysis. Each of the eight studies compared different techniques: ACBT was compared with autogenic drainage, airway oscillating devices, highâ€frequency chest compression devices, positive expiratory pressure, conventional chest physiotherapy, and ACBT together with exercise. Most studies lasted a single day, but there were two studies that lasted between one and three years. Participants ranged in age from six to 63 years and most (59%) were male. Key results We found that ACBT was comparable with other treatments in outcomes such as quality of life, personal preference, exercise tolerance, lung function, sputum weight, oxygen saturation, and the number of pulmonary exacerbations. We were not able to show that any single technique was better than another. Longer studies are needed to better assess the effects of ACBT on outcomes important for people with cystic fibrosis such as quality of life and personal preference. Certainty of the evidence We have little or no confidence in the evidence and think that further research is very likely to affect our conclusions of this review for any of the interventions analysed. Many of the studies did not provide enough details of their methods to determine if there were any biases that might have affected the results. Many studies did not report how they decided who would get which treatment and how they made sure that the people who were putting people into the different treatment groups and those who were assessing the results did not know which group each individual was in. Most of the included studies had a crossâ€over design (where people have one treatment and then switch to the second), and many of these did not report the length of time in between different treatments. As it is possible that the first treatment might affect the results of the next treatment, we only included results from the first treatment period. Many of the studies did not report separate results for just the first treatment period, so we did not include their results in our review. All participants knew which treatment group they were in (it is not possible to disguise different physiotherapy techniques). This could have affected the results for some of the selfâ€reported outcomes, such as quality of life, personal preference, or exercise tolerance, but is unlikely to have affected the more objective outcomes, such as lung function. Most of the studies followed those taking part for less than one month and did this for most of the participants for the entire study period. In two out of the three longer studies more than 10% of the people taking part dropped out. The study results could be affected if the people who dropped out of the studies were not evenly spread across the different treatment groups. Over half of the studies checked that participants were using the airway clearance therapy they were supposed to. Most of the studies reported on all their planned outcomes. The findings of the review were limited as not many studies made the same comparisons; also, there were not many longâ€term studies and the studies we included did not report enough data.",2,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",1465-1858,*Chest Wall Oscillation; *Cystic Fibrosis [therapy]; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Humans; Middle Aged; Mucus; Quality of Life; Respiratory Therapy [methods]; Young Adult,10.1002/14651858.CD007862.pub5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007862.pub5,Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders,98.0
CD009530.PUB5,"Jain, K; Wainwright, CE; Smyth, AR",Bronchoscopyâ€guided antimicrobial therapy for cystic fibrosis,2024,"Abstract - Background Early diagnosis and treatment of lower respiratory tract infections is the mainstay of management of lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF). When sputum samples are unavailable, diagnosis relies mainly on cultures from oropharyngeal specimens; however, there are concerns about whether this approach is sensitive enough to identify lower respiratory organisms. Bronchoscopy and related procedures such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) are invasive but allow the collection of lower respiratory specimens from nonâ€sputum producers. Cultures of bronchoscopic specimens provide a higher yield of organisms compared to those from oropharyngeal specimens. Regular use of bronchoscopy and related procedures may increase the accuracy of diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections and improve the selection of antimicrobials, which may lead to clinical benefits. This is an update of a previous review that was first published in 2013 and was updated in 2016 and in 2018. Objectives To evaluate the use of bronchoscopyâ€guided (also known as bronchoscopyâ€directed) antimicrobial therapy in the management of lung infection in adults and children with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched three registries of ongoing studies and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. The date of the most recent searches was 1 November 2023. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled studies involving people of any age with CF that compared the outcomes of antimicrobial therapies guided by the results of bronchoscopy (and related procedures) versus those guided by any other type of sampling (e.g. cultures from sputum, throat swab and cough swab). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed their risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study investigators for further information when required. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE criteria. Main results We included two studies in this updated review. One study enrolled 170 infants under six months of age who had been diagnosed with CF through newborn screening. Participants were followed until they were five years old, and data were available for 157 children. The study compared outcomes for pulmonary exacerbations following treatment directed by BAL versus standard treatment based on clinical features and oropharyngeal cultures. The second study enrolled 30 children with CF aged between five and 18 years and randomised participants to receive treatment based on microbiological results of BAL triggered by an increase in lung clearance index (LCI) of at least one unit above baseline or to receive standard treatment based on microbiological results of oropharyngeal samples collected when participants were symptomatic. We judged both studies to have a low risk of bias across most domains, although the risk of bias for allocation concealment and selective reporting was unclear in the smaller study. In the larger study, the statistical power to detect a significant difference in the prevalence of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  was low because  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  isolation in BAL samples at five years of age in both groups were much lower than the expected rate that was used for the power calculation. We graded the certainty of evidence for the key outcomes as low, other than for highâ€resolution computed tomography scoring and costâ€ofâ€care analysis, which we graded as moderate certainty. Both studies reported similar outcomes, but metaâ€analysis was not possible due to different ways of measuring the outcomes and different indications for the use of BAL. Whether antimicrobial therapy is directed by the use of BAL or standard care may make little or no difference in lung function z scores after two years (n = 29) as measured by the change from baseline in LCI and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (lowâ€certainty evidence). At five years, the larger study found little or no difference between groups in absolute FEV1 z score or forced vital capacity (FVC) (lowâ€certainty evidence). BALâ€directed therapy probably makes little or no difference to any measure of chest scores assessed by computed tomography (CT) scan at either two or five years (different measures used in the two studies; moderateâ€certainty evidence). BALâ€directed therapy may make little or no difference in nutritional parameters or in the number of positive isolates of  P aeruginosa  per participant per year, but may lead to more hospitalisations per year (1 study, 157 participants; lowâ€certainty evidence). There is probably no difference in average cost of care per participant (either for hospitalisations or total costs) at five years between BALâ€directed therapy and standard care (1 study, 157 participants; moderateâ€certainty evidence). We found no difference in healthâ€related quality of life between BALâ€directed therapy and standard care at either two or five years, and the larger study found no difference in the number of isolates of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  per child per year. The eradication rate following one or two courses of eradication treatment and the number of pulmonary exacerbations were comparable in the two groups. Mild adverse events, when reported, were generally well tolerated. The most common adverse event reported was transient worsening of cough after 29% of procedures. Significant clinical deterioration was documented during or within 24 hours of BAL in 4.8% of procedures. Authors' conclusions This review, limited to two wellâ€designed randomised controlled studies, shows no evidence to support the routine use of BAL for the diagnosis and management of pulmonary infection in preschool children with CF compared to the standard practice of providing treatment based on results of oropharyngeal culture and clinical symptoms. No evidence is available for adults. Plain language summary Using samples obtained by bronchoscopy to decide how to treat lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis Key messages We found evidence from two small studies that only included children. We do not know the best way to get samples that guide which antibiotics should be prescribed for a lung infection. What is the background to the review? CF is a genetic condition that causes damage to the lungs, digestive system and other organs. Breathing problems in people with CF are mainly due to repeated lung infections. Growing bugs from samples of mucus coughed up from the lower airways can allow doctors to quickly identify the bug causing the infection and start treatment early. If people can not cough up mucus, swabs are taken from the upper throat to identify the bug causing infection in the lower airways, but this may not be the most reliable method. During a bronchoscopy, doctors examine the lower airways using a long, thin flexible tube with a light and camera at one end; they may also collect mucus. The patient needs to be sedated or put under general anaesthetic. We do not know if treatment based on samples taken during a bronchoscopy is better than treatment based on throat swabs. This review updates a review first published in 2013. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out whether to use samples obtained by bronchoscopy when deciding how to treat lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). What did we do? We searched for studies involving people of any age with CF. We summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We included two studies in this review, which involved 186 children. One study recruited 170 babies under the age of six months who were diagnosed with CF and monitored them for up to five years. The second study included 30 children with CF between the ages of five and 18 years and monitored them for up to two years. In both studies, the participants were divided into two groups completely at random, with one group given antibiotics based on samples taken via bronchoscopy and the other group given antibiotics based on samples taken from the throat. In the larger study, children had a bronchoscopy when they showed features of worsening chest symptoms, whereas children in the smaller study had a bronchoscopy when they showed an increase in the Lung Clearance Index, which is a marker of early lung disease that measures how well the air moves within the lungs. Main results Neither study showed any difference between the groups in terms of lung function, weight, body mass index or in the score calculated by a computed tomography (CT) scan of the lungs when measured at either two or five years. The longer study also showed that there was no difference in how many children in each group had an infection with  Pseudomonas   aeruginosa  at five years of age, or per year of followâ€up, or how often a child was unwell with respiratory symptoms. In this longer study, children in the bronchoscopy group were admitted to hospital more often, although admissions were generally shorter than in the comparison group. There was no difference between the groups in the overall cost of care and healthâ€related quality of life scores. Side effects reported during and after bronchoscopy were not serious; the most common side effect was increased coughing (in one third of children). There is currently not enough evidence to support the regular use of bronchoscopy to diagnose and treat lung infections in children with CF. What are the limitations of the evidence? Evidence was limited to two studies. While these studies were well designed, we could not combine their results because they used different methods of measurement. We have low confidence in the reliability of the evidence for most outcomes, and moderate confidence in the results for two outcomes (highâ€resolution computed tomography scoring and costâ€ofâ€care analysis). We cannot be sure about the results because of the small number of children included. Also, the studies only included young children, so we do not know if the results would be the same in adults with CF. Since the treatment of a first infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  is highly successful, larger and longer studies are needed to detect small differences between the groups. Conducting such large studies is extremely difficult and more sensitive measures should be used. How up to date is this evidence?

CD002203.PUB5,"Southern, KW; Solis-Moya, A; Kurz, D; Smith, S",Macrolide antibiotics (including azithromycin) for cystic fibrosis,2024,"Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lifeâ€limiting genetic condition, affecting over 90,000 people worldwide. CF affects several organs in the body, but airway damage has the most profound impact on quality of life (QoL) and survival. Causes of lower airway infection in people with CF are, most notably,  Staphylococcus aureus  in the early course of the disease and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  at a later stage. Macrolide antibiotics, e.g. azithromycin and clarithromycin, are usually taken orally, have a broad spectrum of action against gramâ€positive (e.g.  S aureus ) and some gramâ€negative bacteria (e.g.  Haemophilus influenzae ), and may have a modifying role in diseases involving airway infection and inflammation such as CF. They are wellâ€tolerated and relatively inexpensive, but widespread use has resulted in the emergence of resistant bacteria. This is an updated review. Objectives To assess the potential effects of macrolide antibiotics on clinical status in terms of benefit and harm in people with CF. If benefit was demonstrated, we aimed to assess the optimal type, dose and duration of macrolide therapy. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals, and abstract books of conference proceedings. We last searched the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register on 2 November 2022. We last searched the trial registries WHO ICTRP and clinicaltrials.gov on 9 November 2022. We contacted investigators known to work in the field, previous authors and pharmaceutical companies manufacturing macrolide antibiotics for unpublished or followâ€up data, where possible. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials of macrolide antibiotics in adults and children with CF. We compared them to: placebo; another class of antibiotic; another macrolide antibiotic; or the same macrolide antibiotic at a different dose or type of administration. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Main results We included 14 studies (1467 participants) lasting 28 days to 36 months. All the studies assessed azithromycin: 11 compared oral azithromycin to placebo (1167 participants); one compared a high dose to a low dose (47 participants); one compared nebulised to oral azithromycin (45 participants); and one looked at weekly versus daily dose (208 participants). Oral azithromycin versus placebo There is a slight improvement in forced expiratory volume (FEV 1  % predicted) in one second in the azithromycin group at up to six months compared to placebo (mean difference (MD) 3.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.74 to 6.19; highâ€certainty evidence), although there is probably no difference at three months, (MD 2.70%, 95% CI â€0.12 to 5.52), or 12 months (MD â€0.13, 95% CI â€4.96 to 4.70). Participants in the azithromycin group are probably at a decreased risk of pulmonary exacerbation with a longer time to exacerbation (hazard ratio (HR) 0.61, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.75; moderateâ€certainty evidence). Mild side effects were common, but there was no difference between groups (moderateâ€certainty evidence). There is no difference in hospital admissions at six months (odds ratio (OR) 0.61, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.04; highâ€certainty evidence), or in new acquisition of  P aeruginosa  at 12 months (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.55; moderateâ€certainty evidence). Highâ€dose versus lowâ€dose azithromycin We are uncertain whether there is any difference in FEV 1  % predicted at six months between the two groups (no data available) or in the rate of exacerbations per child per month (MD â€0.05 (95% CI â€0.20 to 0.10)); very lowâ€certainty evidence for both outcomes. Only children were included in the study and the study did not report on any of our other clinically important outcomes. Nebulised azithromycin versus oral azithromycin We were unable to include any of the data into our analyses and have reported findings directly from the paper; we graded all evidence as being of very low certainty. The authors reported that there was a greater mean change in FEV 1  % predicted at one month in the nebulised azithromycin group (P < 0.001). We are uncertain whether there was a change in  P aeruginosa  count. Weekly azithromycin versus daily azithromycin There is probably a lower mean change in FEV 1  % predicted at six months in the weekly group compared to the daily group (MD â€0.70, 95% CI â€0.95 to â€0.45) and probably also a longer period of time until first exacerbation in the weekly group (MD 17.30 days, 95% CI 4.32 days to 30.28 days). Gastrointestinal side effects are probably more common in the weekly group and there is likely no difference in admissions to hospital or QoL. We graded all evidence as moderate certainty. Authors' conclusions Azithromycin therapy is associated with a small but consistent improvement in respiratory function, a decreased risk of exacerbation and longer time to exacerbation at six months; but evidence for treatment efficacy beyond six months remains limited. Azithromycin appears to have a good safety profile (although a weekly dose was associated with more gastrointestinal side effects, which makes it less acceptable for longâ€term therapy), with a relatively minimal treatment burden for people with CF, and it is inexpensive. A wider concern may be the emergence of macrolide resistance reported in the most recent study which, combined with the lack of longâ€term data, means we do not feel that the current evidence is strong enough to support azithromycin therapy for all people with CF. Future research should report over longer time frames using validated tools and consistent reporting, to allow for easier synthesis of data. In particular, future trials should report important adverse events such as hearing impairment or liver disease. More data on the effects of azithromycin given in different ways and reporting on our primary outcomes would benefit decisionâ€making on whether and how to give macrolide antibiotics. Finally, it is important to assess azithromycin therapy for people with CF who are established on the relatively new cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapies which correct the underlying molecular defect associated with CF (none of the trials included in the review are relevant to this population). Plain language summary Treatment with macrolide antibiotics (including azithromycin) for people with cystic fibrosis Review question What are the effects of macrolide antibiotics in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) and infection of their airways? Key messages â€ People with CF are more prone to chest infections caused by bacteria that can be hard to treat. â€ Macrolide antibiotics (such as azithromycin and clarithromycin) may lessen the effects of bacteria. â€ One macrolide antibiotic, azithromycin, can improve lung function at six months compared to a placebo (treatment with no active ingredient) and may reduce the risk of getting a flareâ€up of lung infection. We are not sure whether a higher dose of azithromycin is any better than a lower dose, or if azithromycin when inhaled is any better than azithromycin when swallowed (oral). Oral azithromycin once a week compared to every day probably leads to less of an improvement in lung function, but there is probably a longer time to a flareâ€up in the weekly group. â€ Current evidence does not support longerâ€term use of azithromycin for all people with CF. Introduction People with CF suffer from infections in their airways, often caused by the bug  Pseudomonas aeruginosa , which is resistant to nearly all antibiotics that can be swallowed (oral). Macrolide antibiotics, e.g. azithromycin and clarithromycin, have no direct killing effect on  Pseudomonas aeruginosa , but they may reduce the activity of these bacteria. What did we want to find out? We wanted to discover whether the use of macrolide antibiotics (usually taken orally) affected the health of people with CF and whether these drugs have any side effects. What did we do? We searched for studiesthat looked at the effects of macrolide antibiotics in children and adults with CF and summarised the evidence. What did we find? We found 14 studies, which put the total of 1467 children and adults into different treatment groups at random, which we included in this review. Eleven studies compared azithromycin to placebo, one compared two different doses of azithromycin (high versus low dose), one compared inhaled azithromycin to oral azithromycin, and one compared oral azithromycin once a week to once a day. Main results We found that there was a slight improvement in lung function in people that were given azithromycin compared to a placebo at six months and also that the risk of a flareâ€up of infection was lower. The risk of side effects (such as vomiting, diarrhoea and headache) was similar in both groups, as was the chance of a new infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  In terms of lung function and flareâ€up of infection, we were unsure whether a higher dose of azithromycin is better than a lower dose (but only one study in children examined dose), or whether inhaled azithromycin is better than oral azithromycin. Taking oral azithromycin once a week compared to every day probably leads to less of an improvement in lung function, but there is probably a longer time to a flareâ€up in the weekly group. What are the limitations of the evidence? We were unable to combine all the study results because they were measured in different ways and at different time points; future trials should address this issue. Also, now that many people with CF are being treated with the new modulator therapies (e.g. elexacaftorâ€tezacaftorâ€ivacaftor), it is important to assess how macrolide antibiotics affect the health of these people. In the studies we found for this review, none of the people taking part were being treated with modulator therapies. We are able to report the results of the studies that compared azithromycin to placebo with certainty as the studies were well conducted and included a larger number of participants. The evidence from the studies comparing high and low doses or nebulised and oral azithromycin was much less certain because the studies were small and there was risk of bias in the way they were carried out. We were moderately certain of the results of the study comparing weekly azithromycin to daily azithromycin. How up to date is this evidence? The studies we have reported are the most up to date we could find.
