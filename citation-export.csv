"CD004731.PUB4","Yi, SHL; Singh, RH","Protein substitute for children and adults with phenylketonuria","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2015","Abstract - Background Phenylketonuria is an inherited metabolic disorder characterised by an absence or deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. The aim of treatment is to lower blood phenylalanine concentrations to the recommended therapeutic range to prevent developmental delay and support normal growth. Current treatment consists of a low‐phenylalanine diet in combination with a protein substitute which is free from or low in phenylalanine. Guidance regarding the use, dosage, and distribution of dosage of the protein substitute over a 24‐hour period is unclear, and there is variation in recommendations among treatment centres. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005, and previously updated in 2008. Objectives To assess the benefits and adverse effects of protein substitute, its dosage, and distribution of dose in children and adults with phenylketonuria who are adhering to a low‐phenylalanine diet. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which consists of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and hand searches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also contacted manufacturers of the phenylalanine‐free and low‐phenylalanine protein substitutes for any data from published and unpublished randomised controlled trials. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register: 03 April 2014. Selection criteria All randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing: any dose of protein substitute with no protein substitute; an alternative dosage; or the same dose, but given as frequent small doses throughout the day compared with the same total daily dose given as larger boluses less frequently. Data collection and analysis Both authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Main results Three trials (69 participants) are included in this review. One trial investigated the use of protein substitute in 16 participants, while a further two trials investigated the dosage of protein substitute in a total of 53 participants. Due to issues with data presentation in each trial, described in full in the review, formal statistical analyses of the data were impossible. Investigators will be contacted for further information. Authors' conclusions No conclusions could be drawn about the short‐ or long‐term use of protein substitute in phenylketonuria due to the lack of adequate or analysable trial data. Additional data and randomised controlled trials are needed to investigate the use of protein substitute in phenylketonuria. Until further evidence is available, current practice in the use of protein substitute should continue to be monitored with care. Plain language summary The impact of protein substitute on the nutrition status, growth, and neuropsychological performance of children and adults with phenylketonuria People with phenylketonuria (PKU) who follow a low‐phenylalanine diet are required to take protein substitute to ensure adequate consumption of protein, energy, and other nutrients. The need for protein substitute has been established through clinical experience and observational data. Randomised, controlled trials are needed to confirm this need as well as its proper dosage and frequency of use. We performed a systematic review of randomised control trials investigating the impact of the use, dosage, and distribution of protein substitute on physical and neuropsychological outcomes in the treatment of PKU. Trials of children and adults diagnosed with PKU in the newborn period who were treated early and continuously were included. We planned to pool the results of the trials to estimate treatment effect. Three trials met the inclusion criteria for the review. One trial evaluated the impact of protein substitute versus no protein substitute on neuropsychological status, plasma amino acid concentrations, and nutrient intake. The remaining two trials investigated the impact of differing dosages of protein substitute on plasma amino acid concentrations and nutrient intake. No trials investigating daily protein substitute distribution were eligible for inclusion in the review. Results are presented in text form only since adequate information for data pooling was not provided. The investigators will be contacted for further information. Currently data are insufficient to reach any conclusions regarding the use, dosage, and distribution of protein substitute in the treatment of PKU. Further randomized or controlled clinical trials are needed to provide evidence for the effectiveness, dosage, and distribution of protein substitute in the treatment of PKU.","2","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Food, Formulated; Adult; Child; Dietary Proteins [*administration & dosage]; Humans; Phenylalanine Hydroxylase [deficiency]; Phenylalanine [*blood]; Phenylketonurias [diet therapy, *therapy]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD004731.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004731.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD000407.PUB4","Cheng, K; Ashby, D; Smyth, RL","Oral steroids for long‐term use in cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2015","Abstract - Background In cystic fibrosis (CF) airway obstruction and recurrent respiratory infection lead to inflammation, long‐term lung damage, respiratory failure and death. Anti‐inflammatory agents, e.g. oral corticosteroids are used since inflammation occurs early in disease. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of oral corticosteroids in respiratory complications in CF, particularly lung function and adverse events. We examined long‐term use (over 30 days) only. Search methods We searched the Cochrane CF and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Most recent search: 28 August 2015. Selection criteria Randomised trials comparing oral corticosteroids given for more than 30 days with placebo or no additional therapy in people with CF. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and quality. Main results Of eleven studies identified, three (354 participants) were included: two with four‐year follow up and one with 12‐weeks follow up. Data were lacking on predefined outcomes; common outcomes were examined at different time‐points and presented differently. Meta‐analyses were not possible. In one study, oral corticosteroids at prednisolone‐equivalent dose of 1 mg/kg alternate days slowed progression of lung disease; at two and four years, % predicted FEV 1  in the 1 mg/kg group changed significantly more than in the placebo group (P < 0.02). During the first two years, the 2 mg/kg group was not significantly different from the placebo group. Linear growth retardation was observed from six months in the 2 mg/kg alternate days prednisolone group and from 24 months in the 1 mg/kg alternate days prednisolone group. Adverse events terminated one four‐year study early. Year 10 follow up showed catch‐up growth started two years after treatment ceased. Alternate‐day treatment with oral corticosteroids may have impaired growth until adulthood in boys. Authors' conclusions Oral corticosteroids at prednisolone‐equivalent dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg alternate days appear to slow progression of lung disease in CF; benefit should be weighed against occurrence of adverse events. Risk‐benefit analysis of low‐dose alternate days corticosteroids is important. No further trials of this intervention are anticipated, and hence the review will no longer be regularly updated. However, if any new data are published, these will be incorporate when available. Plain language summary Use of oral steroids for cystic fibrosis Cystic fibrosis causes frequent lung infection and the airways become blocked with mucus. This in turn leads to inflammation, which causes more lung damage and more mucus to be produced. Corticosteroids are strong drugs given to treat this inflammation. The review includes three trials; one for 12 weeks and two with four‐year follow up. We could not combine any data. Trials showed that oral steroids of 1mg/kg to 2 mg/kg (prednisolone equivalent) given every other day seemed to slow the advance of lung disease. However, there are serious adverse effects such as cataracts and the slowing of growth at the higher dose. These led to one trial stopping early. Follow‐up data show that catch‐up growth started two years after treatment ceased. Treatment must use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration of therapy to reduce the risk of a permanent effect on growth. A dose of 1 mg/kg on alternate days might be considered for up to 24 months, but close attention should be paid to adverse effects. We do not expect any further trials of this treatment to be undertaken, so we do not plan to continue to regularly update the review. However, if any new information is published, we will include this when it is available. This is an update of a previously published review.","12","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Administration, Oral; Anti-Inflammatory Agents [*administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Early Termination of Clinical Trials; Female; Glucocorticoids [*administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Growth [drug effects]; Humans; Male; Prednisolone [administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Tract Diseases [*drug therapy, etiology]; Sex Factors","10.1002/14651858.CD000407.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD000407.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD006659.PUB3","Nasser, M; Javaheri, H; Fedorowicz, Z; Noorani, Z","Carnitine supplementation for inborn errors of metabolism","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2012","Abstract - Background Inborn errors of metabolism are genetic conditions which can lead to abnormalities in the synthesis and metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, or fats. It has been proposed that in some instances carnitine supplementation should be provided to infants with a suspected metabolic disease as an interim measure, particularly whilst awaiting test results. Carnitine supplementation is used in the treatment of primary carnitine deficiency, and also where the deficiency is a secondary complication of several inborn errors of metabolism, such as organic acidaemias and fatty acid oxidation defects in children and adults. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of carnitine supplementation in the treatment of inborn errors of metabolism. Search methods We searched the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( The Cochrane Library  2007, Issue 4) and MEDLINE via Ovid (1950 to July week 4 2007), LILACS (15/05/2008) and Iranmedex (15/05/2008) and also the reference lists of retrieved articles. Date of most recent search of the Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Register: 27 October 2011. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing carnitine supplementation (in different dose, frequency, or duration) versus placebo in children and adults diagnosed with an inborn error of metabolism. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened and assessed the eligibility of the identified trials. Main results No trials were included in the review. Authors' conclusions There are no published or ongoing randomised controlled clinical trials relevant to this review question. Therefore, in the absence of any high level evidence, clinicians should base their decisions on clinical experience and in conjunction with preferences of the individual where appropriate. This does not mean that carnitine is ineffective or should not be used in any inborn error of metabolism. However, given the lack of evidence both on the effectiveness and safety of carnitine and on the necessary dose and frequency to be prescribed, the current prescribing practice should continue to be observed and monitored with care until further evidence is available. Methodologically sound trials, reported according to the  Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement , are required. It should be considered whether placebo‐controlled trials in potentially lethal diseases, e.g. carnitine transporter disorder or glutaric aciduria type I, are ethical. Plain language summary Carnitine supplements for treating people with inborn errors of metabolism Inborn errors of metabolism are genetic disorders which have a wide range of symptoms. These often start at or soon after birth but may appear first at any time during adulthood. Affected individuals may need to deal with symptoms of the disease throughout their lifetime. Symptoms are often non‐specific and may affect any organ. It can be difficult to diagnose an inborn error of metabolism. However, early detection is important and screening of infants for some disorders, such as phenylketonuria, is routine in several countries. It is recommended that carnitine supplements are prescribed in the diet of individuals with certain inborn errors of metabolism, along with other standard treatments. Carnitine supplements take the form of tablet, oral liquid, paediatric liquid and injection and might be taken with food for ease of administration. Unfortunately, we did not find any good quality trials to include in the review. This does not mean that carnitine is ineffective or should not be used in treating inborn errors of metabolism; however, individuals receiving carnitine should be carefully observed and monitored. Therefore, we recommend that clinicians base their decision to prescribe carnitine on clinical experience together with individual preferences. Future trials should include patient‐reported outcomes using validated and internationally recognised scales. Any adverse events associated with the treatment should be reported. It should be carefully considered whether placebo‐controlled trials in potentially lethal diseases, e.g. carnitine transporter disorder or glutaric aciduria type I, are ethical.","2","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Dietary Supplements; Carnitine [*administration & dosage]; Humans; Infant; Metabolism, Inborn Errors [*therapy]; Vitamin B Complex [*administration & dosage]","10.1002/14651858.CD006659.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006659.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD000406.PUB5","Smyth, RL; Rayner, O","Oral calorie supplements for cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2017","Abstract - Background Poor nutrition occurs frequently in people with cystic fibrosis and is associated with other adverse outcomes. Oral calorie supplements are used to increase total daily calorie intake and improve weight gain. However, they are expensive and there are concerns they may reduce the amount of food eaten and not improve overall energy intake. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To establish whether in people with cystic fibrosis, oral calorie supplements: increase daily calorie intake; and improve overall nutritional intake, nutritional indices, lung function, survival and quality of life. To assess adverse effects associated with using these supplements. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register comprising references from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We contacted companies marketing oral calorie supplements. Last search: 18 October 2016. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing use of oral calorie supplements for at least one month to increase calorie intake with no specific intervention or additional nutritional advice in people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis We independently selected the included trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted the authors of included trials and obtained additional information for two trials. Main results We identified 21 trials and included three, reporting results from 131 participants lasting between three months and one year. Two trials compared supplements to additional nutritional advice and one to no intervention. Two of the included trials recruited only children. In one trial the risk of bias was low across all domains, in a second trial the risk of bias was largely unclear and in the third mainly low. Blinding of participants was unclear in two of the trials. Also, in one trial the clinical condition of groups appeared to be unevenly balanced at baseline and in another trial there were concerns surrounding allocation concealment. There were no significant differences between people receiving supplements or dietary advice alone for change in weight, height, body mass index, z score or other indices of nutrition or growth. Changes in weight (kg) at three, six and 12 months respectively were: mean difference (MD) 0.32 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.09 to 0.72); MD 0.47 (95% CI ‐0.07 to 1.02 ); and MD 0.16 (‐0.68 to 1.00). Total calorie intake was greater in people taking supplements at 12 months, MD 265.70 (95% CI 42.94 to 488.46). There were no significant differences between the groups for anthropometric measures of body composition, lung function, gastro‐intestinal adverse effects or activity levels. Moderate quality evidence exists for the outcomes of changes in weight and height and low quality evidence exists for the outcomes of change in total calories, total fat and total protein intake as results are applicable only to children between the ages of 2 and 15 years and many post‐treatment diet diaries were not returned. Evidence for the rate of adverse events in the treatment groups was extremely limited and judged to be of very low quality Authors' conclusions Oral calorie supplements do not confer any additional benefit in the nutritional management of moderately malnourished children with cystic fibrosis over and above the use of dietary advice and monitoring alone. While nutritional supplements may be used, they should not be regarded as essential. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to establish the role of short‐term oral protein energy supplements in people with cystic fibrosis and acute weight loss and also for the long‐term nutritional management of adults with cystic fibrosis or advanced lung disease, or both. Plain language summary Use of oral supplements to increase calorie intake in people with cystic fibrosis We reviewed the evidence for the use of oral supplements to increase calorie intake in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Cystic fibrosis affects many organs, including the digestive system, and can lead to food not being absorbed as it should be, which in turn leads to growth problems. Children with cystic fibrosis need more energy than other children, but they often have reduced appetites. Poor diet has been linked to poor outcomes in cystic fibrosis. Milks or juices containing additional calories are often added to the diets of children with cystic fibrosis to increase their total daily calorie intake and help them gain weight. However, these supplements are expensive and may not achieve the desired effect if patients take them as a substitute for calories consumed from food rather than as an additional component. In toddlers or young children use of supplements may risk compromising the development of normal eating behaviour. This is an updated version of the review. Search date We last searched for evidence on 18 October 2016. Study characteristics This review includes three randomised controlled trials with a total of 131 participants and two of them only included children. Two of the trials compared supplements to dietary advice and one compared supplements to no advice. The trials lasted between three months and one year. Key results There were no major differences between people receiving supplements or just dietary advice for any nutritional or growth measurements. This was also true for measures of body composition, lung function, adverse effects on the digestive system or people's levels of activity. Advice and monitoring appear to be enough to manage the diet of moderately malnourished children. Future trials should look into the use of calorie supplements for acute weight loss or long‐term care for adults with cystic fibrosis. Quality of the evidence One of the trials appeared to be well run and the risk of bias was low for all the aspects of trial design that we assessed; so we do not think any bias will influence the results in a negative way. In the other two trials, we were not sure if the people taking part could guess which treatment group they were in. In one of these two trials, we further thought it was likely that the person recruiting them to the trial knew which group the participant would be in. In the second of these trials, the people in the group receiving supplements appeared to be generally in better clinical condition at the start of the trial than those who didn't receive any supplements or advice. These factors affect our confidence in the results from these trials. We judged the quality of the evidence for the changes in weight and height to be moderate, but judged the quality of the evidence for the changes in total calories, total fat and total protein intake as low since results are applicable only to children aged between 2 and 15 years; also many post‐treatment diet diaries were not returned to the investigators. Evidence for the rate of adverse events in the treatment groups was extremely limited and judged to be of very low quality.","5","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Dietary Supplements [adverse effects]; *Energy Intake; Administration, Oral; Adult; Child; Child Nutrition Disorders [*diet therapy, etiology]; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD000406.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD000406.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Progressive renal insufficiency is a major source of morbidity, additional complications result from cardio‐ and cerebro‐vascular involvement. Survival is reduced among affected males and symptomatic female carriers. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2010, and previously updated in 2013. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of enzyme replacement therapy compared to other interventions, placebo or no interventions, for treating Anderson‐Fabry disease. Search methods We searched the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register (date of the most recent search: 08 July 2016). We also searched 'Clinical Trials' on  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS (date of the most recent search: 24 September 2015). Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials of agalsidase alfa or beta in participants diagnosed with Anderson‐Fabry disease. Data collection and analysis Two authors selected relevant trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. Main results Nine trials comparing either agalsidase alfa or beta in 351 participants fulfilled the selection criteria. Both trials comparing agalsidase alfa to placebo reported on globotriaosylceramide concentration in plasma and tissue; aggregate results were non‐significant. One trial reported pain scores measured by the Brief Pain Inventory severity, there was a statistically significant improvement for participants receiving treatment at up to three months, mean difference ‐2.10 (95% confidence interval ‐3.79 to ‐0.41; at up to five months, mean difference ‐1.90 (95% confidence interval ‐3.65 to ‐0.15); and at up to six months, mean difference ‐2.00 (95% confidence interval ‐3.66 to ‐0.34). There was a significant difference in the Brief Pain Inventory pain‐related quality of life at over five months and up to six months, mean difference ‐2.10 (95% confidence interval ‐3.92 to ‐0.28) but not at other time points. Death was not an outcome in either of the trials. One of the three trials comparing agalsidase beta to placebo reported on globotriaosylceramide concentration in plasma and tissue and showed significant improvement: kidney, mean difference ‐1.70 (95% confidence interval ‐2.09 to ‐1.31); heart, mean difference ‐0.90 (95% confidence interval ‐1.18 to ‐0.62); and composite results (renal, cardiac, and cerebrovascular complications and death), mean difference ‐4.80 (95% confidence interval ‐5.45 to ‐4.15). There was no significant difference between groups for death; no trials reported on pain. Only two trials compared agalsidase alfa to agalsidase beta. One of them showed no significant difference between the groups regarding adverse events, risk ratio 0.36 (95% confidence interval 0.08 to 1.59), or any serious adverse events; risk ratio 0.30; (95% confidence interval 0.03 to 2.57). Two trials compared different dosing schedules of agalsidase alfa. One of them involved three different doses (0.2 mg/kg every two weeks; 0.1 mg/kg weekly and; 0.2 mg/kg weekly), the other trial evaluated two further doses to the dosage schedules: 0.4 mg/kg every week and every other week. Both trials failed to show significant differences with various dosing schedules on globotriaosylceramide levels. No significant differences were found among the schedules for the primary efficacy outcome of self‐assessed health state, or for pain scores. One trial comparing agalsidase alfa to agalsidase beta showed no significant difference for any adverse events such as dyspnoea and hypertension. The methodological quality of the included trials was generally unclear for the random sequence generation and allocation concealment. Authors' conclusions Trials comparing enzyme replacement therapy to placebo show significant improvement with enzyme replacement therapy in regard to microvascular endothelial deposits of globotriaosylceramide and in pain‐related quality of life. There is, however, no evidence identifying if the alfa or beta form is superior or the optimal dose or frequency of enzyme replacement therapy. With regards to safety, adverse events (i.e., rigors, fever) were more significant in the agalsidase beta as compared to placebo. The long‐term influence of enzyme replacement therapy on risk of morbidity and mortality related to Anderson‐Fabry disease remains to be established. This review highlights the need for continued research into the use of enzyme replacement therapy for Anderson‐Fabry disease. Plain language summary Treatment for Anderson‐Fabry disease Background Anderson‐Fabry disease, a rare disorder, is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme alpha‐galactosidase A. This leads to the build‐up of a fatty material called globotriaosylceramide in various cells in the body. Globotriaosylceramide is formed of three sugars and a fatty substance called ceramide, and is found in most cells of the body. Untreated individuals may suffer from pain, skin, eye and gastrointestinal problems. Fabry disease may cause potentially life‐threatening complications such as kidney damage, heart attack and stroke. One type of treatment available is enzyme replacement therapy with either agalsidase alfa or beta, which replaces the missing or deficient enzyme. Search date The evidence is current to: 08 July 2016. Study characteristics Nine studies enrolled 351 participants. The studies used different formulations of the enzyme, Agalsidase alfa or beta, and compared them to placebo (a 'dummy' treatment) or to each other. Comparison was also made in regard to different dosing schedules. Key results Two studies comparing agalsidase alfa to placebo reported on globotriaosylceramide concentration in plasma. The combined effects were not significant between the treatment and placebo groups. The study that reported pain and pain‐related quality of life showed an improvement for participants receiving treatment over the six‐month observation period. Death was not an outcome in either study. One of the three studies comparing agalsidase beta to placebo reported on globotriaosylceramide and showed improvement in kidney, heart and composite results. There was no significant difference for death and no studies reported on pain. Only two studies compared agalsidase alfa to agalsidase beta. One of them showed no significant difference for any adverse events such as dyspnoea, hypertension and gastrointestinal symptoms ‐ these are not adverse events as gastrointestinal problems are actually a symptom, as may be hypertension in the context of renal disease. Two studies compared different dosing schedules of agalsidase alfa. No differences were found among the schedules for self‐assessed health state or for pain scores. In summary, studies comparing enzyme replacement therapy to placebo show significant results in regard to microvascular endothelial deposits of globotriaosylceramide and in pain‐related quality of life. There is, however, no evidence identifying if the alfa or beta form is superior, though included trials were small in sample size. With regards to safety, adverse events (i.e., rigors, fever) were more significant with agalsidase beta as compared to placebo. Quality of the evidence   From the information available in most of the study reports, we were not able to clearly judge whether all volunteers had equal chances of being in either of the treatment groups and whether they would have known in advance or during the study which treatment they were receiving.","7","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Enzyme Replacement Therapy [*methods]; Fabry Disease [*drug therapy, enzymology]; Female; Humans; Isoenzymes [*administration & dosage]; Male; Pain Measurement; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Recombinant Proteins; Time Factors; Trihexosylceramides [analysis, blood]; alpha‐Galactosidase [*administration & dosage]","10.1002/14651858.CD006663.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006663.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD008889.PUB2","de Oliveira Carvalho, PE; da Silva, MVM; Rodrigues, OR; Cataneo, AJM","Surgical interventions for treating pectus excavatum","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2014","Abstract - Background Pectus excavatum is characterized by a depression of the anterior chest wall (sternum and lower costal cartilages) and is the most frequently occurring chest wall deformity. The prevalence ranges from 6.28 to 12 cases per 1000 around the world. Generally pectus excavatum is present at birth or is identified after a few weeks or months; however, sometimes it becomes evident only at puberty. The consequence of the condition on a individual’s life is variable, some live a normal life and others have physical and psychological symptoms such as: precordial pain after exercises; impairments of pulmonary and cardiac function; shyness and social isolation. For many years, sub‐perichondrial resection of the costal cartilages, with or without transverse cuneiform osteotomy of the sternum and placement of a substernal support, called conventional surgery, was the most accepted option for surgical repair of these patients. From 1997 a new surgical repair called, minimally invasive surgery, became available. This less invasive surgical option consists of the retrosternal placement of a curved metal bar, without resections of the costal cartilages or sternum osteotomy, and is performed by videothoracoscopy. However, many aspects that relate to the benefits and harms of both techniques have not been defined. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the conventional surgery compared with minimally invasive surgery for treating people with pectus excavatum. Search methods With the aim of increasing the sensitivity of the search strategy we used only terms related to the individual’s condition (pectus excavatum); terms related to the interventions, outcomes and types of studies were not included. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, LILACS, and ICTPR. Additionally we searched yet reference lists of articles and conference proceedings. All searches were done without language restriction. Date of the most recent searches: 14 January 2014. Selection criteria We considered randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled trials that compared traditional surgery with minimally invasive surgery for treating pectus excavatum. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of the trials identified and agreed trial eligibility after a consensus meeting. The authors also assessed the risk of bias of the eligible trials. Main results Initially we located 4111 trials from the electronic searches and two further trials from other resources. All trials were added into reference management software and the duplicates were excluded, leaving 2517 studies. The titles and abstracts of these 2517 studies were independently analyzed by two authors and finally eight trials were selected for full text analysis, after which they were all excluded, as they did not fulfil the inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions There is no evidence from randomized controlled trials to conclude what is the best surgical option to treat people with pectus excavatum. Plain language summary Surgical treatments for pectus excavatum Pectus excavatum is characterized by a depression (sunken appearance) of the anterior (front) chest wall (sternum and lower costal cartilages); it is the most common chest wall defect. The frequency ranges from 6.28 to 12 cases per 1000 around the world. It is generally regarded as a genetic condition, based on the fact that it is usually present in several members of the same family and is often associated with other genetic diseases; however, its causes remain in debate. To what degree the disorder affects the individual's life is variable, some will live a normal life and others can have physical and psychological symptoms such as: precordial pain after exercises; problems with pulmonary and cardiac function; shyness and social isolation. Many types of non‐surgical treatments have been tried, among them there are physical and respiratory exercises and different methods or devices to put pressure on the elevated parts of the chest wall or do traction in the depressed parts. Despite these different options of conservative treatment, the widespread treatment is that of surgical correction. For many years the surgical correction was based on the resections of the deformed costal cartilages (which aim to extend the ribs forward and contribute to the elasticity of the walls of the thorax (area between abdomen and neck)) and the placement of a support behind of the externum to move it forward. Since 1997 a new surgical technique became available, the externum is displaced forward by the placement of a metal bar behind it, the bar is placed by video‐assisted throat surgery and the costal cartilage is resected. However, there is a debate if one surgery is better (reach a better result with less complications) than the other. To clarify this question we performed a systematic review, but, no trials were eligible for inclusion.

Prophylaxis has long been used but not universally adopted because of medical, psychosocial, and cost controversies. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of clotting factor concentrate prophylaxis in the management of people with hemophilia A or B. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register. In addition, we searched major electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL), handsearched relevant journals and abstract books and reference lists of relevant articles. Last search of Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register: 07 April 2011. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised controlled trials evaluating people with severe hemophilia A or hemophilia B receiving prophylactic clotting factor concentrates. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently reviewed studies for eligibility, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Main results Six studies (including 142 participants) were eligible for inclusion. Two compared three‐times‐a‐week prophylactic administration with on‐demand treatment in children with hemophilia. Pooled results from these two studies showed a rate ratio of 0.30 (95% confidence interval; 0.12 to 0.76) for all bleedings and 0.22 (95% confidence interval 0.08 to 0.63) for joint bleedings favouring prophylaxis. Results on the number of patients with preserved joints after three to seven years of follow‐up were not pooled due to significant heterogeneity. Three of the remaining four studies evaluated hemophilia A; one showed a statistically significant decrease in frequency of joint bleeds with prophylaxis compared to placebo, with a rate difference of ‐10.73 (95% confidence interval ‐16.55 to ‐4.91) bleeds per year. Two studies compared two prophylaxis regimens, failing to demonstrate an advantage of one regimen over the other in terms of bleeding frequency. The fourth study evaluated hemophilia B and showed fewer joint bleeds with weekly (15 IU/kg) versus bi‐weekly (7.5 IU/kg) prophylaxis, rate difference ‐3.30 (95% confidence interval ‐5.50 to ‐1.10) bleeds per year. Non‐significant increases in both inhibitor and infectious complications were observed in patients on prophylaxis, which occurred more often when using long‐term venous access. Authors' conclusions There is strong evidence from randomised controlled trials and observational trials that prophylaxis preserves joint function in children with hemophilia as compared to on‐demand treatment. There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to confirm the observational evidence that prophylaxis decreases bleeding and related complications in patients with existing joint damage. Well‐designed randomised controlled trials and prospective observational controlled studies are needed to establish the best prophylactic regimen and to assess the effectiveness of prophylactic clotting factor concentrates in adult patients. Plain language summary Regular clotting factor replacement therapy to prevent joint disease in people with severe hemophilia A or B Hemophilia A and B are X‐linked inherited bleeding disorders, in which the major clinical problem is repeated bleeding into joints. As this disorder progresses, joints become deformed and movement limited. Current therapy for treating and preventing bleeding includes plasma‐derived or recombinant clotting factor concentrates. This review includes six randomised controlled trials. Two compare the regular use of clotting factor concentrates to prevent joint bleeds with their use 'on demand'. Four compare different regimens of regular use in children and adults with hemophilia. It was clearly evident that preventative therapy, as intravenous infusion of factor concentrate repeated more times a week and started early in childhood was able to reduce joint deterioration as compared to treatment administered after bleeding occurred. This favourable effect is due to a consistent reduction in total bleeds and hemarthrosis (bleeding into joints) and leads to a significant improvement in quality of life. Preventative therapy is linked to an increased factor usage and cost of treatment. We found weaker evidence (due to lack of data) to show preventative therapy reduced joint deterioration when treatment is started after joint damage has been established. Further studies are needed to establish the best preventative regimen, i.e. for example starting time, dosage frequency, minimally effective dose.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Blood Coagulation Factors [*therapeutic use]; Factor VIII [*therapeutic use]; Hemarthrosis [*prevention & control]; Hemophilia A [*complications]; Hemophilia B [*complications]; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD003429.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003429.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Bronchial hyper‐responsiveness may be a component of acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease. Therefore, bronchodilators may be useful in the treatment of acute chest syndrome. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives The aim of the review is to determine whether the use of inhaled, short‐acting bronchodilators for acute chest syndrome reduces morbidity and mortality in people with sickle cell disease and to assess whether this treatment causes adverse effects. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Additional searches were carried out on MEDLINE (1966 to 2004) and Embase (1981 to 2004) and ongoing trial registries (28 September 2022).

Trials using quasi‐randomisation methods will be included in future updates of this review if there is sufficient evidence that the treatment and control groups are similar at baseline. Data collection and analysis We found no trials investigating the use of bronchodilators for acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease. Main results We found no trials investigating the use of bronchodilators for acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease. Authors' conclusions If bronchial hyper‐responsiveness is an important component of some episodes of acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease, the use of inhaled bronchodilators may be indicated. There is need for a well‐designed, adequately‐powered randomised controlled trial to assess the benefits and risks of the addition of inhaled bronchodilators to established therapies for acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease. Plain language summary Inhaled drugs for opening up the airways in cases of acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease Review question Can inhaled, short‐acting bronchodilators for acute chest syndrome reduce illness and mortality in people with sickle cell disease and does this treatment cause adverse effects?  Background Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder. People with sickle cell disease often suffer from acute chest syndrome. Acute chest syndrome can cause fever, coughing, chest pain and shortness of breath and can be life‐threatening. Often, people with sickle cell disease and acute chest syndrome also wheeze. Wheezing suggests that airways are narrowed, as with asthma. Bronchodilators are drugs which relax the muscles in the airways, so they open up to make breathing easier. They are used in this way for asthma, so may be of similar use in acute chest syndrome. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Search date The evidence is current to: 25 July 2022. Study characteristics We found no trials to show the effects of these drugs for this condition.

Management of the resulting anaemia is through red blood cell transfusions. Repeated transfusions result in an excessive accumulation of iron in the body (iron overload), removal of which is achieved through iron chelation therapy. A commonly used iron chelator, deferiprone, has been found to be pharmacologically efficacious. However, important questions exist about the efficacy and safety of deferiprone compared to another iron chelator, desferrioxamine. Objectives To summarise data from trials on the clinical efficacy and safety of deferiprone and to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of deferiprone with desferrioxamine for thalassaemia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies trials Register and MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL ( The Cochrane Library),  LILACS and other international medical databases, plus registers of ongoing trials and the Transfusion Evidence Library (www.transfusionevidencelibrary.com). We also contacted the manufacturers of deferiprone and desferrioxamine. All searches were updated to 05 March 2013. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing deferiprone with another iron chelator; or comparing two schedules or doses of deferiprone, in people with transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trials for risk of bias and extracted data. Missing data were requested from the original investigators. Main results A total of 17 trials involving 1061 participants (range 13 to 213 participants per trial) were included. Of these, 16 trials compared either deferiprone alone with desferrioxamine alone, or a combined therapy of deferiprone and desferrioxamine with either deferiprone alone or desferrioxamine alone; one compared different schedules of deferiprone. There was little consistency between outcomes and limited information to fully assess the risk of bias of most of the included trials. Four trials reported mortality; each reported the death of one individual receiving deferiprone with or without desferrioxamine. One trial reported five further deaths in patients who withdrew from randomised treatment (deferiprone with or without desferrioxamine) and switched to desferrioxamine alone. Seven trials reported cardiac function or liver fibrosis as measures of end organ damage. Earlier trials measuring the cardiac iron load indirectly by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2* signal had suggested deferiprone may reduce cardiac iron more quickly than desferrioxamine. However, a meta‐analysis of two trials suggested that left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly reduced in patients who received desferrioxamine alone compared with combination therapy.   One trial, which planned five years of follow up, was stopped early due to the beneficial effects of combined treatment compared with deferiprone alone in terms of serum ferritin levels reduction. The results of this and three other trials suggest an advantage of combined therapy over monotherapy to reduce iron stores as measured by serum ferritin. There is, however, no conclusive or consistent evidence for the improved efficacy of combined deferiprone and desferrioxamine therapy over monotherapy from direct or indirect measures of liver iron. Both deferiprone and desferrioxamine produce a significant reduction in iron stores in transfusion‐dependent, iron‐overloaded people. There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to suggest that either has a greater reduction of clinically significant end organ damage. Evidence of adverse events were observed in all treatment groups. Occurrence of any adverse event was significantly more likely with deferiprone than desferrioxamine in one trial, RR 2.24 (95% CI 1.19 to 4.23). Meta‐analysis of a further two trials showed a significant increased risk of adverse events associated with combined deferiprone and desferrioxamine compared with desferrioxamine alone, RR 3.04 (95% CI 1.18 to 7.83). The most commonly reported adverse event was joint pain, which occurred significantly more frequently in patients receiving deferiprone than desferrioxamine, RR 2.64 (95% CI 1.21 to 5.77). Other common adverse events included gastrointestinal disturbances as well as neutropenia or leucopenia, or both. Authors' conclusions In the absence of data from randomised controlled trials, there is no evidence to suggest the need for a change in current treatment recommendations; namely that deferiprone is indicated for treating iron overload in people with thalassaemia major when desferrioxamine is contraindicated or inadequate. Intensified desferrioxamine treatment (by either subcutaneous or intravenous route) or use of other oral iron chelators, or both, remains the established treatment to reverse cardiac dysfunction due to iron overload. Indeed, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently only gave support for deferiprone to be used as a last resort for treating iron overload in thalassaemia, myelodysplasia and sickle cell disease. However, there is evidence that adverse events are increased in patients treated with deferiprone compared with desferrioxamine and in patients treated with combined deferiprone and desferrioxamine compared with desferrioxamine alone. There is an urgent need for adequately‐powered, high‐quality trials comparing the overall clinical efficacy and long‐term outcome of deferiprone with desferrioxamine. Plain language summary The use of the iron chelator deferiprone in people with thalassaemia who are dependent on blood transfusions In thalassaemia sometimes the body cannot produce enough haemoglobin. Regular blood transfusions can manage this, but may lead to excess iron in the body, which, if not removed, may damage major organs. Iron chelation therapy removes excess iron; one common chelator is deferiprone. Questions exist about whether deferiprone is as good and safe as the most widely‐used iron chelator, desferrioxamine. Desferrioxamine is administered by a needle under the skin or into a vein, and was the standard monotherapy for 20 years. Seventeen randomised controlled trials compared deferiprone with desferrioxamine. They report little data on death or end organ damage, so we report the effects of therapy using mainly other markers. Removing excess iron was assessed by iron concentration in the blood and liver; heart function; and the amount of iron passed in urine. However, the amount of iron removed with either deferiprone or desferrioxamine was not consistent; one reason being that outcomes were measured differently. This makes it difficult to compare results between trials. Adverse events included joint pain, nausea, stomach upsets and low white blood cell count with deferiprone and pain or skin reactions at the injection site and joint pain with desferrioxamine. In one trial, the risk of an adverse event with deferiprone was twice that of the risk with desferrioxamine. Two further trials showed a three‐fold increased risk of an adverse event with combined deferiprone and desferrioxamine therapy compared with desferrioxamine alone. We found no evidence to change current recommendations to treat iron overload in thalassaemia with deferiprone when desferrioxamine cannot be used or is inadequate. Intensified desferrioxamine treatment or use of other oral iron chelators (or both of these) remains the established treatment to reverse heart problems due to iron overload. Indeed, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently gave support for deferiprone only to be used as a last resort treatment in patients with thalassaemia, myelodysplasia and sickle cell disease. The danger of raised liver enzymes or a very low white blood cell count with deferiprone means that this treatment should not be used unless close monitoring of full blood counts and liver function is possible. Large trials of chelation therapy with standardised measures of iron stores and end organ damage are needed so valuable trial data can be compared and analysed.","8","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Administration, Oral; Chelation Therapy [*adverse effects]; Deferiprone; Deferoxamine [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Humans; Iron Chelating Agents [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Iron Overload [*drug therapy, etiology]; Pyridones [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Thalassemia [*therapy]; Treatment Outcome","10.1002/14651858.CD004839.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004839.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Many types of nebuliser systems are available for use with various medications; however, there has been no previous systematic review which has evaluated these systems. Objectives To evaluate effectiveness, safety, burden of treatment and adherence to nebulised therapy using different nebuliser systems for people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We searched the reference lists of each study for additional publications and approached the manufacturers of both nebuliser systems and nebulised medications for published and unpublished data.     Date of the most recent search: 15 Oct 2012. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing nebuliser systems including conventional nebulisers, vibrating mesh technology systems, adaptive aerosol delivery systems and ultrasonic nebuliser systems. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. They also independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. A third author assessed studies where agreement could not be reached. Main results The search identified 40 studies with 20 of these (1936 participants) included in the review. These studies compared the delivery of tobramycin, colistin, dornase alfa, hypertonic sodium chloride and other solutions through the different nebuliser systems. This review demonstrates variability in the delivery of medication depending on the nebuliser system used. Conventional nebuliser systems providing higher flows, higher respirable fractions and smaller particles decrease treatment time, increase deposition and may be preferred by people with CF, as compared to conventional nebuliser systems providing lower flows, lower respirable fractions and larger particles. Nebulisers using adaptive aerosol delivery or vibrating mesh technology reduce treatment time to a far greater extent. Deposition (as a percentage of priming dose) is greater than conventional with adaptive aerosol delivery. Vibrating mesh technology systems may give greater deposition than conventional when measuring sputum levels, but lower deposition when measuring serum levels or using gamma scintigraphy. The available data indicate that these newer systems are safe when used with an appropriate priming dose, which may be different to the priming dose used for conventional systems. There is an indication that adherence is maintained or improved with systems which use these newer technologies, but also that some nebuliser systems using vibrating mesh technology may be subject to increased failures. Authors' conclusions Clinicians should be aware of the variability in the performance of different nebuliser systems. Technologies such as adaptive aerosol delivery and vibrating mesh technology have advantages over conventional systems in terms of treatment time, deposition as a percentage of priming dose, patient preference and adherence. There is a need for long‐term randomised controlled trials of these technologies to determine patient‐focused outcomes (such as quality of life and burden of care), safe and effective dosing levels of medications and clinical outcomes (such as hospitalisations and need for antibiotics) and an economic evaluation of their use. Plain language summary Nebulisers for giving medication in cystic fibrosis Nebulisers change a liquid medication into a mist so it can be breathed in. There are different types of nebuliser systems and no review has yet considered whether any nebuliser is better than another. 1. Conventional nebuliser systems ‐ a machine sucks air in and pushes it out at high speed; a tube attaches the machine to a chamber holding the medication where the air breaks it up into a mist. The mist of medication is delivered constantly. 2. Adaptive aerosol delivery nebuliser systems ‐ use conventional technology as described above, but also monitor breathing and deliver the mist of medication only while the person is breathing in. 3. Adaptive aerosol delivery nebuliser systems with vibrating mesh technology ‐ monitor breathing and deliver the mist of medication only while the person is breathing in and use vibrating mesh technology, as described below, to change the liquid medication into a mist. 4. Vibrating mesh technology nebuliser systems ‐ move the liquid medication through a metal mesh to break up the liquid into a mist where each drop is a similar size; they deliver the mist of medication constantly. 5. Ultrasonic nebuliser systems ‐ use a crystal to vibrate the liquid medication at a high‐frequency to break up the liquid medication into a mist; they deliver the mist of medication constantly. We included 20 studies (1936 participants) in this review which compared the delivery of tobramycin, colistin, dornase alfa, hypertonic sodium chloride and other nebulised medications through the different types of nebuliser. Some conventional nebuliser systems have faster air flows and smaller medication droplets. These systems decrease treatment time and deliver more medication into the lung than other conventional nebulisers which have slower air flows and larger medication droplets. Nebulisers using newer technologies, e.g. adaptive aerosol delivery or vibrating mesh technology, deliver the medication faster and may deliver more of the medication into the lung. These systems appear safe when used with the correct amount of medication, which may be different to that used in a conventional nebuliser system. Some studies suggest that people with cystic fibrosis may prefer these newer systems and may take more of their medication when using them. More research is needed into what dose of medication is needed and how these newer nebuliser technologies affect quality of life, burden of treatment, additional treatment needed and treatment costs.","4","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Nebulizers and Vaporizers; Aerosols; Albuterol [administration & dosage]; Anti-Bacterial Agents [administration & dosage]; Bronchodilator Agents [administration & dosage]; Carbenicillin [administration & dosage]; Colistin [administration & dosage]; Cromolyn Sodium [administration & dosage]; Cystic Fibrosis [*drug therapy]; Deoxyribonuclease I [administration & dosage]; Drug Delivery Systems; Humans; Medication Adherence; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Recombinant Proteins [administration & dosage]; Saline Solution, Hypertonic [administration & dosage]; Tobramycin [administration & dosage]","10.1002/14651858.CD007639.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007639.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Currently, immune tolerance induction is the only known intervention to successfully eradicate inhibitors. However, ideal dosing regimens, and the comparative safety and efficacy of different immune tolerance induction regimens have not yet been established. Objectives The objective of this review was to assess the effects of immune tolerance induction (different protocols of this therapy versus each other, or versus only bypassing agents) for treating inhibitors in people with congenital haemophilia A or B. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched: MEDLINE (from 1946 to 15 July 2013); Embase (from 1980 to 15 July 2013) via the OVID platform; CINAHL (from conception to 15 July 2013); and ClinicalTrials.gov (most recent search: 15 July 2013). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing either different immune tolerance induction regimens or immune tolerance induction versus only bypassing therapy for the eradication of factor inhibitory antibodies in patients with congenital haemophilia A or B. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently completed data collection, extraction and assessment of the risk of bias of trials. Main results One methodologically sound randomised controlled trial met the inclusion criteria and was included in the review. One further randomised controlled trial has been recently stopped, but it has not yet been reported. The included multinational trial randomised 115 paediatric participants with severe haemophilia A and high‐responding inhibitors, for whom this was the first attempt at immune tolerance induction, to receive either a low dose (50 IU/kg of factor VIII concentrate three times per week) or a high dose (200 IU/kg of factor VIII daily). Although, there was no statistically significant difference in the success of immune tolerance induction between treatment arms, the confidence intervals were too wide to infer no effect: 24 out of 58 participants (46.6%) in the low‐dose group and 22 out of 57 (38.6%) in the high‐dose group experiencing full tolerance, risk ratio 1.07 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.68) (moderate quality evidence). The rate of infection was not statistically different between groups, but again confidence intervals were too wide. Of those patients who had a central venous catheter device, 19 out of 47 participants (40.4%) in the low‐dose arm had 69 infections, and 22 out of 52 participants (42.3%) in the high‐dose arm had 55 infections, risk ratio 0.96 (95% CI 0.60 to 1.53) (moderate quality evidence). However, participants in the low‐dose immune tolerance induction group experienced significantly more bleeding episodes (50 out of 58 participants (86.2%) experienced one or more bleeding events) than those in the high‐dose group (36 out of 57 participants (63.1%) experienced one or more bleeding events), risk ratio 1.36 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.71) (low quality evidence). One factor VIII reaction, one incidence of trauma and 13 incidences of needing to insert or remove the catheter were reported as trial‐related serious adverse events; however, the treatment group where these events occurred was not specified. No incidence of nephrotic syndrome was reported. Authors' conclusions We did not find any randomised controlled trial‐based comparison of immune tolerance induction with alternate treatment schemes (i.e. bypassing agents for bleeding only). In a single randomised trial, there were no significant differences in the immune tolerance induction success rate between different dosing regimens, which may have been due to imprecision of the estimate. There is low‐quality evidence to suggest that high‐dose immune tolerance induction may induce tolerance more quickly which is associated with fewer bleeding complications. The choice of immune tolerance induction regimen should be considered individually for each case, until further research provides additional evidence. Plain language summary Immune tolerance induction to destroy inhibitors in people with haemophilia A or B Review question We reviewed evidence about the effect of immune tolerance induction to remove inhibitors in people with haemophilia A and B. Background Haemophilia A and B are inherited bleeding disorders, where affected people are missing a clotting factor in their blood, which is needed for normal blood clotting. Without this factor, people with haemophilia cannot make proper clots, and they may bleed for a much longer time than normal after an injury, or may experience sudden and unexpected bleeding inside the body and into joints. These bleeding incidents can cause permanent damage to the affected area and can be life threatening. The current treatment for haemophilia is replacement therapy, where the missing clotting factor is injected into the blood. Sometimes, when the missing clotting factor is introduced, the person's immune system will think it is a foreign body, and try to eliminate it with molecules called inhibitors. When a person with haemophilia develops an inhibitor, the injected clotting factor is destroyed before it can stop the bleeding. This is a very serious problem that affects almost one in three people with haemophilia A and approximately one in 30 people with haemophilia B. Immune tolerance induction is a treatment to make the immune system get used to the clotting factor, so that it no longer rejects the factor. This treatment, which involves giving large doses of factor concentrate, is currently used at different doses. We are unsure of how the dosing options work and how safe they are. To discover this, we searched the evidence until July 2013. Trial characteristics We found one randomised trial that compared high‐ and low‐dose immune tolerance induction, which included 115 males with haemophilia A and inhibitors. Key results and conclusions The single included trial was too small to be certain that both doses of immune tolerance induction were equally successful at removing inhibitors. However, the high‐dose treatment destroyed all inhibitors faster and with less bleeding events than the low‐dose treatment. Since there was only one available trial, further trials are needed to establish the best immune tolerance induction regimen with respect to starting time, dosing intensity and frequency.","4","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Immune Tolerance; Early Termination of Clinical Trials; Factor VIII [*administration & dosage, immunology]; Hemophilia A [immunology, *therapy]; Hemophilia B [immunology, *therapy]; Humans; Immunosuppression Therapy [*methods]; Male","10.1002/14651858.CD010561.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010561.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Psychological interventions are largely concerned with adherence to treatment, emotional and social adaptation and health‐related quality of life. We are unaware of any relevant systematic reviews. Objectives To determine whether psychological interventions for people with cystic fibrosis provide significant psychosocial and physical benefits in addition to standard medical care. Search methods Studies were identified from two Cochrane trials registers (Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group; Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group), Ovid MEDLINE and PsychINFO; unpublished trials were located through professional networks and Listserves. Most recent search of the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's register: 19 December 2013. Most recent search of the Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's register: 12 November 2013. Selection criteria Randomised controlled studies of a broad range of psychological interventions evaluating subjective and objective health outcomes, such as quality of life or pulmonary function, in individuals of all ages with cystic fibrosis and their immediate family. We were interested in psychological interventions, including psychological methods within the scope of psychotherapeutic or psychosomatic mechanism of action (e.g. cognitive behavioural, cognitive, family systems or systemic, psycho‐dynamic, or other, e.g. supportive, relaxation, or biofeedback), which were aimed at improving psychological and psychosocial outcomes (e.g. quality of life, levels of stress or distress, psychopathology, etc.), adaptation to disease management and physiological outcomes. Data collection and analysis Three authors were involved in selecting the eligible studies and two of these authors assessed their risk of bias. Main results The review includes 16 studies (eight new studies included in this update) representing data from 556 participants. Studies are diverse in their design and their methods. They cover interventions with generic approaches, as well as interventions developed specifically to target disease‐specific symptoms and problems in people with cystic fibrosis. These include cognitive behavioural interventions to improve adherence to nutrition or psychosocial adjustment, cognitive interventions to improve adherence or those associated with decision making in lung transplantation, a community‐based support intervention and other interventions, such as self‐hypnosis, respiratory muscle biofeedback, music therapy, dance and movement therapy, and a tele‐medicine intervention to support patients awaiting transplantation. A substantial proportion of outcomes relate to adherence, changes in physical status or other specific treatment concerns during the chronic phase of the disease. There is some evidence that behavioural interventions targeting nutrition and growth in children (4 to 12 years) with cystic fibrosis are effective in the short term. Evidence was found that providing a structured decision‐making tool for patients considering lung transplantation improves patients' knowledge of and expectations about the transplant, and reduces decisional conflict in the short term. One study about training in biofeedback‐assisted breathing demonstrated some evidence that it improved some lung function measurements. Currently there is insufficient evidence for interventions aimed at other aspects of the disease process. Authors' conclusions Currently, insufficient evidence exists on psychological interventions or approaches to support people with cystic fibrosis and their caregivers, although some of the studies were promising. Due to the heterogeneity between studies, more of each type of intervention are needed to support preliminary evidence. Multicentre studies, with consequent funding implications, are needed to increase the sample size of these studies and enhance the statistical power and precision to detect important findings. In addition, multicentre studies could improve the generalisation of results by minimizing centre or therapist effects. Psychological interventions should be targeted to illness‐specific symptoms or behaviours to demonstrate efficacy. Plain language summary Psychological treatments to help individuals with cystic fibrosis and their caregivers manage the disease Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that damages many of the body's organs and can shorten a person's life span. The disease is progressive, stressful to manage, and needs complex and time‐consuming treatments, leaving patients and caregivers stressed due to the challenges of the treatment. Thus, individuals with cystic fibrosis and their family members often need help to cope better and to deal with their thoughts and feelings. They also need assistance in managing the demands of the prescribed treatment schedules. In addition, infection control guidelines recommend the isolation of people with cystic fibrosis from others with the same disease, leading to a lack of peer support and potential social isolation. We looked for studies of psychological treatments in individuals of all ages with cystic fibrosis and their families which aimed to reduce anxiety and depression, to improve adjustment, quality of life, and even medical outcomes, as well as knowledge, skills, and decisions regarding care. The review includes 16 studies with a total of 556 participants. Even though there many different psychological interventions, only a few have been evaluated for individuals with CF and their families. Due to the lack of high quality studies, it is not possible to currently show which psychological treatments are most helpful to those with cystic fibrosis and their caregivers. Five out of the 16 studies we found evaluated behavioural interventions to improve dietary intake. We found that in children aged 4 to 12 years receiving a nutritional intervention plus behavioural management training, consumed about 276 calories per day more than children just receiving the nutritional intervention. We also found that a structured decision‐making tool for adults considering lung transplantation improved their knowledge, assisted in setting realistic expectations, and reduced indecision. In summary, there is some evidence that behavioural interventions targeting specific illness‐related symptoms and behaviours can work. More studies on psychological interventions with more people are urgently needed. There are several ongoing randomised controlled studies aimed at improving adherence to prescribed treatments, but final results are not yet available. We recommend multicentre studies to provide evidence for which interventions are most effective for the key issues faced by people with cystic fibrosis and their caregivers.","6","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adult; Caregivers [*psychology]; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*psychology, therapy]; Diet [psychology]; Family; Family Therapy [methods]; Humans; Patient Compliance [psychology]; Psychotherapy [*methods]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Therapy [psychology]","10.1002/14651858.CD003148.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003148.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD006957","Al Hajeri, A; Serjeant, GR; Fedorowicz, Z","Inhaled nitric oxide for acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2008","Abstract - Background Acute chest syndrome has been defined as a new infiltrate visible on chest radiograph associated with one or more symptoms, such as fever, cough, sputum production, tachypnoea, dyspnoea, or new‐onset hypoxia. Symptoms and complications of this syndrome, whether of infectious or non‐infectious origin, vary quite widely in people with sickle cell disease. Lung infection tends to predominate in children, whilst infarction appears more common in adults. However, these are often interrelated and may occur concurrently. The differences in clinical course and severity are suggestive of multiple causes for acute chest syndrome. Successful treatment depends principally on high‐quality supportive care. The syndrome and its treatment have been extensively studied, but the response to antibiotics, anticoagulants, and other conventional therapies remains disappointing. The potential of inhaled nitric oxide as a treatment option has more recently provoked considerable interest. Nitric oxide appears to play a major role in both the regulation of vascular muscle tone at the cellular level and in platelet aggregation (clumping). Much of the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease is consistent with a mechanism of nitric oxide depletion and although there has been extensive research on the pathophysiology of acute chest syndrome, the possible therapeutic role of inhaled nitric oxide for acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease is still to be determined. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of inhaled nitric oxide for treating acute chest syndrome by comparing improvement in symptoms and clinical outcomes against standard care. Search methods We searched The Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. In July 2007 the following clinical trials registers were searched:  ClinicalTrials.gov ; the  WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ;  Current Controlled Trials ; and  Clinicaltrials.com . Most recent search of the Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 10 September 2010. Selection criteria All randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials of people with sickle cell disease suffering from acute chest syndrome, comparing the use of inhaled nitric oxide to placebo or standard care for any single or multiple treatment and over any time period. Data collection and analysis No studies identified were eligible for inclusion. Main results No studies identified were eligible for inclusion. Authors' conclusions There is a need for well‐designed, adequately‐powered randomised controlled trial to assess the benefits and risks of this form of treatment as an adjunct to established therapies. Plain language summary Inhaled nitric oxide for acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder affecting approximately 250 million people worldwide. Sickle‐shaped red blood cells which are characteristic of sickle cell disease may block blood vessels causing pain, tissue death and even severe damage in the major organs. Similar blockages in the blood vessels of the lungs can lead to lung injury and a complication known as acute chest syndrome which occurs in approximately 30% of people with sickle cell disease. Common symptoms include fever, coughing, chest pain and shortness of breath; some of which can be l i fe‐threatening. Treatment is mainly supportive and given when an individual experiences symptoms and may include antibiotics, drugs to help prevent the clotting of blood and other conventional treatments. Interest has been shown recently in inhaling nitric oxide, a soluble gas. This gas is known to play a role in expanding blood vessels and clumping platelets, to relieve some of the symptoms of acute chest syndrome. It is also used for treatment in similar conditions, namely pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the blood vessels of the lungs) in babies up to four weeks old. The authors of the review did not find any trials showing how effective inhaled nitric oxide is for acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease. The authors concluded that future research should provide evidence for people to make informed decisions about whether nitric oxide is effective.","1","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Administration, Inhalation; Anemia, Sickle Cell [*complications]; Bronchodilator Agents [*administration & dosage]; Humans; Nitric Oxide [*administration & dosage]; Respiration Disorders [*drug therapy, etiology]; Syndrome","10.1002/14651858.CD006957","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006957","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Management of the resulting anaemia is through red blood cell transfusions. Repeated transfusions result in an excessive accumulation of iron in the body (iron overload), removal of which is achieved through iron chelation therapy. Desferrioxamine mesylate (desferrioxamine) is one of the most widely used iron chelators. Substantial data have shown the beneficial effects of desferrioxamine, although adherence to desferrioxamine therapy is a challenge. Alternative oral iron chelators, deferiprone and deferasirox, are now commonly used. Important questions exist about whether desferrioxamine, as monotherapy or in combination with an oral iron chelator, is the best treatment for iron chelation therapy. Objectives To determine the effectiveness (dose and method of administration) of desferrioxamine in people with transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia. To summarise data from trials on the clinical efficacy and safety of desferrioxamine for thalassaemia and to compare these with deferiprone and deferasirox. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register. We also searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL ( The Cochrane Library),  LILACS and other international medical databases, plus ongoing trials registers and the Transfusion Evidence Library (www.transfusionevidencelibrary.com). All searches were updated to 5 March 2013. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing desferrioxamine with placebo, with another iron chelator, or comparing two schedules or doses of desferrioxamine, in people with transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia. Data collection and analysis Six authors working independently were involved in trial quality assessment and data extraction. For one trial, investigators supplied additional data upon request. Main results A total of 22 trials involving 2187 participants (range 11 to 586 people) were included. These trials included eight comparisons between desferrioxamine alone and deferiprone alone; five comparisons between desferrioxamine combined with deferiprone and deferiprone alone; eight comparisons between desferrioxamine alone and desferrioxamine combined with deferiprone; two comparisons of desferrioxamine with deferasirox; and two comparisons of different routes of desferrioxamine administration (bolus versus continuous infusion). Overall, few trials measured the same or long‐term outcomes. Seven trials reported cardiac function or liver fibrosis as measures of end organ damage; none of these included a comparison with deferasirox. Five trials reported a total of seven deaths; three in patients who received desferrioxamine alone, two in patients who received desferrioxamine and deferiprone. A further death occurred in a patient who received deferiprone in another who received deferasirox alone. One trial reported five further deaths in patients who withdrew from randomised treatment (deferiprone with or without desferrioxamine) and switched to desferrioxamine alone. One trial planned five years of follow up but was stopped early due to the beneficial effects of a reduction in serum ferritin levels in those receiving combined desferrioxamine and deferiprone treatment compared with deferiprone alone. The results of this and three other trials suggest an advantage of combined therapy with desferrioxamine and deferiprone over monotherapy to reduce iron stores as measured by serum ferritin. There is, however, no evidence for the improved efficacy of combined desferrioxamine and deferiprone therapy against monotherapy from direct or indirect measures of liver iron. Earlier trials measuring the cardiac iron load indirectly by measurement of the magnetic resonance imaging T2* signal had suggested deferiprone may reduce cardiac iron more quickly than desferrioxamine. However, meta‐analysis of two trials showed a significantly lower left ventricular ejection fraction in patients who received desferrioxamine alone compared with those who received combination therapy using desferrioxamine with deferiprone. Adverse events were recorded by 18 trials. These occurred with all treatments, but were significantly less likely with desferrioxamine than deferiprone in one trial, relative risk 0.45 (95% confidence interval 0.24 to 0.84) and significantly less likely with desferrioxamine alone than desferrioxamine combined with deferiprone in two other trials, relative risk 0.33 (95% confidence interval 0.13 to 0.84). In particular, four studies reported permanent treatment withdrawal due to adverse events from deferiprone; only one of these reported permanent withdrawals associated with desferrioxamine. Adverse events also occurred at a higher frequency in patients who received deferasirox than desferrioxamine in one trial. Eight trials reported local adverse reactions at the site of desferrioxamine infusion including pain and swelling. Adverse events associated with deferiprone included joint pain, gastrointestinal disturbance, increases in liver enzymes and neutropenia; adverse events associated with deferasirox comprised increases in liver enzymes and renal impairment. Regular monitoring of white cell counts has been recommended for deferiprone and monitoring of liver and renal function for deferasirox. In summary, desferrioxamine and the oral iron chelators deferiprone and deferasirox produce significant reductions in iron stores in transfusion‐dependent, iron‐overloaded people. There is no evidence from randomised clinical trials to suggest that any one of these has a greater reduction of clinically significant end organ damage, although in two trials, combination therapy with desferrioxamine and deferiprone showed a greater improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction than desferrioxamine used alone. Authors' conclusions Desferrioxamine is the recommended first‐line therapy for iron overload in people with thalassaemia major and deferiprone or deferasirox are indicated for treating iron overload when desferrioxamine is contraindicated or inadequate. Oral deferasirox has been licensed for use in children aged over six years who receive frequent blood transfusions and in children aged two to five years who receive infrequent blood transfusions. In the absence of randomised controlled trials with long‐term follow up, there is no compelling evidence to change this conclusion. Worsening iron deposition in the myocardium in patients receiving desferrioxamine alone would suggest a change of therapy by intensification of desferrioxamine treatment or the use of desferrioxamine and deferiprone combination therapy. Adverse events are increased in patients treated with deferiprone compared with desferrioxamine and in patients treated with combined deferiprone and desferrioxamine compared with desferrioxamine alone. People treated with all chelators must be kept under close medical supervision and treatment with deferiprone or deferasirox requires regular monitoring of neutrophil counts or renal function respectively. There is an urgent need for adequately‐powered, high‐quality trials comparing the overall clinical efficacy and long‐term outcomes of deferiprone, deferasirox and desferrioxamine. Plain language summary Desferrioxamine mesylate (desferrioxamine) for managing excess iron levels in the blood of people with thalassaemia who depend on blood transfusions Haemoglobin carries oxygen in the blood. In thalassaemia, a genetic disease, sometimes the body cannot produce enough haemoglobin. This can be managed by receiving regular blood transfusions, but may lead to excess iron in the body which must be removed to prevent organ damage. Iron is removed by iron chelation therapy using a substance called an iron chelator. This works by sticking to excess iron molecules in the body. When patients go to the toilet, this excess iron leaves the body. Three iron chelators are commonly used. One (desferrioxamine) is injected and two (deferiprone and deferasirox) are taken orally. Deferasirox is licensed for use in children. Desferrioxamine is inconvenient and expensive; motivating researchers to find safe, effective oral iron chelators. We found 22 randomised controlled trials comparing iron chelators. These do not provide enough information about death or organ damage. However, they showed all three chelators performed similarly well in removing excess iron. Several trials found combining desferrioxamine and deferiprone removed more excess iron than using just one iron chelator. Trials showing side effects must be considered carefully. Side effects with desferrioxamine included pain or skin reactions at the injection site and joint pain. Side effects with deferiprone included joint pain, nausea, stomach upsets and low white blood cell count. Side effects with deferasirox included skin rashes, increases in liver enzymes and reduced kidney function. Low white blood cell count and reduced kidney function are important side effects and in patients receiving deferiprone or deferasirox these should be monitored regularly. Patients were three times more likely to experience a side effect when deferiprone and desferrioxamine were combined, compared with desferrioxamine alone. Three studies showed that patients using deferiprone were two and a half times more likely to have joint pain compared with using desferrioxamine alone. We have found no evidence for changing current treatment recommendations, which state that deferiprone or deferasirox should be used to remove excess iron when desferrioxamine cannot be used or is inadequate. The Food and Drug Administration in the United States of America have approved deferiprone only as ""last resort treatment of iron overload in thalassemia"". Larger randomised control trials of iron chelation therapy are needed, using standardised agreed measures of iron levels and organ damage to allow comparison of such valuable treatments.","8","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Transfusion Reaction; Benzoates [administration & dosage]; Chelation Therapy; Deferasirox; Deferiprone; Deferoxamine [*administration & dosage]; Humans; Iron Chelating Agents [*administration & dosage]; Iron Overload [*drug therapy, etiology]; Pyridones [administration & dosage]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Siderophores [*administration & dosage]; Thalassemia [*therapy]; Triazoles [administration & dosage]","10.1002/14651858.CD004450.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004450.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD010338.PUB3","Ray, S; Ray, A","Non‐surgical interventions for treating heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) in women with bleeding disorders","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2016","Abstract - Background Heavy menstrual bleeding without an organic lesion is mainly due to an imbalance of the various hormones which have a regulatory effect on the menstrual cycle. Another cause of heavy menstrual bleeding with no pelvic pathology, is the presence of an acquired or inherited bleeding disorder. The haemostatic system has a central role in controlling the amount and the duration of menstrual bleeding, thus abnormally prolonged or profuse bleeding does occur in most women affected by bleeding disorders. Whereas irregular, pre‐menarchal or post‐menopausal uterine bleeding is unusual in inherited or acquired haemorrhagic disorders, severe acute bleeding and heavy menstrual bleeding at menarche and chronic heavy menstrual bleeding during the entire reproductive life are common. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives To determine the efficacy and safety of non‐surgical interventions versus each other, placebo or no treatment for reducing menstrual blood loss in women with bleeding disorders. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register (25 August 2016), Embase (May 2013), LILACS (February 2013) and the WHO International Clinical Trial registry (February 2013). Selection criteria Randomised controlled studies of non‐surgical interventions for treating heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) in women of reproductive age suffering from a congenital or acquired bleeding disorder. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Main results Three cross‐over studies, with 175 women were included in the review. All three studies had an unclear risk of bias with regards to trial design and overall, the quality of evidence generated was judged to be poor. Two of the studies (n = 59) compared desmopressin (1‐deamino‐8‐D‐arginine vasopressin) with placebo. Menstrual blood loss was the primary outcome for both of these studies. Neither study found clear evidence of a difference between groups. The first of these reported a mean difference in menstrual blood loss in the desmopressin versus placebo group of 21.20 mL (95% confidence interval ‐19.00 to 61.50) The second study reported that even though there was an improvement of pictorial bleeding assessment chart scores with desmopressin and placebo when compared to pretreatment assessment, there was no clear evidence of difference in these scores when the two were compared to each other (results presented graphically, P = 0.51). The data from these studies could not be combined. The third study (n = 116) compared desmopressin with tranexamic acid (n = 116). This study found a decrease in pictorial bleeding assessment chart scores after both treatments as compared to baseline. The decrease in these scores was greater for tranexamic acid than for desmopressin, with a mean difference of 41.6 mL (95% confidence interval 19.6 to 63) (P < 0.0002). In relation to adverse events, across two studies, there was no clear evidence of a difference when placebo was compared to desmopressin, risk ratio 1.17 (95% confidence interval 0.41 to 3.34) . The same was also true when desmopressin was compared to tranexamic acid, risk ratio 1.17 (95% confidence interval 0.41 to 3.34). Only the study that compared desmopressin to tranexamic acid assessed quality of life. However, we are unable to present any data from this study, since no differences in this outcome between the two intervention groups were reported. Authors' conclusions Evidence from randomised controlled studies on the effect of desmopressin when compared to placebo in reducing menstrual blood loss is very limited and inconclusive. Two studies, each with a very limited number of participants, have shown uncertain effects in menstrual blood loss and adverse effects. A non‐randomised comparison in one of the studies points to the value of combining desmopressin and tranexamic acid, which needs to be tested in a formal randomised controlled study comparison. When tranexamic acid was compared to desmopressin, a single study showed a reduction in menstrual blood loss with tranexamic acid use compared to desmopressin. There is a need to evaluate non‐surgical methods for treating of menorrhagia in women with bleeding disorders through randomised controlled studies. Such methods would be more acceptable than surgery for women wishing to retain their fertility. Given that women may need to use these treatments throughout their entire reproductive life, long‐term side‐effects should be evaluated. Plain language summary Medical therapies for treating heavy menstrual bleeding in women with bleeding disorders Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect and safety of non‐surgical treatments versus each other, placebo or no treatment for reducing menstrual blood loss in women with bleeding disorders. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Background Heavy menstrual bleeding is one of the most common symptoms in women with bleeding disorders. A sizeable population of women with heavy menstrual bleeding are affected by either inherited or acquired bleeding disorders and at the time of presentation these women are considerably younger than the women who suffer from this due to other reasons. Since heavy menstrual bleeding starts at the very onset of menarche and continues throughout reproductive life, the quality of life of these women is severely affected and they are at an increased risk of developing iron‐deficiency anaemia. Search date The evidence is current to: 25 August 2016. Study characteristics The review included three studies on non‐surgical treatments in 175 women with a bleeding disorder who were experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding .  Two s tudies compared desmopressin to placebo and one study compared desmopressin to tranexamic acid. The women included in the studies were selected for one treatment or the other randomly. The studies lasted from two to four months. Key results Two studies of the three studies (with a total of 59 women) found no clear evidence of a difference in desmopressin (1‐deamino‐8‐D‐arginine vasopressin) in reducing menstrual blood loss when compared to placebo. One of these studies continued with an open non‐randomised comparison of a combination of desmopressin with tranexamic acid versus placebo and found a significant reduction in menstrual blood loss. However, the non‐randomised design of this comparison is an additional potential source of bias. The third study (116 women), which had more participants than the other two studies combined, found a greater reduction in menstrual blood loss with tranexamic acid use than with desmopressin. We were unable to present any data on quality of life from this study, since no differences in between the two intervention groups were reported. There was no clear evidence of difference in the risk of side effects with desmopressin as compared to tranexamic acid. None of the studies dealt with cost effectiveness. Quality of the evidence We were not able to adequately assess the studies in relation to how the women were allocated to the treatment groups and we judged the overall quality of the evidence as poor.","11","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adult; Blood Coagulation Disorders [complications, *drug therapy]; Deamino Arginine Vasopressin [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Female; Hemostatics [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Humans; Menorrhagia [*drug therapy, etiology]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Tranexamic Acid [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]","10.1002/14651858.CD010338.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010338.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

It is unique among the ultra‐orphan disorders in that four treatments are currently approved by various regulatory authorities for use in routine clinical practice. Hitherto, because of the relatively few people affected worldwide, many of whom started therapy during a prolonged period when there were essentially no alternatives to imiglucerase, these treatments have not been systematically evaluated in studies such as randomized controlled trials now considered necessary to generate the highest level of clinical evidence. Objectives To summarize all available randomized controlled study data on the efficacy and safety of enzyme replacement therapies and substrate reduction therapy for treating Gaucher disease. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register. Additional searches were conducted on ClinicalTrials.gov for any ongoing studies with potential interim results, and through PubMed. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 07 August 2014. Selection criteria All randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled studies (including open‐label studies and cross‐over studies) assessing enzyme replacement therapy or substrate reduction therapy, or both, in all types of Gaucher disease were included. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias in the included studies, and extracted relevant data. Main results Of the 488 studies retrieved by the electronic searches, eight met the inclusion criteria and were analysed (300 participants). Response parameters were restricted to haemoglobin concentration, platelet count, spleen and liver volume and serum biomarkers (chitotriosidase and CCL18). Only one publication reported a 'low risk of bias' score in all parameters assessed, and all studies included were randomized. Four studies reported the responses to enzyme replacement therapy of previously untreated individuals with type 1 Gaucher disease. Two studies investigated maintenance enzyme replacement therapy in people with stable type 1 Gaucher disease previously treated for at least two years. One study compared substrate reduction therapy, enzyme replacement therapy and a combination thereof as maintenance therapy in people with type 1 Gaucher disease previously treated with enzyme replacement therapy. One study examined substrate reduction therapy in people with chronic neuronopathic (type 3) Gaucher disease who continued to receive enzyme replacement therapy. Treatment‐naïve participants had similar increases in haemoglobin when comparing those receiving imiglucerase or alglucerase at 60 units/kg, imiglucerase or velaglucerase alfa at 60 U/kg, taliglucerase alfa at 30 units/kg or 60 units/kg, and velaglucerase alfa at 45 units/g or 60 units/kg. For platelet count response in participants with intact spleens, a benefit for imiglucerase over velaglucerase alfa at 60 units/kg was observed, mean difference ‐79.87 (95% confidence interval ‐137.57 to ‐22.17). There were no other significant differences in platelet count response when comparing different doses of velaglucerase alfa and of taliglucerase alfa, and when comparing imiglucerase to alglucerase. Spleen and liver volume reductions were not significantly different in any enzyme replacement therapy product or dose comparison study. Although a dose effect on serum biomarkers was not seen after nine months, a significantly greater reduction with higher dose was reported after 12 months in the velaglucerase study, mean difference 16.70 (95% confidence intervaI 1.51 to 31.89). In the two enzyme replacement therapy maintenance studies comparing infusions every two weeks and every four weeks, there were no significant differences in haemoglobin concentration, platelet count, and spleen and liver volumes over a 6 to 12 month period when participants were treated with the same cumulative dose. A total of 25 serious adverse events were reported, nearly all deemed unrelated to treatment. There are, as yet, no randomized trials of substrate reduction therapy in treatment‐naïve patients that can be evaluated. Miglustat monotherapy appeared as effective as continued enzyme replacement therapy for maintenance of hematological, organ and biomarker responses in people with type 1 Gaucher disease previously treated with imiglucerase for at least two years. In those with neuronopathic Gaucher disease, no significant improvements in haemoglobin concentration, platelet count or organ volumes occurred when enzyme replacement therapy was augmented with miglustat. One randomized controlled study assessing substrate reduction therapy was published immediately prior to producing the final version of this review, and this, along with a further ongoing study (expected to be published in the near future), will be assessed for eligibility in a future update of the review. Authors' conclusions The results reflect the limitations of analysing evidence restricted to prospective randomized controlled trials, especially when dealing with chronic rare diseases. This analysis suggests that, during the first year of treatment, different recombinant glucocerebrosidases are bio‐similar and non‐inferior in safety and efficacy for surrogate biological response parameters. Enzyme replacement therapy given at 30 to 45 units/kg body weight every two to four weeks was generally as effective as the 60 unit/kg dose for the assessed clinical outcomes. The analysis emphasise the need to determine whether it is realistic to carry out multi‐decade prospective clinical trials for rare diseases such as type 1 Gaucher disease. With large treatment effects on the classical manifestations of the disorder, therapeutic investigations in Gaucher disease mandate innovative trial designs and methodology to secure decisive data concerning long‐term efficacy and safety – with the realization that knowledge about disease‐modifying actions that are sustained are of crucial importance to people with this chronic condition. Plain language summary Treatment options for Gaucher disease Gaucher disease, a rare disorder, is caused by inherited deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. This defect leads to the build‐up of a fatty material called glucocerebroside in various cells in the body. Untreated individuals may suffer from anaemia, a decrease in platelet counts, massive enlargement of the liver and spleen, and damage to the bones. Two different types of treatment are available: the intravenous supplementation of the deficient protein glucocerebrosidase (enzyme replacement therapy), or the oral administration of a drug that slows down the production of the fatty material that it normally breaks down (substrate reduction therapy). Although there are many published studies about treatment of Gaucher disease, those that are based on randomized controlled clinical studies are considered to provide the strongest evidence. Eight such studies (300 participants) were identified by systematically reviewing the medical literature. Potential risks of bias in the methods employed in the original studies and in the data reported were assessed; only one study scored 'low' in all bias domains. Six evaluated the possible beneficial effects on the disease by enzyme replacement therapy using different products, doses or frequencies of administration; two studies examined the effects of substrate reduction therapy. Owing to different study methods and data formats, the original results could not be pooled or combined in order to obtain summary measures of efficacy. Our analysis, despite being limited by the small number of studies, suggests that, at least during the first year of treatment, different enzyme replacement therapy drugs appear to have a similar safety profile and all improve some of the most obvious manifestations of the disease. One randomized controlled study assessing substrate reduction therapy was published immediately prior to producing the final version of this review, and this, along with a further ongoing study (expected to be published in the near future), will be assessed for eligibility in a future update of the review.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","1‐Deoxynojirimycin [adverse effects, analogs & derivatives]; Enzyme Inhibitors [adverse effects]; Enzyme Replacement Therapy [*methods]; Gaucher Disease [blood, *drug therapy]; Glucosylceramidase [therapeutic use]; Hemoglobin A [metabolism]; Hepatomegaly [drug therapy]; Humans; Platelet Count; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Splenomegaly [drug therapy]; Substrate Specificity","10.1002/14651858.CD010324.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010324.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Annual influenza vaccination is therefore commonly recommended for people with cystic fibrosis. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of influenza vaccination for people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.

Selection criteria All randomised and quasi‐randomised trials (published or unpublished) comparing any influenza vaccine with a placebo or with another type of influenza vaccine. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Additional information was obtained by contacting the investigators when it was indicated. Main results Four studies enrolling a total of 179 participants with cystic fibrosis (143 (80%) were children aged 1 to 16 years) were included in this review. There was no study comparing a vaccine to a placebo or a whole virus vaccine to a subunit or split virus vaccine. Two studies compared an intranasal applied live vaccine to an intramuscular inactivated vaccine and the other two studies compared a split virus to a subunit vaccine and a virosome to a subunit vaccine (all intramuscular). The incidence of all reported adverse events was high depending on the type of influenza vaccine. The total adverse event rate ranged from 48 out of 201 participants (24%) for the intranasal live vaccine to 13 out of 30 participants (43%) for the split virus vaccine. With the limitation of a statistical low power there was no significant difference between the study vaccinations. None of the events were severe. All study influenza vaccinations generated a satisfactory serological antibody response. No study reported other clinically important benefits. Authors' conclusions There is currently no evidence from randomised studies that influenza vaccine given to people with cystic fibrosis is of benefit to them. There remains a need for a well‐constructed clinical study, that assesses the effectiveness of influenza vaccination on important clinical outcome measures. Plain language summary Vaccines for preventing influenza in people with cystic fibrosis People with cystic fibrosis have blocked airways which results in frequent airway infections. Infections with viral diseases like influenza (""the flu"") can worsen lung damage. Doctors therefore often advise people with cystic fibrosis to be vaccinated against influenza every year. We searched for studies which compared different vaccines or compared vaccination to placebo. We were able to include four studies with 179 people in the review. Most (143) were under 16 years old. No study compared one vaccine to placebo. There were a high number of drop outs in two of the studies. Vaccination does result in an immune system response to the types of influenza used in the vaccine. However, this response may not result in protection against influenza infection or lung damage. There were a high number of adverse events, but none were serious or persistent. There is no evidence to show if regular influenza vaccine benefits people with cystic fibrosis.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Influenza Vaccines [administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Humans; Infant; Influenza, Human [*prevention & control]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Vaccines, Attenuated [administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Vaccines, Inactivated [administration & dosage, adverse effects]","10.1002/14651858.CD001753.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001753.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Objectives To test the hypotheses that, in people with cystic fibrosis, macrolide antibiotics:   1. improve clinical status compared to placebo or another antibiotic;   2. do not have unacceptable adverse effects.   If benefit was demonstrated, we aimed to assess the optimal type, dose and duration of macrolide therapy. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We contacted investigators known to work in the field, previous authors and pharmaceutical companies manufacturing macrolide antibiotics for unpublished or follow‐up data (May 2010). Latest search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 29 February 2012. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of macrolide antibiotics compared to: placebo; another class of antibiotic; another macrolide antibiotic; or the same macrolide antibiotic at a different dose. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Seven groups were contacted and provided additional data which were incorporated into the review. Main results Ten of 31 studies identified were included (959 patients). Five studies with a low risk of bias examined azithromycin versus placebo and demonstrated consistent improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second over six months (mean difference at six months 3.97% (95% confidence interval 1.74% to 6.19%; n = 549, from four studies)). Patients treated with azithromycin were approximately twice as likely to be free of pulmonary exacerbation at six months, odds ratio 1.96 (95% confidence interval 1.15 to 3.33). With respect to secondary outcomes, there was a significant reduction in need for oral antibiotics and greater weight gain in those taking azithromycin. Adverse events were uncommon and not obviously associated with azithromycin, although a once‐weekly high dose regimen was associated with more frequent gastrointestinal adverse events. Treatment with azithromycin was associated with reduced identification of  Staphylococcus aureus  on respiratory culture, but also a significant increase in macrolide resistance. Authors' conclusions This review provides evidence of improved respiratory function after six months of azithromycin. Data beyond six months were less clear, although reduction in pulmonary exacerbation was sustained. Treatment appeared safe over a six‐month period; however, emergence of macrolide resistance was a concern. A multi‐centre trial examining long‐term effects of this antibiotic treatment is needed, especially for infants recognised through newborn screening. Plain language summary Treatment with macrolide antibiotics for people with cystic fibrosis and chronic chest infection People with cystic fibrosis suffer from chest infections, often caused by the bacteria  Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  This bacteria is resistant to nearly all antibiotics that can be taken by mouth. Macrolide antibiotics, e.g. azithromycin, have no direct killing effect on  Pseudomonas aeruginosa , but they may reduce the activity of these bacteria. We have included ten randomised controlled trials with a total of 959 participants in this review. Eight of these trials compared azithromycin (a macrolide antibiotic) to placebo and two compared different doses of azithromycin. Four trials in children and adults (549 participants) showed significant improvements in lung function after treatment with azithromycin compared to placebo at six months; although data from later time points are not so clear. Patients treated with azithromycin were about twice as likely to be free of pulmonary exacerbation; needed fewer oral antibiotics and had fewer instances of  Staphylococcus aureus  in cultures from their lungs and airways. Adverse events were not common and not obviously associated with azithromycin, although there was an increase in resistance to macrolides. Most studies used a three times a week dosing schedule. Taking a high weekly dose was linked to an increase in mild gastrointestinal adverse events. Further multicentre studies are needed to look at the long‐term effects of this antibiotic treatment, especially for infants diagnosed through newborn screening.","11","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Anti‐Bacterial Agents [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Azithromycin [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Bacterial Infections [drug therapy, etiology]; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Disease Progression; Humans; Macrolides [adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Pseudomonas Infections [*drug therapy]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD002203.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002203.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Once colonisation of the lungs with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  occurs, it is almost impossible to eradicate. Vaccines, aimed at reducing infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa , have been developed. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of vaccination against  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register using the terms vaccines AND pseudomonas (last search 30 March 2015). We previously searched PubMed using the terms vaccin* AND cystic fibrosis (last search 30 May 2013). Selection criteria Randomised trials (published or unpublished) comparing  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  vaccines (oral, parenteral or intranasal) with control vaccines or no intervention in cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis The authors independently selected trials, assessed them and extracted data. Main results Six trials were identified. Two trials were excluded since they were not randomised and one old, small trial because it was not possible to assess whether is was randomised. The three included trials comprised 483, 476 and 37 patients, respectively. No data have been published from one of the large trials, but the company stated in a press release that the trial failed to confirm the results from an earlier study and that further clinical development was suspended. In the other large trial, relative risk for chronic infection was 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.55 to 1.49), and in the small trial, the risk was also close to one. In the large trial, one patient was reported to have died in the observation period. In that trial, 227 adverse events (4 severe) were registered in the vaccine group and 91 (1 severe) in the control group. In this large trial of a vaccine developed against flagella antigens, antibody titres against the epitopes contained in the vaccine were higher in the vaccine group compared to the placebo group (P < 0.0001). Authors' conclusions Vaccines against  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  cannot be recommended. Plain language summary Vaccines for preventing infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of vaccinating people with cystic fibrosis to prevent infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Background Cystic fibrosis is a hereditary disease where thick mucus is produced in the lungs. This can stop the lungs clearing bacteria such as  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  and other bacteria. This causes long‐lasting lung infections in approximately 80% of adult patients; these infections result in permanent lung damage. Vaccines have been developed which aim to reduce infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  and it is important to know whether using these vaccines can prevent lung infection. Search date The evidence is current to: 30 March 2015. Study characteristics We searched for vaccine trials where cystic fibrosis patients were selected at random to receive either an active vaccine or no vaccine (or a placebo, which is a dummy vaccine with no active medication). We also looked for trials comparing different types of vaccine or different schedules or doses of the same vaccine. We included three trials; two compared a  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  vaccine to a placebo and the third compared a vaccine to no vaccine. The two trials comparing a vaccine to placebo had 959 cystic fibrosis patients (483 in one and 476 in the other); the third trial recruited 37 patients with cystic fibrosis. The average age of the patients was about seven years in all three trials. All of the patients were free of infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  at the start of the trials and had a lung function of at least 50% of predicted for age. The two large trials followed the patients for two and four years, respectively; the small trial followed the patients for between 10 and 12 years. Key results We were only able to present the results from one of the large trials (483 cystic fibrosis patients) comparing an active vaccine to a placebo and the small trial (37 cystic fibrosis patients) with a no vaccination comparison group. Results for the second large trial have not been published, but the manufacturers stated that results did not confirm the findings from an earlier trial and that further clinical development had been suspended. The results we have from the two trials show that after vaccination the risk of getting a chronic infection did not decrease and lung function was similar in both groups of cystic fibrosis patients. One of the patients from the large trial died during the two year follow‐up period; in the small trial, one patient from each group had died after seven to eight years and by the end of the trial (10 to 12 years) six patients in each group had died. Those who died were all chronically infected with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Investigators in the large trial, recorded 227 adverse events (four of which were classed as severe) in the vaccine group and 91 (one of which was classed as severe) in the placebo group. The large trial also reported a rise in antibodies against  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  with no change in the placebo group. On the basis of these results, we cannot recommend the use of vaccines against  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in patients with cystic fibrosis. Quality of the evidence We did have some concerns that in the large trial which provided data for this review, the participants in the vaccine group were apparently older, taller and heavier than those in the placebo group. This may be due to pure chance, but the paper did not acknowledge this fact. We also had some concerns about how the cystic fibrosis patients in the small trial were randomised to the different treatments.","8","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Cystic Fibrosis [*complications, microbiology]; Humans; Pseudomonas Infections [complications, *prevention & control]; Pseudomonas Vaccines [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Pseudomonas aeruginosa [immunology]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD001399.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001399.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD003884.PUB4","Elphick, HE; Mallory, G","Oxygen therapy for cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2013","Abstract - Background The most serious complications of cystic fibrosis (CF) relate to respiratory insufficiency. Oxygen supplementation therapy has long been a standard of care for individuals with chronic lung diseases associated with hypoxemia. Physicians commonly prescribe oxygen therapy for people with CF when hypoxemia occurs. However, it is unclear if empiric evidence is available to provide indications for this therapy with its financial costs and often profound impact on lifestyle. Objectives To assess whether oxygen therapy improves the longevity or quality of life of individuals with CF. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Latest search of Group's Trials Register: 15 May 2013. Selection criteria Randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled trials comparing oxygen, administered at any concentration, by any route, in people with documented CF for any time period. Data collection and analysis Authors independently assessed the risk of bias for included studies and extracted data. Main results This review includes 11 published studies (172 participants); only one examined long‐term oxygen therapy (28 participants). There was no statistically significant improvement in survival, lung, or cardiac health. There was an improvement in regular attendance at school or work in those receiving oxygen therapy at 6 and 12 months. Four studies examined the effect of oxygen supplementation during sleep by polysomnography. Although oxygenation improved, mild hypercapnia was noted. Participants fell asleep quicker and spent a reduced percentage of total sleep time in rapid eye movement sleep, but there were no demonstrable improvements in qualitative sleep parameters. Six studies evaluated oxygen supplementation during exercise. Again, oxygenation improved, but mild hypercapnia resulted. Participants receiving oxygen therapy were able to exercise for a significantly longer duration during exercise. Other exercise parameters were not altered by the use of oxygen. Authors' conclusions There are no published data to guide the prescription of chronic oxygen supplementation to people with advanced lung disease due to CF. Short‐term oxygen therapy during sleep and exercise improves oxygenation but is associated with modest and probably clinically inconsequential hypercapnia. There are improvements in exercise duration, time to fall asleep and regular attendance at school or work. There is a need for larger, well‐designed clinical trials to assess the benefits of long‐term oxygen therapy in people with CF administered continuously or during exercise or sleep or both. However, we do not expect any new research to be undertaken in this area any time soon and do not plan to update this review again until any new evidence does become available. Plain language summary Additional oxygen in the treatment of cystic fibrosis People with cystic fibrosis (CF) suffer from breathing problems. Giving additional oxygen has long been a standard of care for people with chronic lung diseases. It is common for doctors to prescribe this treatment for people with CF when there is not enough oxygen in their blood. We looked for evidence that this treatment improves the length and quality of life for people with CF. We found eleven studies with 172 participants to include in the review. All studies compared low‐flow oxygen to room air. Ten of the studies were short‐term. Four of the studies looked at giving additional oxygen at night. At night, oxygen levels rose during both rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non‐REM sleep in those people breathing low‐flow oxygen. Participants breathing oxygen at night also spent less time in REM sleep and took less time to fall asleep. Six of the studies looked at the effect of extra oxygen on exercise. The levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood of participants increased during or after exercise when they breathed in low‐flow oxygen. People were able to exercise for longer if they breathed in low‐flow oxygen. There was more regular attendance at school or work in those receiving long‐term oxygen. There is little evidence to support or oppose the long‐term use of oxygen therapy in people with advanced CF lung disease. In the short term, treatment has shown some improvement in blood oxygen levels in people with CF during sleep and exercise. This increase in oxygen also came with an increase in carbon dioxide levels, which is probably not clinically important. However, caution needs to be exercised in those with advanced lung disease where this may require further monitoring. There should be research into the effects of long‐term oxygen treatment on sleep quality and exercise in people with CF. Unfortunately, we do not expect that any such research will be undertaken any time soon, so we do not plan to update this review again until we find any new trials.","7","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Oxygen Inhalation Therapy [adverse effects]; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications, mortality]; Exercise Tolerance; Humans; Hypercapnia [etiology]; Hypoxia [etiology, mortality, *therapy]; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Sleep","10.1002/14651858.CD003884.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003884.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Two distinct types of arthritis are described in cystic fibrosis: cystic fibrosis‐related arthropathy (CFA) and hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPO). Management of arthritis in people with cystic fibrosis is uncertain and complex because of the underlying disease and its intense treatment. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To review the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological agents for the symptomatic management of cystic fibrosis‐related arthritis in adults and children with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of most recent search: 19 January 2016. Selection criteria Randomised controlled studies which compared the efficacy and safety of anti‐inflammatory and analgesic agents (e.g. non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory agents, systemic corticosteroids, intra‐articular corticosteroids) with each other, with no treatment or with placebo for CFA and HPO. Data collection and analysis No relevant studies were identified. Main results No studies were included in this review. Authors' conclusions Although it is generally recognised that CFA may be episodic and resolve spontaneously, treatment with analgesics and anti‐inflammatory agents may be needed. While this approach may be sufficient to manage symptoms, it is disappointing that no randomised controlled trials to rigorously evaluate these agents were found, nor could the authors identify any quasi‐randomised. This systematic review has identified the need for a well‐designed adequately‐powered randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological agents for the symptomatic management of cystic fibrosis‐related arthritis (CFA and HPO) in adults and children with cystic fibrosis. Studies should also better define the two conditions. A study has recently been conducted in CFA and may help fill this gap when analysed and published. There are no trials included in the review up to January 2016. We will continue to run searches to identify any potentially relevant studies; however, we do not plan to update other sections of the review until new studies are published. Plain language summary The use of drugs to manage symptoms in people with arthritis related to cystic fibrosis Arthritis is not a common complication of cystic fibrosis, but it can be a major complication when it does occur. There are two distinct types of arthritis in cystic fibrosis: cystic fibrosis‐related arthropathy and hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy. The best treatment for these conditions is not clear because of the underlying disease and its intense treatment. We planned to report evidence from clinical studies to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different anti‐inflammatory analgesic drugs compared with placebo, with each other or with no treatment. However, we were disappointed that we could not find any completed randomised controlled studies of these treatments or any evidence from non‐randomised controlled studies. One study in cystic fibrosis‐related arthropathy has finished and may provide some evidence when published. We suggest that there should be a randomised controlled study to look at the effects and the safety of using anti‐inflammatory drugs or painkillers or both to manage the symptoms of cystic fibrosis‐related arthritis. This is an update of a previously published review (date of last search 19 January 2016). Since no studies have been included in the review up until January 2016, we will still search for studies every two years, but will not publish an updated version of this review until we can include any new studies.","1","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adult; Analgesics [*therapeutic use]; Anti-Inflammatory Agents [*therapeutic use]; Arthritis [*drug therapy, etiology]; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Humans","10.1002/14651858.CD006838.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006838.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

The Group's Trials Register last searched: June 2008. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials, published and unpublished, comparing screening to clinical diagnosis in people with CF. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality and independently extracted data. Allocation concealment was unclear in both studies and sequence generation adequate in one. Main results Searches identified six trials. Two trials involving 1,124,483 neonates (210 with CF) with a maximum follow up of 17 years were eligible for inclusion. Varying study designs, outcomes reported and summary measures precluded calculation of pooled estimates and only data from one study were analysed. Severe malnutrition was less common among screened participants. Compared with screened participants, the odds ratio of weight below the tenth percentile was 4.12 (95% CI 1.64 to 10.38) and for height was 4.62 (95% CI 1.69 to 12.61) in the control group. At age seven, 88% of screened participants and 75% of controls had lung function parameters within normal limits of at least 89% predicted. At diagnosis chest radiograph scores were significantly better among screened participants; 33% of screened versus 50% of control participants had Wisconsin chest X‐ray (WCXR) scores over five (P = 0.097) and 24% of screened versus 45% of control participants had Brasfield chest X‐ray (BCXR) scores under 21 (P = 0.042)). Over time, chest radiograph scores were worse in the screened group (WCXR P = 0.017 and BCXR P = 0.041). Results were no longer significant after adjustment for genotype, pancreatic status, and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa ‐culture results. In screened participants colonisation with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  occurred earlier. Estimates suggest diagnosis through screening is less expensive. Authors' conclusions Two randomised controlled trials assessing neonatal screening in CF were identified; data from one study were included. Nutritional benefits are apparent. Screening provides potential for better pulmonary outcomes, but confounding factors influenced long‐term pulmonary prognosis of people with CF. Screening seems less expensive than traditional diagnosis.

These complications are suited to early treatment. Newborn screening may therefore improve outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis. We aimed to find out whether newborn screening prevents or reduces organ damage and improves clinical outcomes in people with CF without unacceptable adverse effects. This review includes two trials with 1,124,483 babies (210 with cystic fibrosis). The trials compared newborn screening to clinical diagnosis. We were only able to analyse data from one of the trials. This trial showed that severe malnutrition was less common among screened babies. Screened babies had better chest radiograph scores at diagnosis, but these scores became worse over time. The screened babies become colonised with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  earlier. Costs for screening were less than costs for traditional diagnosis.","1","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Neonatal Screening; Cystic Fibrosis [*diagnosis]; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Survival Analysis","10.1002/14651858.CD001402.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001402.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Background Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease which causes mucus in the lungs to be more sticky than normal, leading to frequent lung infections and lung damage. Pneumococcus is a type of bacteria that can cause infection throughout the body. These infections can be very serious and may lead to severe illness and death. There are two types of vaccine that can help protect people against some forms of pneumococcus bacteria. One vaccine is used in children under two years of age and the second is used in older children and adults. This review aimed to find trials that compared vaccinations (either vaccine) to no vaccination or a vaccination with a placebo (dummy drug) to work out whether vaccinating against pneumococcus bacteria can reduce serious illness and death in people with cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published review. Search date Evidence is current to 27 June 2016. Study characteristics We did not find any relevant trials to include in this review.

The glycosaminoglycans accumulate within tissues affecting multiple organs and physiologic systems. The clinical manifestations include neurologic involvement, severe airways obstruction, skeletal deformities and cardiomyopathy. The disease has a variable age of onset and variable rate of progression. In those with severe disease, death usually occurs in the second decade of life, whereas those individuals with less severe disease may survive into adulthood. Enzyme replacement therapy with intravenous infusions of idursulfase has emerged as a new treatment for mucopolysaccharidosis type II. This is an update of a previously published version of this review. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of enzyme replacement therapy with idursulfase compared to other interventions, placebo or no intervention, for treating mucopolysaccharidosis type II. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register (date of last search 23 November 2015). We also searched Embase, PubMed and the Literature Latino‐Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde (LILACS) (date of last search 28 November 2015). Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials of enzyme replacement therapy with idursulfase compared to no intervention, placebo or other options (e.g. behavioral strategies, transplantation). Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened the trials identified, appraised quality of papers and extracted data. Main results One study (96 male participants) met the inclusion criteria, although the primary outcome of this review ‐ z score for height and weight, was not assessed in the study. This trial was considered to be of overall good quality. Following 53 weeks of treatment, participants in the weekly idursulfase 0.5 mg/kg group demonstrated a significant improvement rate compared with placebo for the primary outcome: distance walked in six minutes on the basis of the sum of ranks of change from baseline, mean difference 37.00 (95% confidence interval 6.52 to 67.48). The every‐other‐week idursulfase 0.5 mg/kg group also showed an improvement, which was not significant compared with placebo, mean difference 23.00 (95% confidence interval ‐4.49 to 50.49). After 53 weeks, there was no statistical significance difference in per cent predicted forced vital capacity between the three groups and absolute forced vital capacity was significantly increased from baseline in the weekly dosing group compared to placebo, mean difference 0.16 (95% confidence interval CI 0.05 to 0.27). No difference was observed between the every‐other‐week idursulfase 0.5 mg/kg group and placebo. In addition, liver and spleen volumes and urine glycosaminoglycan excretion were significantly reduced from baseline by both idursulfase dosing regimens. Idursulfase was generally well tolerated, but infusion reactions did occur. Idursulfase antibodies were detected in 31.7% of participants at the end of the study and they were related to a smaller reduction in urine glycosaminoglycan levels. Authors' conclusions The current evidence is limited. While the randomised clinical trial identified was considered to be of good quality, it failed to describe important outcomes. It has been demonstrated that enzyme replacement therapy with idursulfase is effective in relation to functional capacity (distance walked in six minutes and forced vital capacity), liver and spleen volumes and urine glycosaminoglycan excretion in people with mucopolysaccharidosis type II compared with placebo. There is no available evidence in the included study and in the literature on outcomes such as improvement in growth, sleep apnoea, cardiac function, quality of life and mortality. More studies are needed to obtain more information on the long‐term effectiveness and safety of enzyme replacement therapy. Plain language summary Enzyme replacement therapy with idursulfase for mucopolysaccharidosis type II (Hunter syndrome) Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect and safety of enzyme replacement therapy with idursulfase compared to other interventions, placebo ('dummy treatment') or no intervention, for treating people with mucopolysaccharidosis type II. This is an update of a previously published version of this review. Background Hunter syndrome or mucopolysaccharidosis II is a rare genetic disease that occurs when an enzyme that the body needs is either missing or malfunctioning. The body doesn't have adequate supplies of this enzyme to break down certain complex molecules, so these molecules build up in harmful amounts in certain cells and tissues. The build‐up that occurs in Hunter syndrome eventually causes permanent, progressive damage affecting appearance, mental development, organ function and physical abilities. Hunter syndrome appears in children as young as the age of two years and it nearly always occurs in males. In the past, treatment of Hunter syndrome has been limited to the relief of symptoms and complications. Enzyme replacement therapy with idursulfase aims to replace iduronate‐2‐sulfatase, the enzyme that is deficient or absent in people with Hunter syndrome. However, given its high cost it is essential to assess how effective and safe this treatment is. Search date The evidence is current to: 23 November 2015. Study characteristics The review included one study with 96 males with Hunter syndrome aged between 4.9 and 30.9 years of age. The trial compared idursulfase 0.5 mg/kg given either weekly or every‐other week, or weekly infusions of placebo (a substance which contains no medication) and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly. The study lasted 53 weeks. Key results Current evidence is limited given there was only one randomised clinical trial found in the medical literature. As compared with placebo, enzyme replacement therapy with idursulfase in people with Hunter syndrome, led to some improvement in the individuals' ability to walk and a reduction in the excretion of abnormal mucopolysaccharides in the urine. To date there is no evidence available in the literature showing that treatment reduces complications of the disease related to quality of life and mortality. Quality of the evidence This trial was considered to be of overall good quality.","2","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Drug Administration Schedule; Enzyme Replacement Therapy [*methods]; Humans; Iduronate Sulfatase [*administration & dosage]; Male; Mucopolysaccharidosis II [*drug therapy]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Rare Diseases [*drug therapy, enzymology]","10.1002/14651858.CD008185.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008185.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD009730.PUB2","Hurley, MN; Prayle, AP; Flume, P","Intravenous antibiotics for pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2015","Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis is a multi‐system disease characterised by the production of thick secretions causing recurrent pulmonary infection, often with unusual bacteria. Intravenous antibiotics are commonly used in the treatment of acute deteriorations in symptoms (pulmonary exacerbations); however, recently the assumption that exacerbations are due to increases in bacterial burden has been questioned. Objectives To establish if intravenous antibiotics for the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis improve short‐ and long‐term clinical outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews and ongoing trials registers. Date of last search of Cochrane trials register: 27 July 2015. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials and the first treatment cycle of cross‐over studies comparing intravenous antibiotics (given alone or in an antibiotic combination) with placebo, inhaled or oral antibiotics for people with cystic fibrosis experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation. Data collection and analysis The authors assessed studies for eligibility and risk of bias and extracted data. Main results We included 40 studies involving 1717 participants. The quality of the included studies was largely poor and, with a few exceptions, these comprised of mainly small, inadequately reported studies. When comparing treatment with a single antibiotic to a combined antibiotic regimen, those participants receiving a combination of antibiotics experienced a greater improvement in lung function when considered as a whole group across a number of different measurements of lung function, but with very low quality evidence. When limited to the four placebo‐controlled studies (n = 214), no difference was observed, again with very low quality evidence. With regard to the review's remaining primary outcomes, there was no effect upon time to next exacerbation and no studies in any comparison reported on quality of life. There were no effects on the secondary outcomes weight or adverse effects. When comparing specific antibiotic combinations there were no significant differences between groups on any measure. In the comparisons between intravenous and nebulised antibiotic or oral antibiotic (low quality evidence), there were no significant differences between groups on any measure. No studies in any comparison reported on quality of life. Authors' conclusions The quality of evidence comparing intravenous antibiotics with placebo is poor. No specific antibiotic combination can be considered to be superior to any other, and neither is there evidence showing that the intravenous route is superior to the inhaled or oral routes. There remains a need to understand host‐bacteria interactions and in particular to understand why many people fail to fully respond to treatment. Plain language summary The use of intravenous antibiotics to treat pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis Review question Do intravenous antibiotics (antibiotics given via a vein) given to treat 'flare ups' of lung disease (pulmonary exacerbations) in people with cystic fibrosis improve clinical outcomes in the short term and the long term? Background We wanted to evaluate the evidence for the current practice of using intravenous antibiotics to treat people with cystic fibrosis who have a pulmonary exacerbation. We wanted to discover if it is better to give two antibiotics than just a single antibiotic and wanted to consider if any particular antibiotic combination is better than any other. We also wanted to discover if intravenous antibiotics are any better than inhaled or oral antibiotics in treating pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis. Search date We last searched for evidence on 27 July 2015. Study characteristics The review included 40 studies with 1717 people with cystic fibrosis .  Studies compared intravenous antibiotics with placebo (dummy drug with no active medication) and also one antibiotic compared to two antibiotics given together. Specific antibiotic combinations were also compared as were intravenous antibiotics with antibiotics that were breathed in (inhaled) and antibiotics that were swallowed (oral). The studies lasted from three to 15 days, although most of the studies lasted for two weeks. Key results In the comparison between those people who were given just one antibiotic and those who were given two, it appeared that those receiving two antibiotics experienced a greater improvement in lung function, but when limited to only those studies that included a dummy drug, we did not see any difference. There was no effect upon the amount of time until the next exacerbation, weight, or adverse effects. No combination of antibiotics was any better than any other. The outcomes for people were the same irrespective of whether they were treated by intravenous, oral or inhaled antibiotics. None of the studies reported on quality of life. Quality of the evidence The quality of the included studies was often poor and many were not properly reported. Some studies included volunteers more than once which made comparing treatments difficult. It was also often difficult to decide from the information given how well the studies were carried out ‐ particularly with respect to how volunteers were chosen and whether the volunteers or doctors could tell which treatment they were being given.","7","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adolescent; Adult; Anti‐Bacterial Agents [*administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*drug therapy, physiopathology]; Disease Progression; Humans; Injections, Intravenous; Total Lung Capacity [physiology]","10.1002/14651858.CD009730.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009730.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Antibiotics for pulmonary exacerbations are usually given intravenously, and for long‐term treatment, via a nebuliser. Oral anti‐pseudomonal antibiotics with the same efficacy and safety as intravenous or nebulised antibiotics would benefit people with cystic fibrosis due to ease of treatment and avoidance of hospitalisation. This is an update of a previous review. Objectives To determine the benefit or harm of oral anti‐pseudomonal antibiotic therapy for people with cystic fibrosis, colonised with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa,  in the:  1. treatment of a pulmonary exacerbation; and  2. long‐term treatment of chronic infection. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We contacted pharmaceutical companies and checked reference lists of identified trials. Date of last search: 08 July 2016. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing any dose of oral anti‐pseudomonal antibiotics, to other combinations of inhaled, oral or intravenous antibiotics, or to placebo or usual treatment for pulmonary exacerbations and long‐term treatment. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected the trials, extracted data and assessed quality. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing information. Main results We included three trials examining pulmonary exacerbations (171 participants) and two trials examining long‐term therapy (85 participants). We regarded the most important outcomes as quality of life and lung function. The analysis did not identify any statistically significant difference between oral anti‐pseudomonal antibiotics and other treatments for these outcome measures for either pulmonary exacerbations or long‐term treatment. One of the included trials reported significantly better lung function when treating a pulmonary exacerbation with ciprofloxacin when compared with intravenous treatment; however, our analysis did not confirm this finding. We found no evidence of difference between oral anti‐pseudomonal antibiotics and other treatments regarding adverse events or development of antibiotic resistance, but trials were not adequately powered to detect this. None of the studies had a low risk of bias from blinding which may have an impact particularly on subjective outcomes such as quality of life. The risk of bias for other criteria could not be clearly stated across the studies. Authors' conclusions We found no conclusive evidence that an oral anti‐pseudomonal antibiotic regimen is more or less effective than an alternative treatment for either pulmonary exacerbations or long‐term treatment of chronic infection with  P. aeruginosa . Until results of adequately‐powered future trials are available, treatment needs to be selected on a pragmatic basis, based upon any available non‐randomised evidence, the clinical circumstances of the individual, the known effectiveness of drugs against local strains and upon individual preference. Plain language summary Oral antibiotics for treating infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We looked for evidence that antibiotics that are swallowed can treat  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  infections in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Treatment of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  lung infection is very important in managing cystic fibrosis lung disease. If oral (taken by mouth) antibiotics are as effective and safe for treating infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  as intravenous (given into a vein) or nebulised (breathed in as a mist) antibiotics the quality of life of people with cystic fibrosis would improve as it would be easier to administer the drugs administration and would avoid being admitted to hospital. We looked for trials in which people had equal chances of being treated with oral antibiotics or an alternative treatment for  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  infections. We thought the most important outcomes to find results for were quality of life and lung function. This is an updated version of a previous review. Search date The evidence is current to: 08 July 2016. Study characteristics We included five trials with 256 participants. Three trials included people experiencing a flare up of disease (171 participants) and two trials looked at long‐term therapy (85 participants). Key results We found no conclusive evidence to show that oral antibiotics were more or less effective than an alternative treatment for either flare ups of disease or long‐term treatment of chronic infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  One of the trials with volunteers being treated for a flare up of disease reported significantly better lung function when using ciprofloxacin compared with intravenous treatment; but we did not agree with this finding when we analysed the same data. We did not find any evidence of differences between oral antibiotics and other treatments in terms of adverse events or the development of antibiotic resistance, but we do note that the trials were not designed to detect such differences. Until the results of large trials are available, people should choose their treatment on a practical basis, basing decisions on any available evidence, their clinical circumstances, the known effectiveness of drugs against local strains of the bug and individual preference. Quality of the evidence The evidence we found was limited. The trials were very different in terms of design, drugs used, length of treatment and follow up and the outcomes measured. We judged the trials to be at different risks of bias, but we did not think any of them had a low risk of bias from blinding, which might affect the results of subjective outcomes like quality of life.","7","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Administration, Oral; Adult; Anti‐Bacterial Agents [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Child; Chronic Disease; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications, microbiology]; Humans; Pseudomonas Infections [*drug therapy]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Tract Infections [*drug therapy, microbiology]; Treatment Outcome","10.1002/14651858.CD005405.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD005405.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Two distinct types of arthritis are described in cystic fibrosis: cystic fibrosis‐related arthropathy and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. Management of arthritis in people with cystic fibrosis is uncertain and complex because of the underlying disease and its treatment. Objectives To review the effectiveness and safety of disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs for the management of arthritis related to cystic fibrosis in adults and children. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database handsearches of relevant journal and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of most recent search: 10 July 2012. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials which compared the efficacy and safety of disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs (e.g. methotrexate, gold, sulfasalazine, penicillamine, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine and newer agents such as biologic disease modifying agents and monoclonal antibodies) with each other, with no treatment or with placebo for cystic fibrosis‐related arthropathy or hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. Data collection and analysis No relevant studies were identified. Main results No studies were included in this review. Authors' conclusions Although it is generally recognised that cystic fibrosis‐related arthritis can be episodic and resolve spontaneously, treatment with analgesics and anti‐inflammatory agents may be needed. But when episodic symptoms progress to persistent disease, disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs may be needed to limit the course of the disease. It is disappointing that no randomised controlled trials to rigorously evaluate these drugs could be found. This systematic review has identified the need for a well‐designed adequately powered randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs for the management of cystic fibrosis‐related arthropathy and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy in adults and children with cystic fibrosis. However, given the infrequency of cystic fibrosis‐related arthritis and the range of symptoms and severity, randomised controlled trials may not be feasible and well‐designed non‐randomised observational studies may be more appropriate. Studies should also better define the two conditions. Plain language summary The use of drugs to slow or stop progression of arthritis related to cystic fibrosis Arthritis is not a common complication of cystic fibrosis, but it can cause major problems when it does occur. There are two distinct types of arthritis in cystic fibrosis: cystic fibrosis‐related arthropathy and hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy. The best treatment for these types of arthritis is not clear because of cystic fibrosis and its intense treatment. Some drugs can treat the symptoms of arthritis by reducing inflammation of the joints and relieving pain, but only disease modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs can stop or slow progression of the disease. We planned to report evidence from clinical trials which compared different disease‐modifying drugs compared with placebo (or dummy treatment), with each other or with no treatment. However, we were disappointed that we could not find any completed randomised controlled trials of these treatments or any evidence from non‐randomised controlled trials. We suggest that there should be a randomised controlled trial to look at the effects and the safety of using disease modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs to slow or stop the progression of arthritis in people with cystic fibrosis.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Antirheumatic Agents [*therapeutic use]; Arthritis [*drug therapy, etiology]; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Humans","10.1002/14651858.CD007336.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007336.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

It is characterized by anaemia, increased susceptibility to infections and episodes of pain. The disease is acquired by inheriting abnormal genes from both parents, the combination giving rise to different forms of the disease. Due to increased erythropoiesis in people with SCD, it is hypothesized that they are at an increased risk for folate deficiency. For this reason, children and adults with SCD, particularly those with sickle cell anaemia, commonly take 1 mg of folic acid orally every day on the premise that this will replace depleted folate stores and reduce the symptoms of anaemia. It is thus important to evaluate the role of folate supplementation in treating SCD. Objectives To analyse the efficacy and possible adverse effects of folate supplementation (folate occurring naturally in foods, provided as fortified foods or additional supplements such as tablets) in people with SCD. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group’s Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also conducted additional searches in both electronic databases and clinical trial registries. Date of last search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group’s Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 17 November 2017. Selection criteria Randomised, placebo‐controlled trials of folate supplementation for SCD. Data collection and analysis Four review authors assessed We used the standard Cochrane‐defined methodological procedures. Four review authors independently assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of the included trials and extracted and analysed the data included in the review. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Main results One trial, undertaken in 1983, was eligible for inclusion in the review. This was a double‐blind placebo‐controlled quasi‐randomised triaI of supplementation of folic acid in people with SCD. A total of 117 children with homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease aged six months to four years of age participated over a one‐year period (analysis was restricted to 115 children). Serum folate measures, obtained after trial entry at six and 12 months, were available in 80 of 115 (70%) participants. There were significant differences between the folic acid and placebo groups with regards to serum folate values above 18 µg/L and values below 5 µg/L (low‐quality evidence). In the folic acid group, values above 18 µg/L were observed in 33 of 41 (81%) compared to six of 39 (15%) participants in the placebo (calcium lactate) group. Additionally, there were no participants in the folic acid group with serum folate levels below 5 µg/L, whereas in the placebo group, 15 of 39 (39%) participants had levels below this threshold. Haematological indices were measured in 100 of 115 (87%) participants at baseline and at one year. After adjusting for sex and age group, the investigators reported no significant differences between the trial groups with regards to total haemoglobin concentrations, either at baseline or at one year (low‐quality evidence). It is important to note that none of the raw data for the outcomes listed above were available for analysis. The proportions of participants who experienced certain clinical events were analysed in all 115 participants, for which raw data were available. There were no statistically significant differences noted; however, the trial was not powered to investigate differences between the folic acid and placebo groups with regards to: minor infections, risk ratio (RR) 0.99 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.15) (low‐quality evidence); major infections, RR 0.89 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.66) (low‐quality evidence); dactylitis, RR 0.67 (95% CI 0.35 to 1.27) (low‐quality evidence); acute splenic sequestration, RR 1.07 (95% CI 0.44 to 2.57) (low‐quality evidence); or episodes of pain, RR 1.16 (95% CI 0.70 to 1.92) (low‐quality evidence). However, the investigators reported a higher proportion of repeat dactylitis episodes in the placebo group, with two or more attacks occurring in 10 of 56 participants compared to two of 59 in the folic acid group (P < 0.05). Growth, determined by height‐for‐age and weight‐for‐age, as well as height and growth velocity, was measured in 103 of the 115 participants (90%), for which raw data were not available. The investigators reported no significant differences in growth between the two groups. The trial had a high risk of bias with regards to random sequence generation and incomplete outcome data. There was an unclear risk of bias in relation to allocation concealment, outcome assessment, and selective reporting. Finally, There was a low risk of bias with regards to blinding of participants and personnel. Overall the quality of the evidence in the review was low. There were no trials identified for other eligible comparisons, namely: folate supplementation (fortified foods and physical supplementation with tablets) versus placebo; folate supplementation (naturally occurring in diet) versus placebo; folate supplementation (fortified foods and physical supplementation with tablets) versus folate supplementation (naturally occurring in diet). Authors' conclusions One doubIe‐blind, placebo‐controlled triaI on folic acid supplementation in children with SCD was included in the review. Overall, the trial presented mixed evidence on the review's outcomes. No trials in adults were identified. With the limited evidence provided, we conclude that, while it is possible that folic acid supplementation may increase serum folate levels, the effect of supplementation on anaemia and any symptoms of anaemia remains unclear. If further trials were conducted, these may add evidence regarding the efficacy of folate supplementation. Future trials should assess clinical outcomes such as folate concentration, haemoglobin concentration, adverse effects and benefits of the intervention, especially with regards to SCD‐related morbidity. Such trials should include people with SCD of all ages and both sexes, in any setting. To investigate the effects of folate supplementation, trials should recruit more participants and be of longer duration, with long‐term follow‐up, than the trial currently included in this review. However, we do not envisage further trials of this intervention will be conducted, and hence the review will no longer be regularly updated. Plain language summary Folate supplementation in people with sickle cell disease Review question We wanted to assess how effective and safe folate supplementation (folate occurring naturally in foods, provided as fortified foods or additional supplements such as tablets) is in people with sickle cell disease (SCD). Background SCD is a group of disorders affecting haemoglobin (the molecule in red blood cells that delivers oxygen to cells throughout the body), leading to distorted sickle or crescent‐shaped red blood cells. It is characterized by anaemia (the blood cannot carry enough oxygen around the body), repeated infections and episodes of pain. While SCD was originally found in the tropics and subtropics, due to migration, it is now common worldwide. There are three widely‐used preventative measures for managing SCD, these include penicillin, immunisation against pneumococcal infection and folate supplementation. Folate is a water‐soluble B vitamin needed for erythropoiesis (the process which produces red blood cells). Given there is increased erythropoiesis in people with SCD, it is thought they may require increased folate intake, by supplements or through diet. However, a lack of evidence‐based research means it is still not clear whether the benefits of supplementation outweigh the risk of possible adverse effects. Search date The evidence is current to: 17 November 2017. Study characteristics We included one trial with 117 children with SCD aged between six months and four years. This was a one‐year doubIe‐blind (both participants and doctors did not know which treatment group the participants were allocated to) controlled triaI comparing children taking folic acid supplements to those taking a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment). Key results The trial investigators reported that folic acid supplementation led to higher levels of folic acid measured in the blood. However, there were no differences in haemoglobin concentrations at the end of one year. The trial also reported on clinical factors linked to treatment, including growth, major and minor infections, acute splenic sequestration, episodes of bone or abdominal pains. The investigators reported no differences in these outcomes from baseline to the end of the trial; however, the trial was not large enough to detect any possible differences reported between the folic acid group and the placebo group. Quality of the evidence In the included trial it was not clear how participants were allocated to receive folic acid or placebo. The method of making sure that participants and trial staff did not know what treatment each person was receiving (called allocation concealment) was also not described. These two factors mean that the trial had a high risk of biased results. The trial did not contain many participants. For many of its clinical endpoints, it was not designed to show differences between people taking folic acid and those taking a placebo. This means that the results from this trial are imprecise, and therefore hard to interpret. Finally, our review was meant to investigate folate supplementation (folate occurring naturally in foods, provided as fortified foods or additional supplements such as tablets) in children and adults. Because we only identified one trial that investigated one form of supplementation in children, the results are not useful for other populations. Therefore, we judged the evidence from the included trial to be of low quality. Based on just one low quality study with evidence only to show that folate supplementation raises the blood levels of folic acid, we cannot state whether this treatment is effective or not. More trials with more people and longer treatment duration (and follow‐up) of folate supplementation in people with SCD are needed to strengthen this review; however, we do not envisage further trials of this intervention will be conducted, and hence the review will no longer be regularly updated.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Anemia, Sickle Cell [blood, *drug therapy]; Child, Preschool; Double-Blind Method; Erythrocyte Indices; Folic Acid [*administration & dosage, blood]; Growth; Hematinics [*administration & dosage]; Humans; Infant","10.1002/14651858.CD011130.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011130.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD002202.PUB3","Rankine-Mullings, AE; Nevitt, SJ","Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) for sickle cell disease","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2022","Abstract - Background Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common inherited diseases worldwide. It is associated with lifelong morbidity and a reduced life expectancy. Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide), an oral chemotherapeutic drug, ameliorates some of the clinical problems of SCD, in particular that of pain, by raising foetal haemoglobin (HbF). This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives The aims of this review are to determine through a review of randomised or quasi‐randomised studies whether the use of hydroxyurea in people with SCD alters the pattern of acute events, including pain; prevents, delays or reverses organ dysfunction; alters mortality and quality of life; or is associated with adverse effects. In addition, we hoped to assess whether the response to hydroxyurea in SCD varies with the type of SCD, age of the individual, duration and dose of treatment, and healthcare setting. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Haemoglobinopathies Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched online trial registries. The date of the most recent search was 17 February 2022. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials (RCTs and quasi‐RCTs), of one month or longer, comparing hydroxyurea with placebo or standard therapy in people  with SCD. Data collection and analysis Authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, carried out data extraction, assessed the risk of bias and assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. Main results We included nine RCTs recruiting 1104 adults and children with SCD (haemoglobin SS (HbSS), haemoglobin SC (HbSC) or haemoglobin Sβºthalassaemia (HbSβºthal) genotypes). Studies lasted from six to 30 months. We judged the quality of the evidence for the first two comparisons below as moderate to low as the studies contributing to these comparisons were mostly large and well‐designed (and at low risk of bias); however, the evidence was limited and imprecise for some outcomes such as quality of life, deaths during the studies and adverse events, and the results are applicable only to individuals with HbSS and HbSβºthal genotypes. We judged the quality of the evidence for the third and fourth comparisons to be very low due to the limited number of participants, the lack of statistical power (both studies were terminated early with approximately only 20% of their target sample size recruited) and the lack of applicability to all age groups and genotypes. Hydroxyurea versus placebo Five studies (784 adults and children with HbSS or HbSβºthal) compared hydroxyurea to placebo; four recruited individuals with only severe disease and one recruited individuals with all disease severities. Hydroxyurea probably improves pain alteration (using measures such as pain crisis frequency, duration, intensity, hospital admissions and opoid use) and life‐threatening illness, but we found no difference in death rates (10 deaths occurred during the studies, but the rates did not differ by treatment group) (all moderate‐quality evidence). Hydroxyurea may improve measures of HbF (low‐quality evidence) and probably decreases neutrophil counts (moderate‐quality evidence). There were no consistent differences in terms of quality of life and adverse events (including serious or life‐threatening events) (low‐quality evidence). There were fewer occurrences of acute chest syndrome and blood transfusions in the hydroxyurea groups.  Hydroxyurea and phlebotomy versus transfusion and chelation Two studies (254 children with HbSS or HbSβºthal also with risk of primary or secondary stroke) contributed to this comparison. There were no consistent differences in terms of pain alteration, death or adverse events (low‐quality evidence) or life‐threatening illness (moderate‐quality evidence). Hydroxyurea with phlebotomy probably increased HbF and decreased neutrophil counts (moderate‐quality evidence), but there were more occurrences of acute chest syndrome and infections. Quality of life was not reported. In the primary prevention study, no strokes occurred in either treatment group but in the secondary prevention study, seven strokes occurred in the hydroxyurea and phlebotomy group (none in the transfusion and chelation group) and the study was terminated early.  Hydroxyurea versus observation One study (22 children with HbSS or HbSβºthal also at risk of stoke) compared hydroxyurea to observation. Pain alteration and quality of life were not reported. There were no differences in life‐threatening illness, death (no deaths reported in either group) or adverse events (very low‐quality evidence). We are uncertain if hydroxyurea improves HbF or decreases neutrophil counts (very low‐quality evidence). Treatment regimens with and without hydroxyurea One study (44 adults and children with HbSC) compared treatment regimens with and without hydroxyurea. Pain alteration, life‐threatening illness and quality of life were not reported. There were no differences in death rates (no deaths reported in either group), adverse events or neutrophil levels (very low‐quality evidence). We are uncertain if hydroxyurea improves HbF (very low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions There is evidence to suggest that hydroxyurea may be effective in decreasing the frequency of pain episodes and other acute complications in adults and children with sickle cell anaemia of HbSS or HbSβºthal genotypes and in preventing life‐threatening neurological events in those with sickle cell anaemia at risk of primary stroke by maintaining transcranial Doppler velocities. However, there is still insufficient evidence on the long‐term benefits of hydroxyurea, particularly with regard to preventing chronic complications of SCD, or recommending a standard dose or dose escalation to maximum tolerated dose. There is also insufficient evidence about the long‐term risks of hydroxyurea, including its effects on fertility and reproduction. Evidence is also limited on the effects of hydroxyurea on individuals with the HbSC genotype. Future studies should be designed to address such uncertainties. Plain language summary Hydroxyurea (also known as hydroxycarbamide) for people with sickle cell disease Review question What is the effect of hydroxyurea on clinical outcomes (changes in pain crises, life‐threatening illnesses, survival, haemoglobin levels, quality of life and side effects) in people with sickle cell disease (SCD) of any genotype? Background Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited genetic disorder that creates problems with haemoglobin (the substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body). The disease can be inherited in different ways; people can inherit two sickle genes (HbSS genotype) or they can inherit the sickle gene from one parent and a different haemoglobin gene such as haemoglobin C, resulting in the HbSC genotype, or a beta thalassaemia gene from the second parent, which gives rise to HbSβ+ or HbSβºthal.  In people with SCD the abnormal sickle haemoglobin forms long polymers (chains) within the red blood cells when they become de‐oxygenated. This damages the red blood cells and makes them stickier, leading to blockages and reduced blood flow, causing pain and organ damage. Foetal haemoglobin (HbF) stops these polymers forming in the sickle haemoglobin within the red blood cell. The drug hydroxyurea is used to increase HbF and can reduce the effects of the disease. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Search date The evidence is current to 17 February 2022. Study characteristics We included nine randomised studies (1104 adults and children with SCD (HbSS, HbSC or HbSβºthal genotypes)). Studies lasted from six to 30 months. Key results and quality of the evidence In five studies, 784 adults and children with SCD were randomly selected to receive hydroxyurea or placebo. In two studies, 254 children with SCD, who were also at an increased risk of having a first or second stroke, were randomly selected to receive hydroxyurea and phlebotomy (collection of blood) or blood transfusion and chelation (administration of agents to remove excess iron from the body). These seven studies only recruited people with HbSS or HbSβºthal genotypes so the results do not apply to people with the HbSC genotype. There was moderate‐quality evidence from these seven studies that hydroxyurea may reduce the frequency of pain crises, may increase HbF and may decrease neutrophil (white blood cell) counts compared to the comparator treatment. We found no difference between people receiving hydroxyurea or other treatments in terms of quality of life, deaths during the studies and adverse effects (including serious and life‐threatening effects). However, there is less information about these outcomes in the studies, so the quality of this evidence is low. Two further studies were included in the review. In one study, 22 children with SCD, who were also at increased risk of having a stroke, were randomly selected to receive hydroxyurea or no treatment (observation only) and in one study 44 adults and children were randomly selected to receive treatments with or without adding hydroxyurea. In both studies we are unsure if hydroxyurea led to an increase in HbF compared to the comparator treatment. There were no deaths during the studies. There was no difference between people receiving hydroxyurea or other treatments in terms of pain crises and adverse effects (including serious or life‐threatening effects) and neither study measured quality of life. The quality of the evidence from these studies is very low, given the studies were very small and only recruited around 20% of the intended number of people, and the results do not apply to all people with SCD (different genotypes). Conclusions The evidence shows that hydroxyurea is likely to be effective in the short term at decreasing the frequency of painful episodes and raising HbF levels in the blood in people with SCD. Hydroxyurea is also likely to be effective in preventing first strokes for those at an increased risk of stroke and does not seem to be associated with an increase in any adverse effects (including serious and life‐threatening effects). There is currently little evidence from the studies that we examined on whether hydroxyurea is beneficial over a long period of time, what the best dose to take is, or whether treatment causes any long‐term or serious side effects. More studies are needed to answer these questions.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Acute Chest Syndrome [chemically induced, complications, drug therapy]; *Anemia, Sickle Cell [complications, drug therapy]; *Stroke [prevention & control]; Adult; Antisickling Agents [adverse effects]; Child; Hemoglobin, Sickle [therapeutic use]; Humans; Hydroxyurea [adverse effects]; Pain [drug therapy]","10.1002/14651858.CD002202.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002202.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

ABPA is associated with an accelerated decline in lung function. High doses of corticosteroids are the main treatment for ABPA; although the long‐term benefits are not clear, and their many side effects are well‐documented. A group of compounds, the azoles, have activity against  A fumigatus , and have been proposed as an alternative treatment for ABPA. Of this group, itraconazole is the most active. A separate antifungal compound, amphotericin B, has been used in aerosolised form to treat invasive infection with  A fumigatus , and may have potential for the treatment of ABPA. Antifungal therapy for ABPA in cystic fibrosis needs to be evaluated. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives The review aimed to test the hypotheses that antifungal interventions for the treatment of ABPA in cystic fibrosis: 1. improve clinical status compared to placebo or standard therapy (no placebo); and 2. do not have unacceptable adverse effects. If benefit was demonstrated, we planned to assess the optimal type, duration, and dose of antifungal therapy. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals, and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Trials Register was 28 September 2021. We searched ongoing trials registries, most recently on 11 March 2022. Earlier, we also approached pharmaceutical companies regarding possible unpublished trials. Selection criteria Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials, in which antifungal treatments were compared to either placebo or no treatment, or where different doses of the same treatment were used in the treatment of ABPA in people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis The searches identified six trials; none of which met the inclusion criteria for the review. Main results We included no completed randomised controlled trials. There is currently one ongoing trial, which we may find eligible for a future update. Authors' conclusions At present, there are no randomised controlled trials that evaluate the use of antifungal therapies for the treatment of ABPA in people with cystic fibrosis, although one trial is currently ongoing. Trials with clear outcome measures are needed to properly evaluate the use of corticosteroids in people with ABPA and cystic fibrosis. Plain language summary Treatments to fight fungal infections that cause allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We planned to review the evidence about the effect of treatments to fight fungal infections that cause allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in people with cystic fibrosis. Background ABPA is an allergic lung reaction to a type of fungus (usually  Aspergillus fumigatus ) in some people with cystic fibrosis. It causes a cough and wheezing, and sometimes fever. If left untreated, ABPA can lead to long‐term lung damage. It is usually treated with a high dose of corticosteroids (also known as steroids). However, it has not been proven that corticosteroids can prevent lung function from deteriorating in the long term. Also, long‐term use of corticosteroids is linked to some serious side effects. Treating the fungus that causes ABPA may be an alternative to using high doses of corticosteroids to combat the allergic reaction. This is an update of a previously published review. Search date The evidence is current to 28 September 2021. Study characteristics We did not find any trials that we could include in the review. Key results There is currently no evidence to recommend the use of antifungal treatment in people with cystic fibrosis and ABPA. We need trials to assess the effects of corticosteroids in this population in the long and the short term.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Aspergillosis, Allergic Bronchopulmonary [complications, drug therapy]; *Cystic Fibrosis [complications, drug therapy]; Antifungal Agents [therapeutic use]; Aspergillus fumigatus; Humans; Itraconazole [therapeutic use]","10.1002/14651858.CD002204.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002204.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Standard treatment, usually steroids alone, or in combination with cyclophosphamide, aims to stop acute bleeds by using haemostatic agents to promote clotting. Rituximab may be an alternative approach to the treatment of acquired haemophilia by eradicating FVIII autoantibodies. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives To assess the efficacy and adverse effects of rituximab for treating people with acquired haemophilia A. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's trials registers, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and conference proceedings (January 2021). We also undertook searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE and online trial registries (January 2021). Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials of rituximab for people with acquired haemophilia A, with no restrictions on gender, age or ethnicity. Data collection and analysis No trials matching the selection criteria were eligible for inclusion. Main results No trials matching the selection criteria were eligible for inclusion. Authors' conclusions We found no randomised clinical trials of rituximab for acquired haemophilia A. Thus, we are not able to draw any conclusions or make any recommendations on rituximab for eradicating inhibitors in people with acquired haemophilia A based on the highest quality evidence. Given that undertaking randomised controlled trials in this field is a complex task, we suggest that, while planning such trials, clinicians treating the disease continue to base their choices on alternative, lower‐quality sources of evidence. In a future update of this review, we plan to appraise and incorporate eligible randomised controlled trials, as well as other high‐quality, non‐randomised studies. Plain language summary Rituximab for eradicating inhibitors in people with acquired haemophilia A Review question Is the medicine rituximab safe and effective for treating people with acquired haemophilia A? Background Acquired haemophilia A is a rare but severe bleeding disorder. It is caused by an autoantibody directed against factor VIII (FVIII, a blood clotting protein) in people with no previous history of a bleeding disorder. This bleeding disorder occurs more often in the elderly and may be associated with several other conditions (e.g. solid tumours and autoimmune diseases), or with medication. It sometimes happens in pregnancy. However, in about half of cases, the causes are unknown. Bleeding occurs in the skin, mucous membranes, and muscles. Bleeds into the joints are unusual. Doctors looking after people with acquired haemophilia A aim to stop acute bleeding episodes and to remove factor VIII autoantibodies. Most doctors regard medicines which suppress the body's immune system (in particular, the corticosteroid prednisone, sometimes in combination with another medicine, cyclophosphamide) as the most effective inital treatment option for acquired haemophilia A. However, up to one‐third of people do not respond to this treatment. Search date The evidence is current to 18 January 2021. Key results We did not find any randomised controlled trials to include in this review. We have not been able to draw a definitive conclusion on the best available treatment. Randomised controlled trials are needed to evaluate the exact role of rituximab in treating acquired haemophilia A, but the rarity of the condition is an obstacle to the planning and execution of such trials. While waiting for better evidence, people with haemophilia and doctors need to base treatment decisions on the larger and better‐conducted observational studies.

People with CF often have malnutrition and growth delay. Adequate nutritional supplementation does not improve growth optimally and hence an anabolic agent, recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH), has been proposed as a potential intervention. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of rhGH therapy in improving lung function, quality of life and clinical status of children and young adults with CF. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of latest search: 12 January 2021. We also searched ongoing trials registers: clinicaltrials.gov from the United States ‐ date of latest search 19 Jun 2021; WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) ‐ date of latest search 05 March 2018 (not available in 2021).  We conducted a search of relevant endocrine journals and proceedings of the Endocrinology Society meetings using Web of Science, Scopus and Proceedings First. Date of latest search: 21 Jun 2021.  Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials of all preparations of rhGH compared to either no treatment, or placebo, or each other at any dose (high‐dose and low‐dose) or route and for any duration, in children or young adults (aged up to 25 years) diagnosed with CF (by sweat test or genetic testing). Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened papers, extracted trial details and assessed their risk of bias. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE system. Main results We included eight trials (291 participants, aged between five and 23 years) in the current version of the review. Seven trials compared standard‐dose rhGH (approximately 0.3 mg/kg/week) to no treatment and one three‐arm trial (63 participants) compared placebo, standard‐dose rhGH (0.3 mg/kg/week) and high‐dose rhGH (0.5 mg/kg/week). Six trials lasted for one year and two trials for six months. We found that rhGH treatment may improve some of the pulmonary function outcomes, but there was no difference between standard and high‐dose levels (low‐certainty evidence, limited by inconsistency across the trials, small number of participants and short duration of therapy). The trials show evidence of improvement in the anthropometric parameters (height, weight and lean body mass) with rhGH therapy, again no differences between dose levels. We found improvement in height for all comparisons (very low‐ to low‐certainty evidence), but improvements in weight and lean body mass were only reported for standard‐dose rhGH versus no treatment (very low‐certainty evidence). There is some evidence indicating a change in the level of fasting blood glucose with rhGH therapy, however, it did not cross the clinical threshold for diagnosis of diabetes in the trials of short duration (low‐certainty evidence). There is low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence for improvement of pulmonary exacerbations with no further significant adverse effects, but this is limited by the short duration of trials and the small number of participants. One small trial provided inconsistent evidence on improvement in quality of life (very low‐certainty evidence). There is limited evidence from three trials in improvements in exercise capacity (low‐certainty evidence). None of the trials have systematically compared the expense of therapy on overall healthcare costs. Authors' conclusions When compared with no treatment, rhGH therapy is effective in improving the intermediate outcomes in height, weight and lean body mass. Some measures of pulmonary function showed moderate improvement, but no consistent benefit was seen across all trials. The significant change in blood glucose levels, although not causing diabetes, emphasizes the need for careful monitoring of this adverse effect with therapy in a population predisposed to CF‐related diabetes. No significant changes in quality of life, clinical status or side‐effects were observed in this review due to the small number of participants. Long‐term, well‐designed randomised controlled trials of rhGH in individuals with CF are required prior to routine clinical use of rhGH in CF. Plain language summary The use of recombinant growth hormone to improve growth and health in children and young adults with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effects of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) on the health of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Background CF is an inherited condition causing disease in the lungs, digestive system and pancreas. People with CF are often underweight and have delayed growth, which may impact their lung function. Nutritional supplements may not be enough and it has been suggested that treatment with rhGH, which improves the rate of growth and bone density, might help. Treatment with rhGH is usually given once a day via a needle under the skin. It is expensive and may affect glucose metabolism that has implications for children at risk of CF‐related diabetes. Hence, we need to critically review the risks and benefits of this treatment. This is an update of an earlier review. Search date The evidence is current to: 12 January 2021. Study characteristics This review looked at using of rhGH to improve lung function, growth and quality of life for children and young adults with CF. It includes eight trials with 291 individuals with CF being selected for one treatment or the other randomly. The individuals in the trials were five to 23 years old, but most had not yet reached puberty. Six trials lasted for one year and two trials for six months. Treatment with rhGH was compared to no treatment in seven trials and to a placebo (a liquid that did not contain any growth hormone) in one trial. The trial that used a placebo compared it to two different doses of rhGH treatment. Key results Results showed a modest improvement in height, weight and lean body mass between six and 12 months. However, there was no consistent evidence that rhGH treatment improves lung function, muscle strength, or quality of life. The trials were small and we did not find any evidence on changes in glucose metabolism or the long‐term risk of diabetes due to the treatment. Given these results, we are not able to identify any clear benefit of therapy and believe that more research from well‐designed, adequately powered clinical trials is needed. Certainty of the evidence We did not have enough information to decide if overall the trials were biased in a way that might affect the results. All the measured outcomes were clearly reported in the trials, but the trials were small and did not have enough participants to show a difference that may not have been due to chance. We also had concerns that outcomes that were based on personal judgment, such as quality of life scores, might be affected because those taking part in seven of the trials were able to tell which group they were in.","8","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Cystic Fibrosis [complications, drug therapy]; *Diabetes Mellitus; *Human Growth Hormone; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Growth Hormone; Humans; Quality of Life; Young Adult","10.1002/14651858.CD008901.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008901.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

This is an updated version of a previously published review. Objectives To determine whether there is evidence that omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation reduces morbidity and mortality and to identify any adverse events associated with supplementation. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of last search: 01 April 2020. We also searched online study registries and contacted authors. Date of last search: 12 February 2020. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials in people with cystic fibrosis comparing omega‐3 fatty acid supplements with placebo. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the studies. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Main results The searches identified 23 studies; five studies with 106 participants (children and adults) were included; duration of studies and interventions differed. Two studies compared omega‐3 fatty acids to olive oil for six weeks; one study compared omega‐3 fatty acids and omega‐6 fatty acids to control capsules (customised fatty acid blends) for three months; one study compared a liquid dietary supplement containing omega‐3 fatty acids to one without for six months; and one study compared omega‐3 fatty acids to a placebo for 12 months. Three studies had a low risk of bias for randomisation, but the risk was unclear in the remaining two studies; all studies had an unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment. Three of the studies adequately blinded participants; the risk of bias for selective reporting was high in one study and unclear for four studies. Two studies reported the number of respiratory exacerbations. At three months, one study (43 participants) reported no change in antibiotic usage. At 12 months the second study (15 participants) reported a reduction in the number of pulmonary exacerbations and cumulative antibiotic days in the supplement group compared to the previous year (no data for the control group); very low‐quality evidence means we are unsure whether supplementation has any effect on this outcome. With regards to adverse events, one six‐week study (12 participants) reported no difference in diarrhoea between omega‐3 or placebo capsules; the very low‐quality evidence means we are unsure if supplementation has any effect on this outcome. Additionally, one study reported an increase in steatorrhoea requiring participants to increase their daily dose of pancreatic enzymes, but three studies had already increased pancreatic enzyme dose at study begin so as to reduce the incidence of steatorrhoea. One study (43 participants) reported stomach pains at three months (treatment or control group not specified). One six‐week study (19 participants) reported three asthma exacerbations leading to exclusion of participants since corticosteroid treatment could affect affect essential fatty acid metabolism. Four studies reported lung function. One six‐week study (19 participants) reported an increase in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) (L) and forced vital capacity (FVC) (L), but the very low‐quality evidence means we are unsure if supplementation has any effect on lung function. The remaining studies did not report any difference in lung function at three months (unit of measurement not specified) or at six months and one year (FEV 1  % predicted and FVC % predicted). No deaths were reported in any of the five studies. Four studies reported clinical variables. One study reported an increase in Schwachman score and weight alongside a reduction in sputum volume with supplementation compared to placebo at three months (data not analysable). However, three studies reported no differences in either weight at six weeks, in body mass index (BMI) standard deviation (SD) score at six months (very low‐quality evidence) or BMI Z score at 12 months. Three studies reported biochemical markers of fatty acid status. One study showed an increase from baseline in both EPA and DHA content of serum phospholipids in the omega‐3 group compared to placebo at three months and also a significant decrease in n‐6/n‐3 ratio in the supplement group compared to placebo; since the quality of the evidence is very low we are not certain that these changes are due to supplementation. One six‐month cross‐over study showed a higher EPA content of the neutrophil membrane in the supplement group compared to the placebo group, but, no difference in DHA membrane concentration. Furthermore, the leukotriene B 4  to leukotriene B 5  ratio was lower at six months in the omega‐3 group compared to placebo. A one‐year study reported a greater increase in the essential fatty acid profile and a decrease in AA levels in the treatment arm compared to placebo. Authors' conclusions This review found that regular omega‐3 supplements may provide some limited benefits for people with cystic fibrosis with relatively few adverse effects: however, the quality of the evidence across all outcomes was very low. The current evidence is insufficient to draw firm conclusions or recommend routine use of these supplements in people with cystic fibrosis. A large, long‐term, multicentre, randomised controlled study is needed to determine any significant therapeutic effect and to assess the influence of disease severity, dosage and duration of treatment. Future researchers should note the need for additional pancreatic enzymes when providing omega‐3 supplementation or olive oil placebo capsules. More research is required to determine the exact dose of pancreatic enzyme required. Plain language summary The use of omega‐3 supplements in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of giving omega‐3 supplements to people with cystic fibrosis. Background In people with cystic fibrosis recurring cycles of infection and inflammation are thought to worsen lung function. Studies suggest that omega‐3 fatty acids, such as those derived from fish oils, may work to counter the inflammation and may be of benefit in chronic inflammatory diseases including cystic fibrosis. This is an updated version of the review. Search date The evidence is current to: 01 April 2020. Study characteristics This review includes five small studies which compare omega‐3 supplements to a different supplement without omega‐3. In total there were 106 participants, including both children and adults. The studies lasted between six weeks and 12 months. Key results Due to the very low‐quality evidence, we are uncertain whether the following effects are due to supplementation or not. One 12‐month study reported a reduction in pulmonary exacerbations and antibiotic use when taking omega‐3 supplementation compared to placebo and one three‐month study reported no change in antibiotic use during the study period. Few side effects were reported in any of the studies. One six‐week study reported that lung function and clinical status improved when taking omega‐3 supplements. Sputum levels were also noted to be reduced in this six‐week study. Three studies reported no difference in lung function when taking omega‐3 supplementation compared to placebo. Two longer studies found that people taking omega‐3 supplements showed definite increases in levels of essential fatty acids in their white blood cell membranes and also in levels of phospholipids (molecules that provide structure and protection to cells) measured in blood samples. We are uncertain whether regular omega‐3 supplements benefit people with cystic fibrosis and whether they cause side effects, or not. We are not able to draw firm conclusions or recommend the routine use of these supplements in people with cystic fibrosis. Larger and longer studies are needed to assess the clinical benefit of omega‐3 supplementation and to determine the appropriate dosage. Quality of the evidence We judged the quality of the evidence to be very low due to very low participant numbers, low event rates, limited reporting and poor study design. There was no consistency with regards to the time points when results were reported or the measurements used for the same outcome in different studies.","4","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Dietary Supplements; Adult; Bias; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [blood, *diet therapy]; Disease Progression; Fatty Acids, Omega‐3 [*administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Fatty Acids, Omega‐6 [administration & dosage]; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Olive Oil [administration & dosage]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Vital Capacity","10.1002/14651858.CD002201.pub6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002201.pub6","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

The crises are conventionally treated with opioids, non‐opioids and other adjuvants with the risk of developing complications, addictions and drug‐seeking behaviour. Different non‐pharmacological treatments, such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) have been used for managing pain in other painful conditions. Hence, the efficacy of TENS for managing pain in SCD needs to be reviewed. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of TENS for managing pain in people with SCD who experience pain crises or chronic pain (or both). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Register, comprising of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched online trial registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of the last search: 26 Febraury 2020. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs, where TENS was evaluated for managing pain in people with SCD. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of the trials identified by the literature searches according to the inclusion criteria. Two review authors then independently extracted data, assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane standard tool and rated the quality of evidence using the GRADE guidelines. Main results One double‐blind cross‐over RCT with 22 participants with SCD (aged 12 to 27 years) was eligible for inclusion. Following stratification into four pain crises severity grades, participants were then randomised to receive TENS or placebo (sham TENS). The trial was concluded after 60 treatment episodes (30 treatment episodes of each treatment group). There is a lack of clarity regarding the trial design and the analysis of the cross‐over data. If a participant was allocated to TENS treatment for an episode of pain and subsequently returned with a further episode of a similar degree of pain, they would then receive the sham TENS treatment (cross‐over design). For those experiencing a pain episode of a different severity, it is not clear whether they were re‐randomised or given the alternate treatment. Reporting and analysis was based on the total number pain events and not on the number of participants. It is unclear how many participants were crossed over from the TENS group to the sham TENS group and vice versa. The trial had a high risk of bias regarding random sequence generation and allocation concealment; an unclear risk regarding the blinding of participants and personnel; and a low risk regarding the blinding of the outcome assessors and selective outcome reporting. The trial was small and of very low quality; furthermore, given the issue with trial design we were unable to quantitatively analyse the data. Therefore, we present only a narrative summary and caution is advised in interpreting the results. In relation to our pre‐defined primary outcomes, the included trial did not report pain relief at two to four weeks post intervention. The trial authors reported that no difference was found in the changes in pain ratings (recorded at one hour and four hours post intervention) between the TENS and the placebo groups. In relation to our secondary outcomes, the analgesic usage during the trial also did not show any difference between groups. Given the quality of the evidence, we are uncertain whether TENS improves overall satisfaction as compared to sham TENS. The ability to cope with activities of daily living was not evaluated. Regarding adverse events, although one case of itching was reported in the TENS group, the site and nature of itching was not clearly stated; hence it cannot be clearly attributed to TENS. Also, two participants receiving 'sham' TENS reported a worsening of pain with the intervention. Authors' conclusions Since we have only included one small and very low‐quality trial, with a high risk of bias across several domains, we are unable to conclude whether TENS is harmful or beneficial for managing pain in people with SCD. There is a need for a well‐designed, adequately‐powered, RCT to evaluate the role of TENS in managing pain in people with SCD. Plain language summary Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for managing pain in people with sickle cell disease Review question What is the role of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in managing pain in people with sickle cell disease (SCD)? What are the adverse effects of TENS in people with SCD? Background . SCD is an inherited disorder affecting red blood cells. These cells contain haemoglobin which transports oxygen. The diseased red blood cells block the blood vessels and result in a diminished blood supply, leading to less oxygen reaching affected organs and causing episodes of pain and organ damage. Severe pain requires medication and even hospitalisation. Prescribed painkillers can have several side effects, including drug dependency. Hence researchers are looking for options other than drug treatments for people with SCD. TENS is a small battery‐powered electro‐medical device that produces low‐voltage current and is used for pain relief in various painful conditions. It is safe, inexpensive and easy to use. Since mixed responses have been seen in different painful conditions, we felt the need to produce a Cochrane Review with a comprehensive search, to determine the effect of TENS for managing pain in people with SCD. Search date The evidence is current to 26 February 2020. Study characteristics We searched for well‐designed trials to see the effect of TENS compared to 'sham' TENS in people with SCD for relieving pain, reducing the intensity of pain, reducing the frequency of pain episodes, making a difference to the use of painkillers, improving quality of life and for assessing any adverse effects. We only found one trial (22 participants aged between 12 and 27 years). The participants were graded into four groups according to how severe their pain was. On the first visit, the participants from different groups were chosen randomly to receive either TENS or ‘sham’ TENS treatment. For a further crisis of the same severity participants were given the alternative intervention to the first one. For those experiencing a pain episode of a different severity, it is not clear which treatment they were given. Neither the participant nor the researcher were aware of which treatment was received. Key results 30 episodes (across 22 participants) of TENS treatment and 30 of 'sham' TENS treatment were analysed. Due to low‐quality data and issues with the trial design, we can only report in a descriptive way without any formal analysis. Caution should be used in interpreting these results. In the included trial no difference was found in the rating of pain on a scale of 1 to 10 at the end of one hour and four hours between the TENS and 'sham' TENS treatment groups. There was no difference between groups as to how much pain medication was used. Given the very low quality of the evidence, we are also uncertain whether TENS improves overall satisfaction as compared to 'sham' TENS. A minor adverse effect of itching was reported by only one person receiving TENS, whereas two people receiving 'sham' TENS reported a worsening of pain with the intervention. Since there is only one included trial with very low‐quality evidence, we cannot state whether TENS makes any difference to managing pain in people with SCD. Quality of the evidence The trial publication did not clearly report how the randomised list for allocating the participants to the two treatment groups was generated, therefore, we assessed this as having a high risk of bias. The reporting and analysis was based on only the total number pain events and not the number of people reporting pain episodes. It is unclear from this report how many participants were crossed over from TENS to 'sham' TENS treatment group. The first treatment may have an effect on the subsequent treatment and there is no clear data regarding the cross over process from one treatment group to the other. Hence we conclude that the trial has a high risk of bias and the results are hard to interpret.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Analgesics [therapeutic use]; Anemia, Sickle Cell [physiopathology]; Chronic Pain [etiology, *therapy]; Humans; Pain Management [*methods]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation [*methods]","10.1002/14651858.CD012762.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012762.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD008649.PUB4","Nevitt, SJ; Thornton, J; Murray, CS; Dwyer, T","Inhaled mannitol for cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2020","Abstract - Background Several agents are used to clear secretions from the airways of people with cystic fibrosis. Mannitol increases mucociliary clearance, but its exact mechanism of action is unknown. The dry powder formulation of mannitol may be more convenient and easier to use compared with established agents which require delivery via a nebuliser. Phase III trials of inhaled dry powder mannitol for the treatment of cystic fibrosis have been completed and it is now available in Australia and some countries in Europe. This is an update of a previous review. Objectives To assess whether inhaled dry powder mannitol is well tolerated, whether it improves the quality of life and respiratory function in people with cystic fibrosis and which adverse events are associated with the treatment. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic databases, handsearching relevant journals and abstracts from conferences. Date of last search: 12 December 2019. Selection criteria All randomised controlled studies comparing mannitol with placebo, active inhaled comparators (for example, hypertonic saline or dornase alfa) or with no treatment. Data collection and analysis Authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, carried out data extraction and assessed the risk of bias in included studies. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Main results Six studies (reported in 36 unique publications) were included with a total of 784 participants. Duration of treatment in the included studies ranged from 12 days to six months, with open‐label treatment for an additional six months in two of the studies. Five studies compared mannitol with control (a very low dose of mannitol or non‐respirable mannitol) and the final study compared mannitol to dornase alfa alone and to mannitol plus dornase alfa. Two large studies had a similar parallel design and provided data for 600 participants, which could be pooled where data for a particular outcome and time point were available. The remaining studies had much smaller sample sizes (ranging from 22 to 95) and data could not be pooled due to differences in design, interventions and population. Pooled evidence from the two large parallel studies was judged to be of low to moderate quality and from the smaller studies was judged to be of low to very low quality. In all studies, there was an initial test to see if participants tolerated mannitol, with only those who could tolerate the drug being randomised; therefore, the study results are not applicable to the cystic fibrosis population as a whole. While the published papers did not provide all the data required for our analysis, additional unpublished data were provided by the drug's manufacturer and the author of one of the studies. Pooling the large parallel studies comparing mannitol to control, up to and including six months, lung function (forced expiratory volume at one second) measured in both mL and % predicted was significantly improved in the mannitol group compared to the control group (moderate‐quality evidence). Beneficial results were observed in these studies in adults and in both concomitant dornase alfa users and non‐users in these studies. In the smaller studies, statistically significant improvements in lung function were also observed in the mannitol groups compared to the non‐respirable mannitol groups; however, we judged this evidence to be of low to very low quality. For the comparisons of mannitol and control, we found no consistent differences in health‐related quality of life in any of the domains except for burden of treatment, which was less for mannitol up to four months in the two pooled studies of a similar design; this difference was not maintained at six months. It should be noted that the tool used to measure health‐related quality of life was not designed to assess mucolytics and pooling of the age‐appropriate tools (as done in some of the included studies) may not be valid so results were judged to be low to very low quality and should be interpreted with caution. Cough, haemoptysis, bronchospasm, pharyngolaryngeal pain and post‐tussive vomiting were the most commonly reported side effects in both treatment groups. Where rates of adverse events could be compared, statistically no significant differences were found between mannitol and control groups; although some of these events may have clinical relevance for people with CF. For the comparisons of mannitol to dornase alfa alone and to mannitol plus dornase alfa, very low‐quality evidence from a 12‐week cross‐over study of 28 participants showed no statistically significant differences in the recorded domains of health‐related quality of life or measures of lung function. Cough was the most common side effect in the mannitol alone arm but there was no occurrence of cough in the dornase alfa alone arm and the most commonly reported reason of withdrawal from the mannitol plus dornase alfa arm was pulmonary exacerbations. In terms of secondary outcomes of the review (pulmonary exacerbations, hospitalisations, symptoms, sputum microbiology), evidence provided by the included studies was more limited. For all comparisons, no consistent statistically significant and clinically meaningful differences were observed between mannitol and control treatments (including dornase alfa). Authors' conclusions There is moderate‐quality evidence to show that treatment with mannitol over a six‐month period is associated with an improvement in some measures of lung function in people with cystic fibrosis compared to control. There is low to very low‐quality evidence suggesting no difference in quality of life for participants taking mannitol compared to control. This review provides very low‐quality evidence suggesting no difference in lung function or quality of life comparing mannitol to dornase alfa alone and to mannitol plus dornase alfa. The clinical implications from this review suggest that mannitol could be considered as a treatment in cystic fibrosis; but further research is required in order to establish who may benefit most and whether this benefit is sustained in the longer term. Furthermore, studies comparing its efficacy against other (established) mucolytic therapies need to be undertaken before it can be considered for mainstream practice. Plain language summary Mannitol, an inhaled drug, for treating lung disease in cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of inhaling mannitol to treat lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that affects the exocrine glands (sweat glands and others). Lung infections produce thick mucus (phlegm) which can block air passages and cause more infection and repeated inflammation. In turn, this progressively damages the lungs and can eventually cause respiratory failure. There are several drugs that are used to clear mucus from the airways of people with cystic fibrosis and inhaled dry powder mannitol is a new one that may improve their lung function. The dry powder formulation of mannitol may be more convenient and easier to use compared with established agents delivered by a nebuliser (e.g. hypertonic saline). Mannitol is available in Australia and some European countries. This is an updated version of the review. Search date The evidence is current to: 12 December 2019. Study characteristics We included six studies (with a total of 784 adults and children) in this review. Five studies compared a standard dose of mannitol with control (a very low dose of mannitol or a version of mannitol which did not allow the active drug to reach the lungs) and the sixth study compared mannitol with nebulised recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (dornase alfa), both alone and taken together. Participants could continue using dornase alfa and other standard therapies, but were excluded from the five of the six studies if they were using hypertonic saline. Treatment in these studies lasted from 12 days to six months. Five studies provided the treatments to people as outpatients and in one study, the children treated were in hospital due to pulmonary exacerbations (flare ups of disease). Key results It was difficult to combine evidence from the studies in this review due to differences in the designs of the studies, treatments examined and the settings (hospital or outpatients). Some additional information was obtained from the drug manufacturer and one study author to aid the review. The review found low‐ to very low‐quality evidence that there is no difference between mannitol and control treatments or mannitol given either with or without additional dornase alfa in terms of quality of life. There was moderate‐quality evidence of improvements in some measures of lung function across the larger studies comparing mannitol to control. Beneficial effects were also seen in the subgroup of adults and in both those who were using dornase alfa and those who were not. Cough (including coughing up blood), contraction of the airways, pain in the pharynx or larynx and post‐treatment vomiting were the most commonly reported side effects on both treatments, but there was no evidence to suggest that these side effects occurred more on mannitol than on control treatments or on dornase alfa. None of the studies compared mannitol to nebulised hypertonic saline and so we can not comment on which agent is better for airway clearance. More research is needed to answer this question. Quality of the evidence We judged the quality of the evidence from this review to be of very low to moderate quality, depending on the outcome measured. We do not think that the way the studies were designed affected the results. We judged that everyone taking part had equal chances of being in either of the treatment groups and would not have known in advance or during the study which treatment they were receiving. However, the numbers of people who dropped out of the studies might affect how the results are interpreted, as well as how many people were recruited into the studies and how they were selected from all people with cystic fibrosis who could have been included. Although some of these issues were resolved when the drug's manufacturer (who also sponsored the studies) provided some additional information. It is important to realise that before people started the study, they took a test to see if they could tolerate mannitol and only those who did could carry on. This means that the results of the studies only apply to those people with cystic fibrosis who can tolerate mannitol.","5","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Administration, Inhalation; Adult; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*drug therapy, physiopathology]; Deoxyribonuclease I [*administration & dosage]; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Mannitol [*administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Mucociliary Clearance; Powders; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Recombinant Proteins [administration & dosage]; Respiratory Function Tests; Vital Capacity","10.1002/14651858.CD008649.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008649.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD012056.PUB3","Palaniappan, SK; Than, NN; Thein, AW; van Mourik, I","Interventions for preventing and managing advanced liver disease in cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2020","Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive inherited defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene resulting in abnormal regulation of salt and water movement across the membranes. In the liver this leads to focal biliary fibrosis resulting in progressive portal hypertension and end‐stage liver disease in some individuals. This can be asymptomatic, but may lead to splenomegaly and hypersplenism, development of varices and variceal bleeding, and ascites; it has negative impact on overall nutritional status and respiratory function in this population. Prognosis is poor once significant portal hypertension is established. The role and outcome of various interventions for managing advanced liver disease (non‐malignant end stage disease) in people with cystic fibrosis is currently unidentified. This is an updated version of a previously published review. Objectives To review and assess the efficacy of currently available treatment options for preventing and managing advanced liver disease in children and adults with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of last search: 19 November 2019. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews and online trials registries. Date of last search: 01 January 2020. Selection criteria Any published and unpublished randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised controlled trials of advanced liver disease in cystic fibrosis with cirrhosis or liver failure, portal hypertension or variceal bleeding (or both). Data collection and analysis Authors independently examined titles and abstracts to identify potentially relevant trials, but none were eligible for inclusion in this review. Main results A comprehensive search of the literature did not identify any published eligible randomised controlled trials. Authors' conclusions In order to develop the best source of evidence, there is a need to undertake randomised controlled trials of interventions for preventing and managing advanced liver disease in adults and children with cystic fibrosis. Plain language summary Interventions for managing advanced liver disease in cystic fibrosis Review question We aimed to find the best evidence about preventing and managing advanced liver disease in adults and children with cystic fibrosis by comparing different treatment options. Background In advanced liver disease in cystic fibrosis, the normal liver tissue is replaced by scar tissue. As the disease progresses, the liver becomes hard and the blood cannot easily flow through the organ leading to increased pressure in an important blood vessel in the liver called the portal vein (portal hypertension). Later on, the veins around the lower part of the oesophagus (gullet) become swollen and torn, resulting in life‐threatening bleeding (variceal bleeding). There are several treatments currently available for variceal bleeding and portal hypertension; drug treatments (non‐selective beta blockers), endoscopic therapy (e.g. band ligation where tiny elastic bands are placed around the enlarged veins to tie them off so they can't bleed), or sclerotherapy (where a blood‐clotting solution is injected directly into a vein and irritates the lining of the blood vessel so it swells and sticks together). The insertion of a transjugular intrahepatic porto‐systemic shunt (also known as TIPSS) (an artificial channel within the liver that allows movement between the inflowing and out flowing veins) has been employed in recurrent bleeding or as a bridge to liver transplantation. Surgical porto‐systemic shunts have also been used in selected patients with preserved liver function. Liver transplantation is performed in cystic fibrosis patients with decompensated cirrhosis or end‐stage liver disease. Guidelines for screening and managing portal hypertension have been available for the general population (without cystic fibrosis). However, the optimal treatment for advanced liver disease in cystic fibrosis has not yet been defined, leading to a wide variety of practice among different centres. This is an updated version of a previously published review. Search date The evidence is current to: 19 November 2019. Study characteristics We searched for high quality trials comparing the treatments described above in children and adults with advanced liver disease in cystic fibrosis. Unfortunately, we did not find any trials to include in this review. Key results Since we did not find any trials for this review, it is not possible to make any specific recommendations or to develop best‐practice guidelines at this stage. Our review highlighted a clear need for randomised controlled trials of treatments for the prevention and management of advanced liver disease in adults and children with cystic fibrosis.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adult; Child; Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator [genetics]; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications, genetics]; Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage [prevention & control]; Humans; Hypertension, Portal [prevention & control]; Liver Diseases [etiology, prevention & control, *therapy]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD012056.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012056.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Physical therapy may help in some consequences of these postural abnormalities, such as pain, trunk deformity and quality of life. Objectives To determine the effects of a range of physical therapies for managing postural abnormalities in people with cystic fibrosis, specifically on quality of life, pain and trunk deformity. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches, hand‐searched journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Additional searches were conducted on ClinicalTrials.gov and on the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for any planned, ongoing and unpublished studies. Date of the last search: 19 March 2020. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials examining any modality of physical therapy considered relevant for treating postural disorders compared with each other, no physical therapy, sham treatment or usual care in people with CF (of any age or disease severity). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected eligible trials, assessed the risk of bias in each trial and extracted the data. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing or additional information. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE criteria. Main results Two trials, involving a total of 50 participants with CF and postural abnormalities, were included in this review. One was in people with stable disease (lasting three months) and one in hospital inpatients experiencing an exacerbation (20 days). Both trials compared manual therapy comprising mobilizations to the rib cage and thoracic spine, treatment of specific muscle dysfunction or tight muscle groups; and postural awareness and education versus medical usual care. The age of participants ranged from 17 years to 58 years. Both trials were conducted in the UK. The following outcomes were measured: change in quality of life, change in pain, change in trunk deformity and change in pulmonary function. Manual therapy may make little or no difference to the change in trunk deformity compared to usual care (low‐quality evidence). No results could be analysed for quality of life (very low‐quality evidence) and pain outcomes (very low‐quality evidence) because of the high heterogeneity between trials. It is uncertain whether the intervention improves lung function: forced vital capacity (very low‐quality evidence); forced expiratory volume in one second (very low‐quality evidence); or Tiffeneau’s index (ratio of forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC)). Only one trial (15 participants) measured functional capacity, and the change in walked distance seemed to favour intervention over usual care, but with the possibility of no effect due to wide confidence intervals. The same trial also reported that six participants in the intervention group had positive comments about the intervention and no adverse events were mentioned. Authors' conclusions Due to methodological limitations in the included trials, and in addition to the very low to low quality of the current evidence, there is limited evidence about the benefits of physical therapies on postural abnormalities in people with CF. Therefore, further well‐conducted trials with robust methodologies are required considering a prior inclusion criterion to identify the participants who have postural abnormalities. Plain language summary Physical therapies for postural abnormalities in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effects of physical therapies that can help the postural abnormalities in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease that causes problems in some organs of the body, especially in the lungs. Recently, it has been noticed that postural abnormalities may happen because of the disease progression. Some physical therapies that promote the stretching and strengthening of the muscles connected to the spine may help improving the pain and quality of life in people with cystic fibrosis. Search date The evidence is current to: 19 March 2020. Study characteristics We included two trials in this review with 50 participants aged between 17 and 58 years and diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and postural abnormalities. The trials compared manual therapy (all physical therapies that promote relaxation of the muscles, as well as mobilization of the spine, such as massage, spinal mobilization) with usual care (the normal treatment they used to receive). Participants were placed in each treatment group at random. One trial was in hospital inpatients and lasted 20 days and the second was in outpatients and lasted three months. Most of the outcomes were reported in both trials. Key results The trials did not find any difference between manual therapy and usual care for changes in trunk deformity. We could not combine results for quality of life or pain scores because they were too different. We were not able to find a difference between manual therapy and usual care for lung function. Only one trial (15 participants) measured the change in walked distance which seemed to favour manual therapy over usual care, but this was not clear because there were a large range of results. One trial reported that participants from the manual therapy group enjoyed the type of the treatment they received and that adherence was also high. None of the trials reported any side effects. Quality of the evidence Overall, there was only low‐ to very low‐quality of evidence in all outcomes considered. Low‐quality evidence means that our confidence in the effect of manual therapy is limited and the true effect may be very different. We think the fact that people knew which treatment they were receiving can affect the results for the change in quality of life, change in pain and change in lung function outcomes, but this may not affect the other outcomes. Therefore, we are still not confident that manual therapies improve outcomes that we consider important for the treatment of postural abnormalities.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Pain Management; *Physical Therapy Modalities; *Quality of Life; Cystic Fibrosis [*physiopathology]; Humans; Posture; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD013018.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013018.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD013767.PUB2","Foong, WC; Loh, CK; Ho, JJ; Lau, DSC","Foetal haemoglobin inducers for reducing blood transfusion in non‐transfusion‐dependent beta‐thalassaemias","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2023","Abstract - Background Non‐transfusion‐dependent β‐thalassaemia (NTDβT) is a subset of inherited haemoglobin disorders characterised by reduced production of the β‐globin chain of haemoglobin leading to anaemia of varying severity. Although blood transfusion is not a necessity for survival, it may be required to prevent complications of chronic anaemia, such as impaired growth and hypercoagulability. People with NTDβT also experience iron overload due to increased iron absorption from food sources which becomes more pronounced in those requiring blood transfusion. People with a higher foetal haemoglobin (HbF) level have been found to require fewer blood transfusions, thus leading to the emergence of treatments that could increase its level. HbF inducers stimulate HbF production without altering any gene structures. Evidence for the possible benefits and harms of these inducers is important for making an informed decision on their use. Objectives To compare the effectiveness and safety of the following for reducing blood transfusion for people with NTDβT: 1. HbF inducers versus usual care or placebo; 2. single HbF inducer with another HbF inducer, and single dose with another dose; and 3. combination of HbF inducers versus usual care or placebo, or single HbF inducer. Search methods We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 21 August 2022. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs comparing single HbF inducer with placebo or usual care, with another single HbF inducer or with a combination of HbF inducers; or comparing different doses of the same HbF inducer. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were blood transfusion and haemoglobin levels. Our secondary outcomes were HbF levels, the long‐term sequelae of NTDβT, quality of life and adverse events. Main results We included seven RCTs involving 291 people with NTDβT, aged two to 49 years, from five countries. We reported 10 comparisons using eight different HbF inducers (four pharmacological and four natural): three RCTs compared a single HbF inducer to placebo and seven to another HbF inducer. The duration of the intervention lasted from 56 days to six months. Most studies did not adequately report the randomisation procedures or whether and how blinding was achieved. HbF inducer against placebo or usual care Three HbF inducers, HQK‐1001, Radix Astragali or a 3‐in‐1 combined natural preparation (CNP), were compared with a placebo. None of the comparisons reported the frequency of blood transfusion. We are uncertain whether Radix Astragali and CNP increase haemoglobin at three months (mean difference (MD) 1.33 g/dL, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 2.11; 1 study, 2 interventions, 35 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether Radix Astragali and CNP have any effect on HbF (MD 12%, 95% CI −0.74% to 24.75%; 1 study, 2 interventions, 35 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Only medians on haemoglobin and HbF levels were reported for HQK‐1001. Adverse effects reported for HQK‐1001 were nausea, vomiting, dizziness and suprapubic pain. There were no prespecified adverse effects for Radix Astragali and CNP. HbF inducer versus another HbF inducer Four studies compared a single inducer with another over three to six months. Comparisons included hydroxyurea versus resveratrol, hydroxyurea versus thalidomide, hydroxyurea versus decitabine and Radix Astragali versus CNP. No study reported our prespecified outcomes on blood transfusion. Haemoglobin and HbF were reported for the comparison Radix Astragali versus CNP, but we are uncertain whether there were any differences (1 study, 24 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Different doses of the same HbF inducer Two studies compared two different types of HbF inducers at different doses over two to six months. Comparisons included hydroxyurea 20 mg/kg/day versus 10 mg/kg/day and HQK‐1001 10 mg/kg/day, 20 mg/kg/day, 30 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day. Blood transfusion, as prespecified, was not reported. In one study (61 participants) we are uncertain whether the lower levels of both haemoglobin and HbF at 24 weeks were due to the higher dose of hydroxyurea (haemoglobin: MD −2.39 g/dL, 95% CI −2.80 to −1.98; very low‐certainty evidence; HbF: MD −10.20%, 95% CI −16.28% to −4.12%; very low‐certainty evidence). The study of the four different doses of HQK‐1001 did not report results for either haemoglobin or HbF. We are not certain if major adverse effects may be more common with higher hydroxyurea doses (neutropenia: risk ratio (RR) 9.93, 95% CI 1.34 to 73.97; thrombocytopenia: RR 3.68, 95% CI 1.12 to 12.07; very low‐certainty evidence). Taking HQK‐1001 20 mg/kg/day may result in the fewest adverse effects. A combination of HbF inducers versus a single HbF inducer Two studies compared three combinations of two inducers with a single inducer over six months: hydroxyurea plus resveratrol versus resveratrol or hydroxyurea alone, and hydroxyurea plus l‐carnitine versus hydroxyurea alone. Blood transfusion was not reported. Hydroxyurea plus resveratrol may reduce haemoglobin compared with either resveratrol or hydroxyurea alone (MD −0.74 g/dL, 95% CI −1.45 to −0.03; 1 study, 54 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We are not certain whether the gastrointestinal disturbances, headache and malaise more commonly reported with hydroxyurea plus resveratrol than resveratrol alone were due to the interventions. We are uncertain whether hydroxyurea plus l‐carnitine compared with hydroxyurea alone may increase mean haemoglobin, and reduce pulmonary hypertension (1 study, 60 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Adverse events were reported but not in the intervention group. None of the comparisons reported the outcome of HbF. Authors' conclusions We are uncertain whether any of the eight HbF inducers in this review have a beneficial effect on people with NTDβT. For each of these HbF inducers, we found only one or at the most two small studies. There is no information on whether any of these HbF inducers have an effect on our primary outcome, blood transfusion. For the second primary outcome, haemoglobin, there may be small differences between intervention groups, but these may not be clinically meaningful and are of low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence. Data on adverse effects and optimal doses are limited. Five studies are awaiting classification, but none are ongoing. Plain language summary Medicines to increase foetal haemoglobin levels and reduce the need for blood transfusion in people with non‐transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia Review question Do medicines that increase foetal haemoglobin (HbF) levels in people with non‐transfusion‐dependent β‐thalassaemia (NTDβT) reduce their need for blood transfusion? What is thalassaemia? Thalassaemia is a genetic (inherited) blood disorder that causes defects in adult haemoglobin (the oxygen carrying component of red blood cells) leading to destruction of the red blood cells and anaemia with different degrees of severity. Persistent anaemia can affect general health and reduce quality of life. People with NTDβT may require periodic blood transfusion to replace the red blood cells and this could lead to excess iron being deposited in various organs in the body, affecting their function. People with NTDβT have higher levels of HbF (the main form of haemoglobin found during the development of a baby before birth) which persists after birth. The amount of HbF that persists varies and people with a higher HbF level require less frequent blood transfusions. What are HbF inducers? HbF inducers are substances which increase HbF levels without alteration to the gene. They may reduce the need for blood transfusion in people with NTDβT. However, it is not known which HbF inducers are effective and safe, and if so, what the optimal dose is and at what age treatment should be started. What did we do? We searched medical databases for studies comparing single HbF inducer with placebo (dummy treatment) or usual care, with another inducer or with a combination of inducers; or comparing different doses for a same inducer. What did we find? We found seven very small randomised controlled trials (where people taking part in the trial had equal chances of being in the treatment or the control group), involving 291 people with NTDβT, aged between two and 49 years, from five countries. These studies varied widely in the type of HbF inducers investigated and their comparison, the doses and how outcomes were reported. The duration of the trials ranged from two to six months. The inducers used include hydroxyurea, decitabine, HQK‐1001, thalidomide, Radix Astragali, resveratrol, l‐carnitine and combined natural preparation (CNP). Main results None of the studies reported our main outcome of changes to the frequency of blood transfusion. All inducers may have caused a small increase in haemoglobin and HbF when compared to placebo, but we are very uncertain about this. Four studies compared a single HbF inducer against another, for three to six months. There were changes to haemoglobin and HbF, but we cannot be certain if a single HbF inducer or a combination of HbF inducers would work better than another. Two studies, each compared a different dose of the same inducer. Lower doses of hydroxyurea appeared to increase haemoglobin and HbF levels more than the higher doses, but we are very uncertain. The other study used four different doses of HQK‐1001 but did not actually look for a difference in the effect of these four different doses on haemoglobin or HbF. Two studies compared a combination of two HbF inducers with a single HbF inducer for six months. We are very uncertain whether the combination or a single inducer improves haemoglobin. None of the studies reported whether HbF inducers have any effect on quality of life. Adverse (unwanted) drug effects were reported for each HbF inducer, but there was little information available to guide us on the safety of these substances. What are the limitations of the evidence? The main reason we are very uncertain about the effects of HbF inducers are because the studies were all very small and had weaknesses in their design. None of the studies lasted long enough to provide meaningful information for many of the outcomes we measured. How up to date is this evidence? The evidence is current to 21 August 2022.","1","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*beta-Thalassemia [therapy]; Blood Transfusion; Fetal Hemoglobin; Humans; Hydroxyurea; Resveratrol","10.1002/14651858.CD013767.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013767.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD013766.PUB2","Dawson, S; Girling, C-J; Cowap, L; Clark-Carter, D","Psychological interventions for improving adherence to inhaled therapies in people with cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2023","Abstract - Background Adherence to treatment, including inhaled therapies, is low in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Although psychological interventions for improving adherence to inhaled therapies in people with CF have been developed, no previous published systematic review has evaluated the evidence for efficacy of these interventions. Objectives The primary objective of the review was to assess the efficacy of psychological interventions for improving adherence to inhaled therapies in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). The secondary objective was to establish the most effective components, or behaviour change techniques (BCTs), used in these interventions. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, which is compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched databases (PubMed; PsycINFO; EBSCO; Scopus; OpenGrey), trials registries (World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov), and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews, with no restrictions on language, year or publication status. Date of search: 7 August 2022. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different types of psychological interventions for improving adherence to inhaled therapies in people with CF of any age, or comparing psychological interventions with usual care. We included quasi‐RCTs if we could reasonably assume that the baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and completed data extraction, risk of bias assessments, and BCT coding (using the BCT Taxonomy v1) for all included trials. We resolved any discrepancies by discussion, or by consultation with a third review author as necessary. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Main results We included 10 trials (1642 participants) in the review (children and adolescents in four trials; adults in five trials; and children and adults in one trial). Nine trials compared a psychological intervention with usual care; we could combine data from some of these in a number of quantitative analyses. One trial compared a psychological intervention with an active comparator (education plus problem‐solving (EPS)). We identified five ongoing trials. Psychological interventions were generally multi‐component and complex, containing an average of 9.6 BCTs (range 1 to 28). The two most commonly used BCTs included 'problem‐solving' and 'instruction on how to perform the behaviour'. Interventions varied in their type, content and mode of delivery. They included a problem‐solving intervention; a paper‐based self‐management workbook; a telehealth intervention; a group training programme; a digital intervention comprising medication reminders and lung function self‐monitoring; a life‐coaching intervention; a motivational interviewing (MI) intervention; a brief MI intervention (behaviour change counselling); and a digital intervention combined with behaviour change sessions. Intervention duration ranged from 10 weeks to 12 months. Assessment time points ranged from six to eight weeks up to 23 months. Psychological interventions compared with usual care We report data here for the 'over six months and up to 12 months' time point. We found that psychological interventions probably improve adherence to inhaled therapies (primary outcome) in people with CF compared with usual care (mean difference (MD) 9.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 8.60 to 10.40; 1 study, 588 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between groups in our second primary outcome, treatment‐related adverse events: anxiety (MD 0.30, 95% CI ‐0.40 to 1.00; 1 study, 535 participants), or depression (MD ‐0.10, 95% CI ‐0.80 to 0.60; 1 study, 534 participants), although this was low‐certainty evidence. For our secondary outcomes, there was no evidence of a difference between groups in terms of lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) % predicted MD 1.40, 95% CI ‐0.20 to 3.00; 1 study, 556 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); number of pulmonary exacerbations (adjusted rate ratio 0.96, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.11; 1 study, 607 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); or respiratory symptoms (MD 0.70, 95% CI ‐2.40 to 3.80; 1 study, 534 participants; low‐certainty evidence). However, psychological interventions may improve treatment burden (MD 3.90, 95% CI 1.20 to 6.60; 1 study, 539 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The overall certainty of the evidence ranged from low to moderate across these outcomes. Reasons for downgrading included indirectness (current evidence included adults only whereas our review question was broader and focused on people of any age) and lack of blinding of outcome assessors. Psychological interventions compared with an active comparator For this comparison the overall certainty of evidence was very low, based on one trial (n = 128) comparing an MI intervention to EPS for 12 months. We are uncertain whether an MI intervention, compared with EPS, improves adherence to inhaled therapies, lung function, or quality of life in people with CF, or whether there is an effect on pulmonary exacerbations. The included trial for this comparison did not report on treatment‐related adverse events (anxiety and depression). We downgraded all reported outcomes due to small participant numbers, indirectness (trials included only adults), and unclear risk of bias (e.g. selection and attrition bias). Authors' conclusions Due to the limited quantity of trials included in this review, as well as the clinical and methodological heterogeneity, it was not possible to identify an overall intervention effect using meta‐analysis. Some moderate‐certainty evidence suggests that psychological interventions (compared with usual care) probably improve adherence to inhaled therapies in people with CF, without increasing treatment‐related adverse events, anxiety and depression (low‐certainty evidence). In future review updates (with ongoing trial results included), we hope to be able to establish the most effective BCTs (or 'active ingredients') of interventions for improving adherence to inhaled therapies in people with CF. Wherever possible, investigators should make use of the most objective measures of adherence available (e.g. data‐logging nebulisers) to accurately determine intervention effects. Outcome reporting needs to be improved to enable combining or separation of measures as appropriate. Likewise, trial reporting needs to include details of intervention content (e.g. BCTs used); duration; intensity; and fidelity. Large trials with a longer follow‐up period (e.g. 12 months) are needed in children with CF. Additionally, more research is needed to determine how to support adherence in 'under‐served' CF populations. Plain language summary Psychological interventions to help people with cystic fibrosis take their inhaled treatments Key messages Psychological interventions are designed to help people modify their thoughts, feelings and behaviours. We think that psychological interventions are probably better than usual care at helping people with CF to take their inhaled treatments, and may cause little or no harm (e.g. anxiety or depression) when measured six to 12 months after treatment. We are uncertain whether motivational interviewing (MI) was better or worse than education plus problem‐solving (EPS) at helping people with CF to take their inhaled treatments. Background CF is a chronic, genetic condition, usually diagnosed at birth through newborn screening. People with CF experience recurrent chest infections due to the build‐up of thick, sticky mucus (or sputum) in their lungs and digestive systems. Inhaled treatments are usually prescribed to either thin sputum (making it easier to clear or cough up), or to treat and control bacteria in the lungs (to reduce infections). People living with any long‐term health condition often struggle to take the number of treatments they are prescribed, and this is no different in CF. What did we want to find out? Can psychological interventions help people with CF to take their inhaled treatments, and are there any harmful or unwanted effects of these interventions (e.g. anxiety or depression)? Which techniques (e.g. goal‐setting, problem‐solving) work best at helping people with CF to take their inhaled treatments? What did we do? We searched for studies comparing different types of psychological interventions, or comparing the interventions with usual care, for helping people with CF of any age to take their inhaled treatments. We compared and summarised the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as the trial methods. What did we find? We included 10 trials with 1642 people with CF (approximately 54.3% female). Four trials included children and adolescents; five trials included adults; and one trial included both. Nine trials compared a psychological intervention with usual care, and one study compared two psychological interventions (MI versus EPS). People (or in one trial, CF centres) were randomly selected for one group or the other. People were followed up for between six to eight weeks and 23 months. Psychological interventions were wide‐ranging. They included an intervention that combined digital technology (website or app) with support from trained healthcare professionals. Interventions used a range of techniques, with problem‐solving and providing instructions on how to take treatments being the most commonly used. Main results Psychological interventions are probably better than usual care at helping people with CF to take their inhaled treatments, and may cause little or no harm (e.g. anxiety or depression) when measured six to 12 months after treatment. Psychological interventions may also improve perceived treatment burden (as measured using a quality of life (QoL) questionnaire). There was no evidence of a difference between groups in terms of lung function (a measure of how well someone's lungs are working), the number of chest infections, or perceived chest symptoms (again measured using a QoL questionnaire). We are uncertain whether MI was better or worse than EPS at helping people with CF to take their inhaled treatments, improving lung function or QoL, or reducing chest infections in people with CF. The included trial did not look at whether MI or EPS caused harm (e.g. anxiety or depression). What are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in the evidence for psychological interventions being better or worse than usual care ranges from low to moderate. The biggest included trial of psychological interventions (which had results from between six and 12 months after treatment started) focused on adults with CF (aged 16 years and over), whereas the question we wanted to answer was broader (i.e. we cannot be sure if the results would be the same in children). Large trials with a longer follow‐up period (e.g. 12 months) are needed in children with CF. It is possible that because people completing the outcome assessments knew which group they were in, this might affect the results for QoL, anxiety and depression. We are not confident in the evidence comparing MI with EPS. The only trial examining this included a small number of adults, so we cannot be sure if the results would be the same in children or in a larger group of people. We are unsure whether participants were put into the different treatment groups truly at random, so differences between the groups might be due to differences between people rather than the treatments. We are also unsure about people leaving the trial early and how this might affect the results. We also think that because the people completing the outcome assessments knew which group they were in, this might affect the QoL results. Current evidence on which techniques (e.g. goal‐setting, problem‐solving) work best at helping people with CF to take their inhaled treatments is limited. Future trials should provide more details on the techniques used in interventions. How up to date is this evidence? The evidence is up to date to 7 August 2022.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; *Cystic Fibrosis [complications, drug therapy]; Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety Disorders; Anxiety [therapy]; Child; Humans; Psychosocial Intervention; Quality of Life","10.1002/14651858.CD013766.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013766.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Several medical interventions are available for treating chronic rhinosinusitis in people with cystic fibrosis; for example, different concentrations of nasal saline irrigations, topical or oral corticosteroids, antibiotics ‐ including nebulized antibiotics ‐ dornase alfa and modulators of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (such as lumacaftor, ivacaftor or tezacaftor). However, the efficacy of these interventions is unclear. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives The objective of this review is to compare the effects of different medical interventions in people diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and chronic rhinosinusitis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and hand searching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of last search of trials register: 09 September 2021. We also searched ongoing trials databases, other medical databases and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of latest additional searches: 22 November 2021. Selection criteria Randomized and quasi‐randomized trials of different medical interventions compared to each other or to no intervention or to placebo. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials identified for potential inclusion in the review. We planned to conduct data collection and analysis in accordance with Cochrane methods and to independently rate the quality of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE guidelines. Main results We identified no trials that met the pre‐defined inclusion criteria. The most recent searches identified 44 new references, none of which were eligible for inclusion in the current version of this review; 12 studies are listed as excluded and one as ongoing. Authors' conclusions We identified no eligible trials assessing the medical interventions in people with cystic fibrosis and chronic rhinosinusitis. High‐quality trials are needed which should assess the efficacy of different treatment options detailed above for managing chronic rhinosinusitis, preventing pulmonary exacerbations and improving quality of life in people with cystic fibrosis. Plain language summary Medical interventions for chronic inflammation of the nose and sinuses in cystic fibrosis Review question What are the effects of medical interventions for chronic rhinosinusitis on people with cystic fibrosis? Background Chronic rhinosinusitis is long‐term infection and inflammation of the nasal cavity and air‐filled spaces around the eyes and nose. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition that makes secretions in the body thick, and hence stagnant. When this occurs in and around the nose, it causes chronic rhinosinusitis. Better care of people with cystic fibrosis has led to them living longer, increasing the chance of developing chronic rhinosinusitis. Early and effective interventions with antibiotics, steroids, drugs that thin the mucus (e.g. dornase alfa) and drugs to improve how the cell membrane channel functions (CFTR modulators) can help to improve quality of life and prevent the development of lower airway disease. Currently, there are no guidelines based on trials to know how best to treat chronic rhinosinusitis in people with cystic fibrosis. Search date The evidence is current to: 09 September 2021. Study characteristics We found no trials in our search that met our inclusion criteria. We have listed 12 trials as excluded and one trial as ongoing in the current review. Key results Although chronic rhinosinusitis is common in people with cystic fibrosis, there is not enough evidence available on its management. This review highlights the need for well‐designed trials assessing which treatment is best for managing chronic rhinosinusitis, preventing lower airway disease and improving quality of life in people with cystic fibrosis.","4","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Cystic Fibrosis [drug therapy, therapy]; *Sinusitis [complications, drug therapy]; Anti-Bacterial Agents [therapeutic use]; Chronic Disease; Humans; Quality of Life","10.1002/14651858.CD012979.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012979.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Early studies reported colchicine may potentially prevent FMF attacks. For people who are colchicine‐resistant or intolerant, drugs such as anakinra, rilonacept, canakinumab, etanercept, infliximab or adalimumab might be beneficial. This is an update of the review last published in 2018. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of interventions for reducing inflammation in people with FMF. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and four Chinese databases on in August 2021. We searched clinical trials registries and references listed in relevant reports. The last search was 17 August 2021. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of people with FMF, comparing active interventions (including colchicine, anakinra, rilonacept, canakinumab, etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, thalidomide, tocilizumab, interferon‐α and ImmunoGuard (herbal dietary supplement)) with placebo or no treatment, or comparing active drugs to each other. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methodology. We assessed certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Main results We included 10 RCTs with 312 participants (aged three to 53 years), including five parallel and five cross‐over designed studies. Six studies used oral colchicine, one used oral ImmunoGuard, and the remaining three used rilonacept, anakinra or canakinumab as a subcutaneous injection. The duration of each study arm ranged from one to eight months. There were inadequacies in the design of the four older colchicine studies and the two studies comparing a single to a divided dose of colchicine. However, the four studies of ImmunoGuard, rilonacept, anakinra and canakinumab were generally well‐designed.  We aimed to report on the number of participants experiencing an attack, the timing of attacks, the prevention of amyloid A amyloidosis, adverse drug reactions and the response of a number of biochemical markers from the acute phase of an attack; but no study reported on the prevention of amyloid A amyloidosis. Colchicine (oral) versus placebo After three months, colchicine 0.6 mg three times daily may reduce the number of people experiencing attacks (risk ratio (RR) 0.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.95; 1 study, 10 participants; low‐certainty evidence). One study (20 participants) of colchicine 0.5 mg twice daily showed there may be no difference in the number of participants experiencing attacks at two months (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.23; low‐certainty evidence). There may be no differences in the duration of attacks (narrative summary; very low‐certainty evidence), or in the number of days between attacks: (narrative summary; very low‐certainty evidence). Regarding adverse drug reactions, one study reported loose stools and frequent bowel movements and a second reported diarrhea (narrative summary; both very low‐certainty evidence). There were no data on acute‐phase response. Rilonacept versus placebo There is probably no difference in the number of people experiencing attacks at three months (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.26; moderate‐certainty evidence).  There may be no differences in the duration of attacks (narrative summary; low‐certainty evidence) or in the number of days between attacks (narrative summary; low‐certainty evidence). Regarding adverse drug reactions, the rilonacept study reported there may be no differences in gastrointestinal symptoms, hypertension, headache, respiratory tract infections, injection site reactions and herpes, compared to placebo (narrative summary; low‐certainty evidence). The study narratively reported there may be no differences in acute‐phase response indicators after three months (low‐certainty evidence). ImmunoGuard versus placebo The ImmunoGuard study observed there are probably no differences in adverse effects (moderate‐certainty evidence) or in acute‐phase response indicators after one month of treatment (moderate‐certainty evidence). No data were reported for the number of people experiencing an attack, duration of attacks or days between attacks. Anakinra versus placebo A study of anakinra given to 25 colchicine‐resistant participants found there is probably no difference in the number of participants experiencing an attack at four months (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.07; moderate‐certainty evidence).  There were no data for duration of attacks or days between attacks. There are probably no differences between anakinra and placebo with regards to injection site reaction, headache, presyncope, dyspnea and itching (narrative summary; moderate‐certainty evidence). For acute‐phase response, anakinra probably reduced C‐reactive protein (CRP) after four months (narrative summary; moderate‐certainty evidence). Canakinumab versus placebo Canakinumab probably reduces the number of participants experiencing an attack at 16 weeks (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.65; 1 study, 63 colchicine‐resistant participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no data for the duration of attacks or days between attacks. The included study reported the number of serious adverse events per 100 patient‐years was probably 42.7 with canakinumab versus 97.4 with placebo among people with colchicine‐resistant FMF (moderate‐certainty evidence). For acute‐phase response, canakinumab probably caused a higher proportion of participants to have a CRP level of 10 mg/L or less compared to placebo (68% with canakinumab versus 6% with placebo; 1 study, 63 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Colchicine single dose versus divided dose There is probably no difference in the duration of attacks at three months (MD −0.04 hours, 95% CI −10.91 to 10.83) or six months (MD 2.80 hours, 95% CI −5.39 to 10.99; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no data for the number of participants experiencing an attack or days between attacks. There is probably no difference in adverse events (including anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting and elevated liver enzymes) between groups (narrative summary; moderate‐certainty evidence). For acute‐phase response, there may be no evidence of a difference between groups (narrative summary; low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions There were limited RCTs assessing interventions for people with FMF. Based on the evidence, three times daily colchicine may reduce the number of people experiencing attacks, colchicine single dose and divided dose may not be different for children with FMF, canakinumab probably reduces the number of people experiencing attacks, and anakinra or canakinumab probably reduce CRP in colchicine‐resistant participants; however, only a few RCTs contributed data for analysis. Further RCTs examining active interventions, not only colchicine, are necessary before a comprehensive conclusion regarding the efficacy and safety of interventions for reducing inflammation in FMF can be drawn. Plain language summary Medicines for reducing inflammation in people with familial Mediterranean fever Review question Can treatments such as colchicine, anakinra, rilonacept, canakinumab, etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, thalidomide, tocilizumab, interferon‐α and ImmunoGuard (a herbal supplement)) reduce inflammation in people with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF)? Background FMF is a hereditary inflammatory disease, with symptoms of an attack often including fever over 38 °C, pain and inflammation of the membrane surrounding the chest cavity, the joints or the lungs. We wanted to discover whether these medicines were better for reducing inflammation for people with FMF than placebo (a dummy treatment containing no active medicine) or no treatment, and also to compare these medicines with each other. Search date The evidence is current to 17 August 2021. Study characteristics The review included 10 studies with 312 people with FMF aged between three and 53 years. Eight studies compared five medicines, colchicine, rilonacept, ImmunoGuard, anakinra and canakinumab, with placebo. Participants received one medicine or placebo at random over one to four months. The remaining two studies compared colchicine 1 mg per day once daily with colchicine two or three times daily in children for six to eight months. Key results We aimed to report on the number of participants experiencing an attack, the timing of attacks, prevention of amyloid A amyloidosis (which is a reaction to a chronic inflammatory disease or infection leading to a build‐up of an abnormal protein called amyloid in organs and tissues throughout the body stopping them working properly), and any side effects of treatment and the levels of a number of markers of inflammation during an attack. Not all studies reported these outcomes. Given the differences in treatments and study design, it was not possible to combine any of the results that we did obtain from these studies.  One study (15 participants) with oral colchicine 0.6 mg three times a day and another study (63 participants) with subcutaneous (under the skin) canakinumab 150 mg every four weeks for 16 weeks may help to reduce the numbers of people with attacks of FMF. However, oral colchicine 0.5 mg twice a day (20 participants), rilonacept (14 participants) or anakinra (25 participants) did not reduce the numbers of people with attacks. ImmunoGuard (24 participants) did not reduce levels of the markers of inflammation in the blood which are raised during the attack phase of FMF; these include the rate of fall of red blood cells when placed in a test tube, the white blood cell count and the presence of C‐reactive protein (a protein that is produced in the liver). Anakinra and canakinumab reduced C‐reactive protein levels. Colchicine taken once daily and two or three times daily might not result in different outcomes including the timing of attacks, sider effects of the medicine and acute‐phase response indicators. Quality of the evidence Four studies were well‐designed, while the others had some design problems that might have affected the results. Four studies did not report clearly how the people were assigned to each treatment group. Four studies did not report whether researchers, who assessed the study outcomes, knew which individuals were assigned to which treatment. Four studies did not clearly explain the reasons for people withdrawing from a study and one study had a high percentage of participants who did not complete study. We could not confirm whether each planned outcome was reported in five studies. Five studies did not report the severity of FMF in groups at the beginning of treatment. We judged the evidence for the reported outcomes to be of moderate to very low quality.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Familial Mediterranean Fever [chemically induced, drug therapy]; Adolescent; Adult; Amyloidosis; Child; Child, Preschool; Colchicine [adverse effects]; Humans; Inflammation; Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein [adverse effects]; Middle Aged; Serum Amyloid A Protein [adverse effects]; Young Adult","10.1002/14651858.CD010893.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010893.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD013285.PUB2","Heinz, KD; Walsh, A; Southern, KW; Johnstone, Z; Regan, KH","Exercise versus airway clearance techniques for people with cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2022","Abstract - Background There are many accepted airway clearance techniques (ACTs) for managing the respiratory health of people with cystic fibrosis (CF); none of which demonstrate superiority. Other Cochrane Reviews have reported short‐term effects related to mucus transport, but no evidence supporting long‐term benefits. Exercise is an alternative ACT thought to produce shearing forces within the lung parenchyma, which enhances mucociliary clearance and the removal of viscous secretions. Recent evidence suggests that some people with CF are using exercise as a substitute for traditional ACTs, yet there is no agreed recommendation for this. Additionally, one of the top 10 research questions identified by people with CF is whether exercise can replace other ACTs. Systematically reviewing the evidence for exercise as a safe and effective ACT will help people with CF decide whether to incorporate this strategy into their treatment plans and potentially reduce their treatment burden. The timing of this review is especially pertinent given the shifting landscape of CF management with the advent of highly‐effective small molecule therapies, which are changing the way people with CF are cared for. Objectives To compare the effect of exercise to other ACTs for improving respiratory function and other clinical outcomes in people with CF and to assess the potential adverse effects associated with this ACT. Search methods On 28 February 2022, we searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. We searched online clinical trial registries on 15 February 2022. We emailed authors of studies awaiting classification or potentially eligible abstracts for additional information on 1 February 2021. Selection criteria We selected randomised controlled studies (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing exercise to another ACT in people with CF for at least two treatment sessions. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias for the included studies. They assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Review authors contacted investigators for further relevant information regarding their publications. Main results We included four RCTs. The 86 participants had a wide range of disease severity (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) ranged from 54% to 95%) and were 7 to 41 years old. Two RCTs were cross‐over and two were parallel in design. Participants in one RCT were hospitalised with an acute respiratory exacerbation, whilst the participants in three RCTs were clinically stable. All four RCTs compared exercise either alone or in combination with another ACT, but these were too diverse to allow us to combine results. The certainty of the evidence was very low; we downgraded it due to low participant numbers and high or unclear risks of bias across all domains. Exercise versus active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) One cross‐over trial (18 participants) compared exercise alone to ACBT. There was no change from baseline in our primary outcome FEV 1 , although it increased in the exercise group before returning to baseline after 30 minutes; we are unsure if exercise affected FEV 1  as the evidence is very low‐certainty. Similar results were seen for other measures of lung function. No adverse events occurred during the exercise sessions (very low‐certainty evidence). We are unsure if ACBT was perceived to be more effective or was the preferred ACT (very low‐certainty evidence). 24‐hour sputum volume was less in the exercise group than with ACBT (secondary outcome). Exercise capacity, quality of life, adherence, hospitalisations and need for additional antibiotics were not reported. Exercise plus postural drainage and percussion (PD&P) versus PD&P only Two trials (55 participants) compared exercise and PD&P to PD&P alone. At two weeks, one trial narratively reported a greater increase in FEV 1  % predicted with PD&P alone. At six months, the other trial reported a greater increase with exercise combined with PD&P, but did not provide data for the PD&P group. We are uncertain whether exercise with PD&P improves FEV 1  as the certainty of evidence is very low. Other measures of lung function did not show clear evidence of effect. One trial reported no difference in exercise capacity (maximal work rate) after two weeks. No adverse events were reported (1 trial, 17 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Adherence was high, with all PD&P sessions and 96% of exercise sessions completed (1 trial, 17 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). There was no difference between groups in 24‐hour sputum volume or in the mean duration of hospitalisation, although the six‐month trial reported fewer hospitalisations due to exacerbations in the exercise and PD&P group. Quality of life, ACT preference and need for antibiotics were not reported. Exercise versus underwater positive expiratory pressure (uPEP) One trial (13 participants) compared exercise to uPEP (also known as bubble PEP). No adverse events were recorded in either group (very low‐certainty evidence). Trial investigators reported that participants perceived exercise as more fatiguing but also more enjoyable than bubble PEP (very low‐certainty evidence). There were no differences found in the total weight of sputum collected during treatment sessions. The trial did not report the primary outcomes (FEV 1 , quality of life, exercise capacity) or the secondary outcomes (other measures of lung function, adherence, need for antibiotics or hospitalisations). Authors' conclusions As one of the top 10 research questions identified by clinicians and people with CF, it is important to systematically review the literature regarding whether or not exercise is an acceptable and effective ACT, and whether it can replace traditional methods. We identified an insufficient number of trials to conclude whether or not exercise is a suitable alternative ACT, and the diverse design of included trials did not allow for meta‐analysis of results. The evidence is very low‐certainty, so we are uncertain about the effectiveness of exercise as an ACT. Longer studies examining outcomes that are important to people with CF are required to answer this question. Plain language summary Exercise versus airway clearance for people with cystic fibrosis Review question Can exercise replace other methods of airway clearance for people with cystic fibrosis (CF)? Background CF affects many systems in the body, mainly the respiratory system. It causes a build‐up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs which causes irritation and damage to the lining of the airways. CF treatment involves chest physiotherapy, also called airway clearance, which uses a range of devices or techniques to get rid of this mucus. It has been suggested that exercise may have a similar effect. Exercising results in a person taking different volumes and depths of breaths. This leads to pressure changes and forces within the airways that move secretions out of the lungs. We compared the effect on lung function of exercise versus other techniques, to see if exercise is a suitable alternative for people with CF. We wanted to answer our review question to potentially reduce their treatment burden. Search date The evidence is current to 15 February 2022. Study characteristics We searched the literature for studies where people received at least two treatment sessions of exercise or another airway clearance technique, and report on four studies including 86 people with CF in the review. The people in the studies were aged between 7 and 41 years and had varying degrees of disease severity. Three studies included people who were clinically well and one study included people admitted to hospital for a chest infection. The studies lasted between four days and six months and compared exercise (alone or in combination with another airway clearance technique) to other techniques. Two studies compared exercise with postural drainage and percussion (PD&P), one study compared exercise with the active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) and one study compared exercise with underwater positive expiratory pressure (uPEP), also known as bubble PEP. Three studies received financial support from funding bodies such as the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, the Buffalo Foundation and the Romanian National Council for Scientific Research in Higher Education. Key results We did not find enough evidence to conclude whether or not exercise can replace other methods of airway clearance. We did not find any evidence to suggest that exercise was either better or worse than other methods to improve lung function or clear mucus from the airways, although exercising did improve people's exercise ability, and it was the preferred choice of treatment in one study. None of the studies reported any negative effects of exercise therapy. None of the studies evaluated quality of life or the need for extra antibiotic treatment. One study did suggest that exercise alone was less effective at clearing sputum than ACBT. Exercise versus ACBT One study (18 participants) found that a measure of lung function temporarily (up to 30 minutes) increased in the exercise group only, otherwise there was no difference between the ACBT or the exercise group. No adverse events were reported, and it is not certain if ACBT was thought to be more effective or was preferred. The exercise group produced less sputum than the ACBT group. The study did not report on exercise capacity, quality of life, adherence, hospitalisations and need for additional antibiotics. Exercise plus PD&P versus PD&P alone Two studies (55 participants) compared exercise plus PD&P to PD&P alone. At two weeks, one trial described a greater increase in lung function with PD&P alone, while at six months the second study reported a greater increase with exercise plus PD&P (but did not provide data for the PD&P group). One study reported no side effects at all, and also reported no difference between groups in exercise capacity (maximal work rate), sputum volume or the average length of time spent in hospital. Conversely, the second study reported fewer hospitalisations due to exacerbations in the exercise and PD&P group. Neither study reported on quality of life, preference and the need for antibiotics. Exercise versus uPEP One study (13 participants) compared exercise to uPEP (also known as bubble PEP). No adverse events were recorded in either group and investigators reported that those taking part thought that, while exercise was more tiring, it was also more enjoyable than bubble PEP. We found no differences in the total weight of sputum collected during treatment sessions. The study did not report on lung function, quality of life, exercise capacity, adherence, need for antibiotics or hospitalisations. Certainty of the evidence Overall, we had very little confidence in the evidence because all four studies had few participants and two studies only presented results as a shortened report given at a conference.  We do not think the fact that participants and people measuring the outcomes knew which treatment the participants were receiving influenced the results of outcomes such as lung function and sputum weight. We do not think the fact that these studies were financed should influence the interpretation of the results in this review.

"CD013666.PUB2","Smith, S; Rowbotham, NJ; Edwards, CT","Short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators for cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2022","Abstract - Background Respiratory disease is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF), and many different therapies are used by people with CF in the management of respiratory problems. Bronchodilator therapy is used to relieve symptoms of shortness of breath and to open the airways to allow clearance of mucus. Despite the widespread use of inhaled bronchodilators in CF, there is little objective evidence of their efficacy. A Cochrane Review looking at both short‐ and long‐acting inhaled bronchodilators for CF was withdrawn from the Cochrane Library in 2016. That review has been replaced by two separate Cochrane Reviews: one on long‐acting inhaled bronchodilators for CF, and this review on short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators for CF. For this review 'inhaled' includes the use of pressurised metered dose inhalers (MDIs), with or without a spacer, dry powder devices and nebulisers. Objectives To evaluate short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators in children and adults with CF in terms of clinical outcomes and safety. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books on 28 March 2022 and searched trial registries for any new or ongoing trials on 12 April 2022. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Selection criteria We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs that looked at the effect of any short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator delivered by any device, at any dose, at any frequency and for any duration compared to either placebo or another short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator in people with CF. We screened references as per standard Cochrane methodology. Data collection and analysis Two review authors extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool. Where we were not able to enter data into our analyses we reported results directly from the papers. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Main results We included 11 trials from our systematic search, with 191 participants meeting our inclusion criteria; three of these trials had three treatment arms. Eight trials compared short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists to placebo and four trials compared short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists to placebo. Three trials compared short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists to short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists. All were cross‐over trials with only small numbers of participants. We were only able to enter data into the analysis from three trials comparing short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists to placebo. Short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists versus placebo All eight trials (six single‐dose trials and two longer‐term trials) reporting on this comparison reported on forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ), either as per cent predicted (% predicted) or L. We were able to combine the data from two trials in a meta‐analysis which showed a greater per cent change from baseline in FEV 1  L after beta‐2 agonists compared to placebo (mean difference (MD) 6.95%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.88 to 12.02; 2 trials, 82 participants). Only one of the longer‐term trials reported on exacerbations, as measured by hospitalisations and courses of antibiotics. Only the second longer‐term trial presented results for participant‐reported outcomes. Three trials narratively reported adverse events, and these were all mild. Three single‐dose trials and the two longer trials reported on forced vital capacity (FVC), and five trials reported on peak expiratory flow, i.e. forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% (FEF 25-75 ). One trial reported on airway clearance in terms of sputum weight. We judged the certainty of evidence for each of these outcomes to be very low, meaning we are very uncertain about the effect of short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists on any of the outcomes we assessed. Short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists versus placebo All four trials reporting on this comparison looked at the effects of ipratropium bromide, but in different doses and via different delivery methods. One trial reported FEV 1  % predicted; three trials measured this in L. Two trials reported adverse events, but these were few and mild. One trial reported FVC and three trials reported FEF 25-75 . None of the trials reported on quality of life, exacerbations or airway clearance. We judged the certainty of evidence for each of these outcomes to be very low, meaning we are very uncertain about the effect of short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists on any of the outcomes we assessed. Short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists versus short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists  None of the three single‐dose trials reporting on this comparison provided data we could analyse. The original papers from three trials report that both treatments lead to an improvement in FEV 1  L. Only one trial reported on adverse events; but none were experienced by any participant. No trial reported on any of our other outcomes. We judged the certainty of evidence to be very low, meaning we are very uncertain about the effect of short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists compared to short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists on any of the outcomes we assessed. Authors' conclusions All included trials in this review are small and of a cross‐over design. Most trials looked at very short‐term effects of inhaled bronchodilators, and therefore did not measure longer‐term outcomes. The certainty of evidence across all outcomes was very low, and therefore we have been unable to describe any effects with certainty. Plain language summary Short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators for cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence for using short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators (treatments which widen and open the airways, making it easier to breathe) in people with cystic fibrosis. Short‐acting bronchodilators take effect quickly and generally last 4 to 6 hours. We were interested in any type of short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator, given at any dose, and by any type of device (inhalers or nebulisers). Both nebulisers and inhalers deliver medicine. Nebulisers turn liquid medication into an easily‐inhaled mist. They vary in type but need a power source, e.g. a rechargeable battery, to function. Inhalers deliver short bursts of medicine (as an aerosol or dry powder) via a manual handheld device. The most common type of inhaler is a metered‐dose inhaler. Inhalers can be used with spacers (empty tubes, usually made from plastic that slot onto the mouthpiece of the inhaler).  Inhaled bronchodilators are used by many people with cystic fibrosis to help them breathe, and to make it easier to clear mucus from their lungs. We wanted to know if these treatments were better than a placebo (dummy) treatment or another type of short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator. Search date The evidence is current to 28 March 2022. Trial characteristics The review included 11 trials with 191   people with cystic fibrosis aged between 5   and 40   years of age .  Trials compared two different types of short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator (beta‐2 agonists such as salbutamol or albuterol, and muscarinic antagonists such as ipratropium bromide) against a placebo substance which contained no medication, or a different short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator; three of the trials had three comparison groups ‐ beta‐2 agonists versus muscarinic antagonists versus placebo. All trials were cross‐over trials, so all of the people included in the trial received both treatments at different times, and the order that they received the treatments was random.   The trials lasted from a single‐dose trial to 6 months. Eight trials looked at the effects of short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists versus placebo, four trials at the effects of a short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonist versus placebo, and three trials looked at the effects of a short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonist with a short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonist. Key results All trials looked at the effect of short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators on lung function, measured as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ), but this was reported in different ways and at different time points.  We are uncertain whether any of the short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators have an effect on FEV 1  compared to placebo. The trials were too small and there were not enough data to show if there was an effect or not. Only six of the 11 trials reported on harmful effects of treatment: one trial reported no harmful effects and five trials reported mild tremors, dry mouth and fatigue. Certainty of the evidence The certainty of the evidence across all trials was very low. All trials used a cross‐over design where the participants are given one treatment and then swapped to the other treatment with a washout period (the length of time for a drug to be eliminated from the body) in between. It is possible that the clinical status of participants was not the same at the beginning of the first treatment phase as at the beginning of the second treatment phase. The trials were also very small and were carried out more than 10 years ago.","6","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Bronchodilator Agents [therapeutic use]; *Cystic Fibrosis [complications, drug therapy]; Administration, Inhalation; Adult; Child; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Muscarinic Antagonists","10.1002/14651858.CD013666.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013666.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Digital health technologies can provide easy‐to‐access health information and may help improve healthcare and outcomes in individuals with long‐term conditions. However, its effects for delivering and monitoring exercise programs in CF have not yet been synthesized. Objectives To evaluate the benefits and harms of digital health technologies for delivering and monitoring exercise programs, increasing adherence to exercise regimens, and improving key clinical outcomes in people with CF. Search methods We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 21 November 2022. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs of digital health technologies for delivering or monitoring exercise programs in CF. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. physical activity, 2. self‐management behavior, and 3. pulmonary exacerbations. Our secondary outcomes were 4. usability of technologies, 5. quality of life, 6. lung function, 7. muscle strength, 8. exercise capacity, 9. physiologic parameters, and 10. adverse events. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. Main results We identified four parallel RCTs (three single‐center and one multicenter with 231 participants aged six years or older). The RCTs evaluated different modes of digital health technologies with distinct purposes, combined with diverse interventions. We identified important methodologic concerns in the RCTs, including insufficient information on the randomization process, blinding of outcome assessors, balance of non‐protocol interventions across groups, and whether the analyses performed corrected for bias due to missing outcome data. Non‐reporting of results may also be a concern, especially because some planned outcome results were reported incompletely. Furthermore, each trial had a small number of participants, resulting in imprecise effects. These limitations on the risk of bias, and on the precision of effect estimates resulted in overall low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence. We undertook four comparisons and present the findings for our primary outcomes below. There is no information on the effectiveness of other modes of digital health technologies for monitoring physical activity or delivering exercise programs in people with CF, on adverse events related to the use of digital health technologies either for delivering or monitoring exercise programs in CF, and on their long‐term effects (more than one year). Digital health technologies for monitoring physical activity Wearable fitness tracker plus personalized exercise prescription compared to personalized exercise prescription alone One trial (40 adults with CF) evaluated this outcome, but did not report data for any of our primary outcomes. Wearable fitness tracker plus text message for personalized feedback and goal setting compared to wearable fitness tracker alone The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of a wearable fitness tracker plus text message for personalized feedback and goal setting, compared to wearable technology alone on physical activity measured by step count at six‐month follow‐up (mean difference [MD] 675.00 steps, 95% confidence interval [CI] −2406.37 to 3756.37; 1 trial, 32 participants). The same study measured pulmonary exacerbation rates and reported finding no difference between groups. Web‐based application to record, monitor, and set goals on physical activity plus usual care compared to usual care alone Using a web‐based application to record, monitor, and set goals on physical activity plus usual care may result in little to no difference on time spent in moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity measured via accelerometry compared to usual care alone at six‐month follow‐up (MD −4 minutes/day, 95% CI −37 to 29; 1 trial, 63 participants). Low certainty‐evidence from the same trial suggests that the intervention may result in little to no difference on pulmonary exacerbations during 12 months of follow‐up (median 1 respiratory hospitalization, interquartile range [IQR] 0 to 3) versus control (median 1 respiratory hospitalization, IQR 0 to 2; P = 0.6). Digital health technologies for delivering exercise programs Web‐based versus face‐to‐face exercise delivery The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of web‐based compared to face‐to‐face exercise delivery on adherence to physical activity as assessed by the number of participants who completed all exercise sessions after three months of intervention (risk ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.23; 1 trial, 51 participants). Authors' conclusions The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of an exercise program plus the use of a wearable fitness tracker integrated with a social media platform compared with exercise prescription alone and on the effects of receiving a wearable fitness tracker plus text message for personalized feedback and goal setting, compared to a wearable fitness tracker alone. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that using a web‐based application to record, monitor, and set goals on physical activity plus usual care may result in little to no difference in time spent in moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity, total time spent in activity, pulmonary exacerbations, quality of life, lung function, and exercise capacity compared to usual care alone. Regarding the use of digital health technologies for delivering exercise programs in CF, the evidence is very uncertain about the effects of using a wearable fitness tracker plus personalized exercise prescription compared to personalized exercise prescription alone. Further high‐quality RCTs, with blinded outcome assessors, reporting the effects of digital health technologies on clinically important outcome measures, such as physical activity participation and intensity, self‐management behavior, and the occurrence of pulmonary exacerbations in the long term are needed. The results of six ongoing RCTs identified through our searches may help clarify the effects of different modes of digital health technologies for delivering and monitoring exercise programs in people with CF. Plain language summary Digital interventions for delivering exercise in people with Cystic Fibrosis Review question What are the benefits and risks of using digital interventions for delivering or monitoring, or both, physical activity in people with cystic fibrosis (CF)? Key messages Taken together, the results of these trials suggest the following. – Using a web‐based application to record, monitor, and set goals on physical activity plus usual care may result in little to no difference on physical activity and pulmonary exacerbations (flare up of disease) compared to usual care alone. – The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of an exercise program plus the use of a wearable fitness tracker integrated with a social media platform plus exercise prescription, compared with exercise prescription alone, and on the effects of receiving a wearable fitness tracker plus text message for personalized feedback and goal setting, compared to a wearable fitness tracker alone. – We are very uncertain about the effects of web‐based compared to face‐to‐face exercise delivery. What is digital health technology? When we talk about digital interventions, we mean using technology to allow communication and the sending of information between an individual and a healthcare provider to help manage a person's condition remotely. This can be done by mobile phone, tablet computer applications, or other types of technologies. What is CF? CF is an inherited disease that causes problems with the lungs, digestive system, and other organs. People with CF have thick and sticky mucus that blocks airways, leads to lung damage, and makes infections more likely. Most people with CF have respiratory symptoms such as coughing with more mucus and shortness of breath. How digital health technologies can help people with CF? A sedentary lifestyle may contribute to the progression of physical and functional impairment in people with CF, so exercise is recommended as part of the CF treatment plan. However, not everyone sticks to the exercise plan as they should. We wanted to see if digital technology can help people with CF to exercise and if it can keep track of the exercise they do. What did we want to find out? How can digital health technologies help deliver and monitor exercise programs in adults and children with CF? What did we do? To answer this question, we searched medical databases for all relevant trials on the topic. We collected and analyzed all the data currently available from the trials. What did we find? We found four trials involving 231 participants (aged six years or older). The trials lasted from three months to one year. These trials used different types of digital interventions. While one trial used a digital intervention to deliver an exercise program, the other three used a digital intervention to monitor people's physical activity. Main results One trial used a web‐based application to record, monitor, and set goals on physical activity plus usual care and investigators found there may be little to no difference on the amount of physical activity undertaken or on the number of pulmonary exacerbations that people experienced compared to usual care alone. We are not confident in the results of the trial looking at whether a wearable fitness tracker with an exercise prescription can provide important benefits to people with CF compared to using only exercise prescription. We also cannot be sure whether using a wearable fitness tracker plus text message for personalized feedback and goal setting is effective compared to a wearable fitness tracker alone. Furthermore, we are very uncertain on the effects of web‐based compared to face‐to‐face exercise delivery. No trials formally evaluated whether digital interventions could lead to harms and we found little or no data on other important outcomes such as participation in physical activity, self‐management behavior (the ability to manage our actions), and the occurrence of pulmonary exacerbations. There is no information on the effectiveness of other types of digital health technologies for monitoring physical activity or delivering exercise programs in people with CF, and on their long‐term effects (more than one year). What are the limitations of the evidence? We included only four trials, each with a small number of participants. The authors of these trials reported little information on how they were conducted. This decreased our confidence in their results. There may be bias when the people assessing a person's test results know which treatment the person received. In the included trials, it was not clear if the investigators tried to prevent the outcome assessors from knowing each person's treatment. Some trials also did not report in full the results that they planned in their protocol and this may also introduce bias. Therefore, we are uncertain about the effects of digital interventions for monitoring and delivering exercise in people with CF, and further better‐quality trials are needed to clarify its effects. Overall, we had only low to very low confidence in the results. How up to date is this evidence? The evidence is current to 21 November 2022.","6","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Cystic Fibrosis [therapy]; Adult; Digital Technology; Exercise; Exercise Therapy; Humans; Multicenter Studies as Topic; Muscle Strength; Quality of Life","10.1002/14651858.CD014605.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD014605.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD001506.PUB5","Wark, P; McDonald, VM; Smith, S","Nebulised hypertonic saline for cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2023","Abstract - Background Hypertonic saline enhances mucociliary clearance and may lessen the destructive inflammatory process in the airways. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To investigate efficacy and tolerability of nebulised hypertonic saline treatment in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) compared to placebo or other treatments that enhance mucociliary clearance. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched ongoing trials databases. Most recent search: 25 April 2022. Selection criteria We included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials assessing hypertonic saline compared to placebo or other mucolytic therapy, for any duration or dose regimen in people with CF (any age or disease severity). Data collection and analysis Two authors independently reviewed all identified trials and data, and assessed trial quality. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. For cross‐over trials we stipulated a one‐week washout period. We planned to use results from a paired analysis in the review, but this was only possible in one trial. For other cross‐over trials, we chose to treat the trials as if they were parallel. Main results We included 24 trials (1318 participants, aged one month to 56 years); we excluded 29 trials, two trials are ongoing and six are awaiting classification. We judged 15 of the 24 included trials to have a high risk of bias due to participants' ability to discern the taste of the solutions. Hypertonic saline 3% to 7% versus placebo (stable disease) We are uncertain whether the regular use of nebulised hypertonic saline in stable lung disease leads to an improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) % predicted at four weeks, (mean difference (MD) 3.30%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 5.89; 4 trials, 246 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). In preschool children we found no difference in lung clearance index (LCI) at four weeks, but a small improvement after 48 weeks of treatment with hypertonic saline compared to isotonic saline (MD ‐0.60, 95% CI ‐1.00 to ‐0.19; 2 trials, 192 participants). We are also uncertain whether hypertonic saline made a difference to mucociliary clearance, pulmonary exacerbations or adverse events compared to placebo. Hypertonic saline versus control (acute exacerbation) Two trials compared hypertonic saline to control, but only one provided data. There may be little or no difference in lung function measured by FEV 1  % predicted after hypertonic saline compared to isotonic saline (MD 5.10%, 95% CI ‐14.67 to 24.87; 1 trial, 130 participants). Neither trial reported any deaths or measures of sputum clearance. There were no serious adverse events. Hypertonic saline versus rhDNase Three trials compared a similar dose of hypertonic saline to recombinant deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase); two trials (61 participants) provided data for inclusion in the review. We are uncertain whether there was an effect of hypertonic saline on FEV 1  % predicted after three weeks (MD 1.60%, 95% CI ‐7.96 to 11.16; 1 trial, 14 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). At three months, rhDNase may lead to a greater increase in FEV 1  % predicted than hypertonic saline (5 mL twice daily) at 12 weeks in participants with moderate to severe lung disease (MD 8.00%, 95% CI 2.00 to 14.00; low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether adverse events differed between the two treatments. No deaths were reported. Hypertonic saline versus amiloride One trial (12 participants) compared hypertonic saline to amiloride but did not report on most of our outcomes. The trial found that there was no difference between treatments in measures of sputum clearance (very low‐certainty evidence). Hypertonic saline compared with sodium‐2‐mercaptoethane sulphonate (Mistabron®) One trial (29 participants) compared hypertonic saline to sodium‐2‐mercaptoethane sulphonate. The trial did not measure our primary outcomes. There was no difference between treatments in any measures of sputum clearance, courses of antibiotics or adverse events (very low‐certainty evidence). Hypertonic saline versus mannitol One trial (12 participants) compared hypertonic saline to mannitol, but did not report lung function at relevant time points for this review; there were no differences in sputum clearance, but mannitol was reported to be more 'irritating' (very low‐certainty evidence). Hypertonic saline versus xylitol Two trials compared hypertonic saline to xylitol, but we are uncertain whether there is any difference in FEV 1  % predicted or median time to exacerbation between groups (very low‐certainty evidence). No other outcomes were reported in the review. Hypertonic saline 7% versus hypertonic saline 3% We are uncertain whether there was an improvement in FEV 1  % predicted after treatment with 7% hypertonic saline compared with 3% (very low‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions We are very uncertain if regular use of nebulised hypertonic saline by adults and children over the age of 12 years with CF results in an improvement in lung function after four weeks (three trials; very low‐certainty evidence); there was no difference seen at 48 weeks (one trial; low‐certainty evidence). Hypertonic saline improved LCI modestly in children under the age of six years. Evidence from one small cross‐over trial in children indicates that rhDNase may lead to better lung function than hypertonic saline at three months; qualifying this, we highlight that while the study did demonstrate that the improvement in FEV 1  was greater with daily rhDNase, there were no differences seen in any of the secondary outcomes. Hypertonic saline does appear to be an effective adjunct to physiotherapy during acute exacerbations of lung disease in adults. However, for the outcomes assessed, the certainty of the evidence ranged from very low to low at best, according to the GRADE criteria. The role of hypertonic saline in conjunction with cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapy now needs to be considered, and future research needs to focus on this aspect. Plain language summary Hypertonic saline (salt water with at least 3% salt) nebulised as a fine mist through a mask or mouthpiece for cystic fibrosis Review question Is inhaling hypertonic saline (salt water with at least 3% salt) as a mist through a mask or mouthpiece better for improving mucus clearance in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) than a placebo (a mist with no or very little salt) or other agents? Background People with CF produce large amounts of thick mucus which is difficult to clear and blocks up their airways. Chest physiotherapy or medication, e.g. hypertonic saline, or both combined, are used to try and clear this mucus from the airways. Hypertonic saline is water with a concentration of 3% to 7% salt and is inhaled as a fine mist. This is an update of an earlier review. Key messages • We are uncertain whether inhaling nebulised hypertonic saline regularly improves lung function compared to placebo. • Nebulised hypertonic saline does seem to work well as an add‐on to physiotherapy. What did we do? We searched for studies that looked at the use of nebulised hypertonic saline compared to either a placebo or a different type of treatment for clearing mucus from the lungs. We compared the size and methods of the studies and stated how confident we were in the results. What did we find? We included 24 trials with 1318 people with CF aged between one month and 56 years. Two thirds of the trials compared hypertonic saline to a placebo (a dummy treatment); the remaining trials compared hypertonic saline to another type of mucus clearing treatment (including mannitol; rhDNase (Pulmozyme®); amiloride; Mistabron®; xylitol); and one trial compared 7% hypertonic saline with 3% hypertonic saline. Trials assessed different concentrations of hypertonic saline with different nebulisers and different treatment schedules; the most common treatment was twice‐daily 7% hypertonic saline and the most common nebuliser was ultrasonic. Most trials treated people with a bronchodilator to widen the airways before giving the hypertonic saline. Main results Hypertonic saline 3% to 7% versus placebo We are not sure whether hypertonic saline leads to an improvement in lung function in stable disease after four weeks. Two trials showed that there may be a small improvement in lung function (measured using the lung clearance index) with hypertonic saline compared to placebo in preschool children. We are also unsure whether hypertonic saline makes a difference to clearing mucus from the lungs, exacerbations or side effects compared to placebo. During exacerbations, we found that there may be little or no difference in lung function after hypertonic saline compared to placebo. The trials did not report any serious side effects and there were no deaths. One study compared 7% hypertonic saline with a lower concentration of hypertonic saline (3%); we are uncertain whether the higher concentration improved lung function. Hypertonic saline versus mucus mobilising treatments Three trials compared hypertonic saline with rhDNase and found that rhDNase may lead to an improvement in lung function compared to hypertonic saline after three months. We are unsure whether there is any difference in side effects. One trial compared hypertonic saline to amiloride and a further trial compared hypertonic saline to sodium‐2‐mercaptoethane sulphonate (Mistabron®), but neither of the trials gave information about the effect of the treatments on lung function. Similarly, a trial comparing hypertonic saline with mannitol did not give information about the effects on lung function, but they did report that there was no difference between treatments in clearing mucus from the lungs. People taking mannitol said it was more irritating than hypertonic saline. Two trials compared hypertonic saline with xylitol, but we are unsure if there is any difference in lung function and none of our other outcomes were measured. What are the limitations of this evidence? We are not confident in the evidence from these trials. There is a high risk that people knew which treatment they were receiving in half the trials as they could taste the difference between the solutions. Other factors that made us unsure of the results were the small numbers of people taking part in the trials combined with a wide variation in results; also, some trials limited participants to those who could tolerate hypertonic saline or to certain age groups. How up to date is this evidence?

Airway clearance techniques (ACTs) and exercise therapy are key components of physiotherapy, which is considered integral in managing CF; however, low adherence is well‐documented. Poor physiotherapy adherence may lead to repeated respiratory infections, reduced exercise tolerance, breathlessness, reduced quality of life, malaise and reduced life expectancy, as well as increased use of pharmacology, healthcare access and hospital admission. Therefore, evidence‐based strategies to inform clinical practice and improve adherence to physiotherapy may improve quality of life and reduce treatment burden. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions to enhance adherence to airway clearance treatment and exercise therapy in people with CF and their effects on health outcomes, such as pulmonary exacerbations, exercise capacity and health‐related quality of life. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of last search: 1 March 2023. We also searched online trials registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 28 March 2023. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs of parallel design assessing any intervention aimed at enhancing adherence to physiotherapy in people with CF versus no intervention, another intervention or usual care. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently checked search results for eligible studies and independently extracted data. We used standard procedures recommended by Cochrane and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE system. Main results Two RCTs (77 participants with CF; age range 2 to 20 years; 44 (57%) males) met the inclusion criteria of this review. One study employed an intervention to improve adherence to exercise and the second an intervention to improve adherence to ACT. Both studies measured outcomes at baseline and at three months, but neither study formally assessed our primary outcome of adherence in terms of our planned outcome measures, and results were dependent on self‐reported data. Adherence to ACTs One RCT (43 participants) assessed using specifically‐composed music alongside ACTs compared to self‐selected or no music (usual care). The ACT process consisted of nebuliser inhalation treatment, ACTs and relaxation or antibiotic nebuliser treatment. We graded all evidence as very low certainty. This study reported adherence to ACTs using the Morisky‐Green questionnaire and also participants' perception of treatment time and enjoyment, which may influence adherence (outcome not reported specifically in this review). We are uncertain whether participants who received specifically‐composed music may be more likely to adhere at six and 12 weeks compared to those who received usual care, risk ratio (RR) 1.75 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 2.86) and RR 1.56 (95% CI 1.01 to 2.40) respectively. There may not be any difference in adherence when comparing specifically‐composed music to self‐selected music at six weeks, RR 1.21 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.68) or 12 weeks, RR 1.52 (95% CI 0.97 to 2.38); or self‐selected music to usual care at six weeks, RR 1.44 (95% CI 0.82 to 2.52) or 12 weeks, RR 1.03 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.86). The music study also reported the number of respiratory infections requiring hospitalisation at 12 weeks, with no difference seen in the risk of hospitalisation between all groups. Adherence to exercise One RCT (24 participants) compared the provision of a manual of aerobic exercises, recommended exercise prescription plus two‐weekly follow‐up phone calls to reinforce exercise practice over a period of three months to verbal instructions for aerobic exercise according to the CF centre's protocol. We graded all evidence as very low certainty. We are uncertain whether an educational intervention leads to more participants in the intervention group undertaking increased regular physical activity at three months (self‐report), RR 3.67 (95% CI 1.24 to 10.85), and there was no reported difference between groups in the number undertaking physical activity three times per week or undertaking at least 40 minutes of physical activity. No effect was seen on secondary outcome measures of spirometry, exercise capacity or any CF quality of life domains. This study did not report on the frequency of respiratory infections (hospitalised or not) or adverse events. Authors' conclusions We are uncertain whether a music‐based motivational intervention may increase adherence to ACTs or affect the risk of hospitalisation for a respiratory infection. We are also uncertain whether an educational intervention increases adherence to exercise or reduces the frequency of respiratory infection‐related hospital admission. However, these results are largely based on self‐reported data and the impact of strategies to improve adherence to ACT and exercise in children and adolescents with stable CF remains inconclusive. Given that adherence to ACT and exercise therapy are fundamental to the clinical management of people with CF, there is an urgent need for well‐designed, large‐scale clinical trials in this area, which should conform to the CONSORT statement for standards of reporting and use appropriate, validated outcome measures. Studies should also ensure full disclosure of data for all important clinical outcomes. Plain language summary Which strategies might influence how accurately and how long people with cystic fibrosis complete chest physiotherapy and exercise? Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a progressive and life‐limiting genetic condition that affects many systems in the body, especially the lungs. In the UK, 1 in every 2500 babies is diagnosed with CF. Physiotherapy is a very important part of treatment for people with CF. The two main goals of chest physiotherapy are to clear sticky mucus from the airways to prevent repeated infections and lung damage and to maintain physical fitness through exercise. Chest physiotherapy can help prevent poor health and hospital admissions and may contribute to improving quality of life and life expectancy, but it is often considered a burden. People with CF may have to complete seven or more chest physiotherapy treatments a day, which can be time‐consuming, tiring, and disruptive. As a result, people with CF may complete as little as 30% of their chest physiotherapy sessions, with rates often dipping during some stages in a person's life (such as adolescence). Although exercise is often viewed more positively by people with CF, they may not always carry out their exercises because of tiredness, feeling unwell, or a lack of time. We wanted to explore what we can do to encourage people with CF to complete more of their planned chest physiotherapy or exercise. We were interested in a range of possible strategies including leaflets, videos, apps, rewards, motivational tools, exercise games, diaries, and text messages. What did we do? We looked for high‐quality studies of people with CF (aged seven years and upwards). We planned to include any strategy aimed at improving adherence to chest physiotherapy or exercise compared to no strategy, usual care, or another type of strategy. What did we find? We found only two studies that we could include in our review. One was an educational study to improve adherence to exercise, and the second was a motivational study to increase adherence to chest physiotherapy. In the exercise study (34 participants), those who received a written manual seemed to be more physically active at the end of the study, compared to those who were given verbal advice only, but we are not certain whether this was due to the manual. There were no other differences between groups in terms of quality of life, lung function, or exercise capacity. In the chest physiotherapy study (43 participants), we are uncertain whether listening to specially‐composed music during chest physiotherapy leads to more time spent completing treatments. We did not find that listening to music people chose themselves while doing physiotherapy led to completion of more treatment compared to not listening to any music. We did not find any real difference in hospital admissions due to chest infection between any of the groups. What are the limitations of the evidence? In both studies, the groups were very small and there were problems in trial design and reporting. This means that the reliability of the results might be affected. As a result, the evidence for strategies to improve adherence to physiotherapy and adherence to exercise was very uncertain. Whilst these studies suggest that some strategies may be helpful, future research needs to consider ways to accurately measure adherence. In the meantime, physiotherapists treating people with CF should follow local guidelines and national standards of care related to CF and treatment adherence. How up to date is the evidence?

Bisphosphonates can increase bone mineral density and decrease the risk of new fractures in post‐menopausal women and people receiving long‐term oral corticosteroids. This is an updated version of a previous review. Objectives To assess the effects of bisphosphonates on the frequency of fractures, bone mineral density, quality of life, adverse events, trial withdrawals, and survival in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register of references (identified from electronic database searches and hand searches of journals and abstract books) on 5 May 2022. We performed additional searches of PubMed, clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP (International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) on 5 May 2022. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of at least six months duration studying bisphosphonates in people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Authors independently selected trials, extracted data and assessed risk of bias in included studies. Trial investigators were contacted to obtain missing data. We judged the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Main results We included nine trials with a total of 385 participants (272 adults and 113 children (aged five to 18 years)). Trial durations ranged from six months to two years. Only two of the studies were considered to have a low risk of bias for all the domains.  Bisphosphonates compared to control in people with cystic fibrosis who have not had a lung transplant Seven trials included only adult participants without lung transplants, one trial included both adults and children without lung transplantation (total of 238 adults and 113 children). We analysed adults (n = 238) and children (n = 113) separately. Adults Three trials assessed intravenous bisphosphonates (one assessed pamidronate and two assessed zoledronate) and five trials assessed oral bisphosphonates (one assessed risedronate and four assessed alendronate). Bisphosphonates were compared to either placebo or calcium (with or without additional vitamin D). Data showed no difference between treatment or control groups in new vertebral fractures at 12 months (odds ratio (OR) 0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 2.09; 5 trials, 142 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and two trials (44 participants) reported no vertebral fractures at 24 months. There was no difference in non‐vertebral fractures at 12 months (OR 2.11, 95% CI 0.18 to 25.35; 4 trials, 95 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and again two trials (44 participants) reported no non‐vertebral fractures at 24 months. There was no difference in total fractures between groups at 12 months (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.50; 5 trials, 142 participants) and no fractures were reported in two trials (44 participants) at 24 months. At 12 months, bisphosphonates may increase bone mineral density at the lumbar spine (mean difference (MD) 6.31, 95% CI 5.39 to 7.22; 6 trials, 171 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and at the hip or femur (MD 4.41, 95% 3.44 to 5.37; 5 trials, 155 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There was no clear difference in quality of life scores at 12 months (1 trial, 47 participants; low‐certainty evidence), but bisphosphonates probably led to more adverse events (bone pain) at 12 months (OR 8.49, 95% CI 3.20 to 22.56; 7 trials, 206 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Children The single trial in 113 children compared oral alendronate to placebo. We graded all evidence as low certainty. At 12 months we found no difference between treatment and placebo in new vertebral fractures (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.03 to 3.13; 1 trial, 113 participants) and non‐vertebral fractures (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.04; 1 trial, 113 participants). There was also no difference in total fractures (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.61; 1 trial, 113 participants). Bisphosphonates may increase bone mineral density at the lumbar spine at 12 months (MD 14.50, 95% CI 12.91 to 16.09). There was no difference in bone or muscle pain (MD 3.00, 95% CI 0.12 to 75.22), fever (MD 3.00, 95% CI 0.12 to 75.22) or gastrointestinal adverse events (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.20 to 2.26). The trial did not measure bone mineral density at the hip/femur or report on quality of life.  Bisphosphonates compared to control in people with cystic fibrosis who have had a lung transplant One trial of 34 adults who had undergone lung transplantation compared intravenous pamidronate to no bisphosphonate treatment. It did not report at 12 months and we report the 24‐month data (not assessed by GRADE). There was no difference in the number of fractures, either vertebral or non‐vertebral. However, bone mineral density increased with treatment at the lumbar spine (MD 6.20, 95% CI 4.28 to 8.12) and femur (MD 7.90, 95% CI 5.78 to 10.02). No participants in either group reported either bone pain or fever. The trial did not measure quality of life. Authors' conclusions Oral and intravenous bisphosphonates may increase bone mineral density in people with cystic fibrosis, but there are insufficient data to determine whether treatment reduces fractures. Severe bone pain and flu‐like symptoms may occur with intravenous bisphosphonates. Before any firm conclusions can be drawn, trials in larger populations, including children, and of longer duration are needed to determine effects on fracture rate and survival. Additional trials are needed to determine if bone pain is more common or severe (or both) with the more potent zoledronate and if corticosteroids can ameliorate or prevent these adverse events. Future trials should also assess gastrointestinal adverse effects associated with oral bisphosphonates. Plain language summary Bisphosphonates for osteoporosis in people with cystic fibrosis Review question What are the effects of bisphosphonates (drugs that prevent the loss of bone mass), either oral (taken by mouth) or intravenous (given directly into a vein), on osteoporosis in people with cystic fibrosis (CF)? Background Cystic fibrosis is a serious genetic disorder that affects many organs in the body (e.g. lungs and pancreas). Around 23.5% of people with CF experience reduced bone mineral density (BMD), commonly known as osteoporosis, which increases the likelihood of bone fractures. The short‐term and long‐term effects of fractures (e.g .  ribs and in the spine) may make lung disease worse, and hospitalisation more frequent. Bisphosphonates are drugs that increase BMD by slowing down how fast bone is resorbed. They are used to treat osteoporosis caused by the menopause or the use of corticosteroid drugs. We wanted to know if bisphosphonates affect the frequency of bone fractures, BMD and quality of life, and if they have any side effects in people with CF. This is an update of a previous review. Search date The evidence is current to 5 May 2022. Study characteristics We included nine trials with 272 adults and 113 children (aged five to 18 years) lasting from six months to two years. Eight trials included 238 adults without lung transplants; three of these gave intravenous bisphosphonates (one gave pamidronate and two gave zoledronate) and five trials gave oral bisphosphonates (one gave risedronate and four gave alendronate). Trials compared bisphosphonates to either placebo (drug with no active treatment) or calcium (with or without additional vitamin D). One of these eight trials, comparing oral alendronate to placebo, also included 113 children and we analysed their results separately. The last trial of 34 adults who had undergone lung transplantation compared intravenous pamidronate to no bisphosphonate treatment. Key results Bisphosphonates consistently increased BMD in adults at the lumbar spine and hip regions. It also increased BMD in children at the lumbar spine. Treatment with bisphosphonates did not appear to reduce the rates of fractures (either in the spine or elsewhere) or deaths in adults or children. However, this may be related to the small numbers of participants involved and the short duration of the trials. Severe bone pain and flu‐like symptoms were commonly linked to intravenous bisphosphonates, especially in people not using corticosteroids. More research is needed to assess the effect of pre‐treatment with corticosteroids. Additional trials are needed to determine if bone pain is more common or severe (or both) with the stronger drug zoledronate and if corticosteroids lessen or prevent these adverse events. Additional trials should also assess gastrointestinal adverse effects in the stomach and digestive tract which are linked to oral bisphosphonates. Trials with larger numbers of participants with longer follow‐up are needed to show how bisphosphonates affect fracture rate and survival. More trials including children with cystic fibrosis should be undertaken to better understand the effects, benefits and harms these drugs may have on them. Bisphosphonates compared to control in people with CF who have not had a lung transplant Adults Five trials (142 participants) reported no difference between treatment or control groups in new vertebral or non‐vertebral fractures at 12 months and two trials (44 participants) reported no fractures at 24 months. At 12 months, results from six trials (171 participants) showed bisphosphonates may increase BMD at the lumbar spine and five trials (155 participants) reported the same effect on BMD at the hip or femur. There was no clear difference in quality of life (QoL) scores at 12 months, but bisphosphonates probably led to more bone pain at 12 months as reported by seven trials (206 participants). Children At 12 months we found no difference between treatment and placebo in new vertebral or non‐vertebral fractures. Bisphosphonates may increase BMD at the lumbar spine at 12 months. There was no difference in bone or muscle pain, in fever or in gastrointestinal side effects. The trial did not measure BMD at the hip/femur or report on QoL.  Bisphosphonates compared to control in people with CF who have had a lung transplant This trial only reported results at 24 months. There was no difference in the number of fractures, either vertebral or non‐vertebral, but BMD increased with treatment at the lumbar spine and femur. No one in either group reported either bone pain or fever. The trial did not measure QoL. Certainty of the evidence The certainty of the evidence was mixed and we had some concerns regarding different aspects of bias in all trials. At least three of the trials were partially funded by pharmaceutical companies. In one trial the people looking at the bone scans and reporting them may have known which participants had been treated with bisphosphonates; this knowledge may have affected their objectivity. Two trials did not report on fractures, but we do not think these are likely to have significantly changed the review's results.

"CD012040.PUB3","Aslam, AA; Sinha, IP; Southern, KW","Ataluren and similar compounds (specific therapies for premature termination codon class I mutations) for cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2023","Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common, life‐shortening, genetic disorder in populations of Northern European descent caused by the mutation of a single gene that codes for the production of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. This protein coordinates the transport of salt (and bicarbonate) across cell surfaces, and the mutation most notably affects the airways. In the lungs of people with CF, the defective protein compromises mucociliary clearance and makes the airway prone to chronic infection and inflammation, damaging the structure of the airways and eventually leading to respiratory failure. In addition, abnormalities in the truncated CFTR protein lead to other systemic complications, including malnutrition, diabetes and subfertility. Five classes of mutation have been described, depending on the impact of the mutation on the processing of the CFTR protein in the cell. In class I mutations, premature termination codons prevent the production of any functional protein, resulting in severe CF. Therapies targeting class I mutations aim to enable the normal cellular mechanism to read through the mutation, potentially restoring the production of the CFTR protein. This could, in turn, normalise salt transport in the cells and decrease the chronic infection and inflammation that characterises lung disease in people with CF. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To evaluate the benefits and harms of ataluren and similar compounds on clinically important outcomes in people with CF with class I mutations (premature termination codons). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, which is compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. The last search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register was conducted on 7 March 2022. We searched clinical trial registries maintained by the European Medicines Agency, the US National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization. The last search of the clinical trials registries was conducted on 4 October 2022. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of parallel design comparing ataluren and similar compounds (specific therapies for class I mutations) with placebo in people with CF who have at least one class I mutation. Data collection and analysis For the included trials, the review authors independently extracted data, assessed the risk of bias and evaluated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE; trial authors were contacted for additional data. Main results Our searches identified 56 references to 20 trials; of these, 18 trials were excluded. Both the included parallel RCTs compared ataluren to placebo for 48 weeks in 517 participants (males and females; age range six to 53 years) with CF who had at least one nonsense mutation (a type of class I mutation). The certainty of evidence and risk of bias assessments for the trials were moderate overall. Random sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding of trial personnel were well documented; participant blinding was less clear. Some participant data were excluded from the analysis in one trial that also had a high risk of bias for selective outcome reporting. PTC Therapeutics Incorporated sponsored both trials with grant support from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the US Food and Drug Administration's Office of Orphan Products Development and the National Institutes of Health. The trials reported no difference between treatment groups in terms of quality of life, and no improvement in respiratory function measures. Ataluren was associated with a higher rate of episodes of renal impairment (risk ratio 12.81, 95% confidence interval 2.46 to 66.65; P = 0.002; I 2  = 0%; 2 trials, 517 participants). The trials reported no treatment effect for ataluren for the review's secondary outcomes of pulmonary exacerbation, computed tomography score, weight, body mass index and sweat chloride. No deaths were reported in the trials. The earlier trial performed a post hoc subgroup analysis of participants not receiving concomitant chronic inhaled tobramycin (n = 146). This analysis demonstrated favourable results for ataluren (n = 72) for the relative change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) per cent (%) predicted and pulmonary exacerbation rate. The later trial aimed to prospectively assess the efficacy of ataluren in participants not concomitantly receiving inhaled aminoglycosides, and found no difference between ataluren and placebo in FEV 1  % predicted and pulmonary exacerbation rate.  Authors' conclusions There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the effect of ataluren as a therapy for people with CF with class I mutations. One trial reported favourable results for ataluren in a post hoc subgroup analysis of participants not receiving chronic inhaled aminoglycosides, but these were not reproduced in the later trial, suggesting that the earlier results may have occurred by chance. Future trials should carefully assess for adverse events, notably renal impairment, and consider the possibility of drug interactions. Cross‐over trials should be avoided, given the potential for the treatment to change the natural history of CF. Plain language summary Ataluren and similar compounds (specific therapies for premature termination codon class I mutations) for cystic fibrosis Review question Can ataluren (and similar compounds specifically targeting class I mutations in cystic fibrosis (CF)) improve the quality of life and lung function of people with CF without having adverse effects? Key messages What is CF? In people with CF, the gene encoding a protein called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is faulty. This especially affects the airways, causing the airway surface to dry out and making it difficult to clear thick mucus. This leads to progressive infection and damages the lungs, shortening life expectancy. How will ataluren treat CF? In people with certain CF genetic mutations where the genetic instructions for producing  the CFTR protein are interrupted (known as premature termination codon or class I mutations), ataluren (and similar medicines) may be able to skip over the break in the faulty gene sequence and allow the body to produce a corrected version of the CFTR protein. By correcting the protein, the airway surface should remain hydrated, allowing people with CF to better clear their mucus and so develop fewer lung infections. What did we want to find out? We wanted to know whether ataluren can improve the quality of life and lung function of people with CF, and whether it can do so without any side effects. We also wanted to measure the effects on lung infections (need for hospital visits or additional antibiotics), survival, nutritional status (weight, body mass index and height) and whether treatment was cost‐effective. What did we do? We searched for trials that directly compared drugs such as ataluren to placebo (treatment not containing an active drug) or to a different treatment for these specific genetic mutations in any people with CF. What did we find? We found two trials including 517 people (males and females between 6 and 53 years of age) comparing ataluren to a placebo. The trials lasted 48 weeks and everyone taking part in the trials had at least one gene with a class I mutation. Key results In people taking ataluren, there was no improvement in clinical outcomes such as quality of life, lung function, exacerbations (flare up of disease), sweat chloride (salt) levels or weight compared with people taking placebo. The trials found that kidney damage was more common in people taking ataluren.  The earlier trial analysed their results in a way not originally planned to see whether the effects of ataluren and placebo were different in people using inhaled tobramycin (an antibiotic) on a long‐term basis compared with people not taking the inhaled antibiotic. In people taking ataluren but not using inhaled tobramycin, lung function declined at a slower rate and there were fewer exacerbations than in people in the placebo group also not using inhaled tobramycin. The later trial specifically recruited people not taking tobramycin to see whether this really was an effect of the antibiotic, but the investigators did not find any difference between the ataluren and placebo groups for changes in lung function or exacerbations. This suggests that the earlier results occurred by chance. There were no deaths and we did not find any differences between ataluren and placebo in side effects or nutritional status. Neither trial reported on hospitalisations, extra courses of antibiotics or cost‐effectiveness. We have not found enough high‐quality evidence to determine the effect of ataluren for treating CF. We recommend that future trials are designed and reported clearly so that their results can be included in a systematic review. What are the limitations of the evidence? We are moderately confident in our findings, but there is some uncertainty due to how widely the results varied between participants. We are satisfied that everyone taking part had an equal chance of being in either group (ataluren or placebo) and that no one could work out which group the next person would be put into (so that healthier people did not receive the treatment and make the results seem better). We believe that the clinicians running the trials and those taking part in the trials did not know which treatment each person was receiving. We have some concerns about the emphasis the investigators of one trial placed on the results of a comparison they had not planned (the use of long‐term inhaled tobramycin). Unfortunately, that trial did not report all its results clearly. Sometimes, the results were reported in a way that meant they could not be used in this review, and sometimes the information was not reported at all. This affected our confidence in the overall results. Trial funding sources Both trials were sponsored by PTC Therapeutics Incorporated, who make ataluren. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the US Food and Drug Administration's Office of Orphan Products Development and the US National Institutes of Health also supported the trials.

SCD can cause severe pain, significant end‐organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Kidney disease is a frequent and potentially severe complication in people with SCD. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function present for more than three months. Sickle cell nephropathy refers to the spectrum of kidney complications in SCD. Glomerular damage is a cause of microalbuminuria and can develop at an early age in children with SCD, with increased prevalence in adulthood. In people with sickle cell nephropathy, outcomes are poor as a result of the progression to proteinuria and chronic kidney insufficiency. Up to 12% of people who develop sickle cell nephropathy will develop end‐stage renal disease. This is an update of a review first published in 2017. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of any intervention for preventing or reducing kidney complications or chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease. Possible interventions include red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), either alone or in combination. Search methods We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, seven other databases, and two other trials registers. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications or CKD in people with SCD. We applied no restrictions related to outcomes examined, language, or publication status. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias, and assessed the certainty of the evidence (GRADE). Main results We included three RCTs with 385 participants. We rated the certainty of the evidence as low to very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology, downgrading for risk of bias concerns, indirectness, and imprecision. Hydroxyurea versus placebo One RCT published in 2011 compared hydroxyurea to placebo in 193 children aged nine to 18 months. We are unsure if hydroxyurea compared to placebo reduces or prevents progression of kidney disease assessed by change in glomerular filtration rate (mean difference (MD) 0.58 mL/min /1.73 m 2 , 95% confidence interval (CI) −14.60 to 15.76; 142 participants; very low certainty). Hydroxyurea compared to placebo may improve the ability to concentrate urine (MD 42.23 mOsm/kg, 95% CI 12.14 to 72.32; 178 participants; low certainty), and may make little or no difference to SCD‐related serious adverse events, including acute chest syndrome (risk ratio (RR) 0.39, 99% CI 0.13 to 1.16; 193 participants; low certainty), painful crisis (RR 0.68, 99% CI 0.45 to 1.02; 193 participants; low certainty); and hospitalisations (RR 0.83, 99% CI 0.68 to 1.01; 193 participants; low certainty). No deaths occurred in either trial arm and the RCT did not report quality of life. Angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors versus placebo One RCT published in 1998 compared an ACEI (captopril) to placebo in 22 adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. We are unsure if captopril compared to placebo reduces proteinuria (MD −49.00 mg/day, 95% CI −124.10 to 26.10; 22 participants; very low certainty). We are unsure if captopril reduces or prevents kidney disease as measured by creatinine clearance; the trial authors stated that creatinine clearance remained constant over six months in both groups, but provided no comparative data (very low certainty). The RCT did not report serious adverse events, all‐cause mortality, or quality of life. Angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors versus vitamin C One RCT published in 2020 compared an ACEI (lisinopril) with vitamin C in 170 children aged one to 18 years with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. It reported no data we could analyse. We are unsure if lisinopril compared to vitamin C reduces proteinuria in this population: the large drop in microalbuminuria in both arms of the trial after only one month on treatment may have been due to an overestimation of microalbuminuria at baseline rather than a true effect. The RCT did not report serious adverse events, all‐cause mortality, or quality of life. Authors' conclusions We are unsure if hydroxyurea improves glomerular filtration rate or reduces hyperfiltration in children aged nine to 18 months, but it may improve their ability to concentrate urine and may make little or no difference to the incidence of acute chest syndrome, painful crises, and hospitalisations. We are unsure if ACEI compared to placebo has any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. We are unsure if ACEI compared to vitamin C has any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in children with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. No RCTs assessed red blood cell transfusions or any combined interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications. Due to lack of evidence, we cannot comment on the management of children aged over 18 months or adults with any known genotype of SCD. We have identified a lack of adequately designed and powered studies, although we found four ongoing trials since the last version of this review. Only one ongoing trial addresses renal function as a primary outcome in the short term, but such interventions have long‐term effects. Trials of hydroxyurea, ACEIs or red blood cell transfusion in older children and adults are urgently needed to determine any effect on prevention or reduction of kidney complications in people with SCD. Plain language summary Interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications in people with sickle cell disease Review question Are there any safe and effective interventions that prevent or reduce kidney complications in people with sickle cell disease (SCD)? Background SCD is a serious inherited blood disorder where the red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body, develop abnormally. Normal red blood cells are flexible and disc‐shaped, but sickled cells are rigid and crescent‐shaped, and stickier than normal red blood cells. This can lead to blockage of blood vessels, resulting in tissue and organ damage and episodes of severe pain. The abnormal cells are fragile and break apart easily, which leads to a decreased number of red blood cells, known as anaemia. Kidney complications can start at an early age in children with SCD and are common in adults with the condition. Kidney complications leading to kidney protein leak and chronic kidney disease can be severe, with serious effects on health. Severe complications include the need for dialysis (a procedure to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys stop working properly) or a kidney transplant. Identifying therapies that can prevent or slow down the decline in kidney function in people with SCD is critical for improving health outcomes. Search date The evidence is current to 22 September 2022. Study characteristics We found three randomised controlled trials, which enroled a total of 385 people. One trial, published in 2011, compared the drug hydroxyurea (which helps to maintain the shape and flexibility of red blood cells), to placebo (dummy treatment) in 193 children aged nine to 18 months. The second trial, published in 1998, compared captopril (a drug used to treat high blood pressure) to placebo in 22 adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria (high levels of protein in the urine). The third trial, published in 2020, compared lisinopril (a drug used to treat high blood pressure) to vitamin C in 170 children aged one to 18 years. Two trials received government funding; it was unclear how the third trial was funded. Key results In children aged nine to 18 months, hydroxyurea may increase the ability to produce normal urine, but we are unsure if it has any effect on the glomerular filtration rate (network of filters in the kidney that filter waste from the blood). Hydroxyurea may make little or no difference to the occurrence of serious complications including acute chest syndrome (pain, cough, fever, low oxygen levels, and abnormal substances in the lungs), painful crises, and hospitalisations. We are unsure if giving captopril to adults with SCD who have normal blood pressure and early signs of kidney damage (microalbuminuria) reduces progression of kidney damage. We are unsure if giving lisinopril to children aged one to 18 years with SCD who have normal blood pressure and early signs of kidney damage (microalbuminuria) reduces progression of kidney damage. No trials reported quality of life. Limitations of the evidence We have little or very little confidence in the evidence because we only found three trials, and they had specific populations (only children or only adults), few participants, and wide variations in results.","8","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Acute Chest Syndrome [chemically induced, complications, drug therapy]; *Anemia, Sickle Cell [complications]; *Kidney Failure, Chronic; Adolescent; Adult; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors [therapeutic use]; Antisickling Agents [therapeutic use]; Ascorbic Acid [therapeutic use]; Captopril [therapeutic use]; Child; Creatinine; Humans; Hydroxyurea [therapeutic use]; Lisinopril [therapeutic use]; Proteinuria [etiology]","10.1002/14651858.CD012380.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012380.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Some people with SCD develop ocular manifestations. Vision‐threatening complications are mainly due to proliferative sickle retinopathy, which is characterised by proliferation of new blood vessels. Laser photocoagulation is widely applicable in proliferative retinopathies. It is important to evaluate the efficacy and safety of laser photocoagulation in the treatment of proliferative sickle retinopathy (PSR) to prevent sight‐threatening complications. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of various techniques of laser photocoagulation therapy in SCD‐related proliferative retinopathy. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group’s Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of last search: 4 July 2022. We also searched the following resources (26 June 2022): Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Literature Database (LILACS); WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platforms (ICTRP); and ClinicalTrials.gov. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing laser photocoagulation to no treatment in children and adults with SCD. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed eligibility and risk of bias of the included trials; we extracted and analysed data, contacting trial authors for additional information. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE criteria. Main results We included three trials (414 eyes of 339 children and adults) comparing the efficacy and safety of laser photocoagulation to no therapy in people with PSR. There were 160 males and 179 females ranging in age from 13 to 67 years. The trials used different laser photocoagulation techniques; one single‐centre trial employed sectoral scatter laser photocoagulation using an argon laser; a two‐centre trial employed feeder vessel coagulation using argon laser in one centre and xenon arc in the second centre; while a third trial employed focal scatter laser photocoagulation using argon laser. The mean follow‐up periods were 21 to 32 months in one trial, 42 to 47 months in a second, and 48 months in the third. Two trials had a high risk of allocation bias due to the randomisation method for participants with bilateral disease; the third trial had an unclear risk of selection bias. One trial was at risk of reporting bias. Given the unit of analysis is the eye rather than the individual, we chose to report the data narratively. Using sectoral scatter laser photocoagulation, one trial (174 eyes) reported no difference between groups for complete regression of PSR: 30.2% in the laser group and 22.4% in the control group. The same trial also reported no difference between groups in the development of new PSR: 34.3% of lasered eyes and 41.3% of control eyes (very low‐certainty evidence). The two‐centre trial using feeder vessel coagulation, only presented data at follow‐up for one centre (mean period of nine years) and reported the development of new sea fan in 48.0% in the treated and 45.0% in the control group; no statistical significance (P = 0.64). A third trial reported regression in 55% of the laser group versus 28.6% of controls and progression of PSR in 10.5% of treated versus 25.7% of control eyes. We graded the evidence for these two primary outcomes as very low‐certainty evidence. The sectoral scatter laser photocoagulation trial reported visual loss in 3.0% of treated eyes (mean follow‐up 47 months) versus 12.0% of controlled eyes (mean follow‐up 42 months) (P = 0.019). The feeder vessel coagulation trial reported visual loss in 1.14% of the laser group and 7.5% of the control group (mean follow‐up 26 months at one site and 32 months in another) (P = 0.07). The focal scatter laser photocoagulation trial (mean follow‐up of four years) reported that 72/73 eyes had the same visual acuity, while visual loss was seen in only one eye from the control group. We graded the certainty of the evidence as very low. The sectoral scatter laser trial detected vitreous haemorrhage in 12.0% of the laser group and 25.3% of control with a mean follow‐up of 42 (control) to 47 months (treated) (P ≤ 0.5). The two‐centre feeder vessel coagulation trial observed vitreous haemorrhage in 3.4% treated eyes (mean follow‐up 26 months) versus 27.5% control eyes (mean follow‐up 32 months); one centre (mean follow‐up nine years) reported vitreous haemorrhage in 1/25 eyes (4.0%) in the treatment group and 9/20 eyes (45.0%) in the control group (P = 0.002). The scatter laser photocoagulation trial reported that vitreous haemorrhage was not seen in the treated group compared to 6/35 (17.1%) eyes in the control group and appeared only in the grades B and (PSR) stage III) (P < 0.05). We graded evidence for this outcome as low‐certainty. Regarding adverse effects, only one occurrence of retinal tear was reported. All three trials reported on retinal detachment, with no significance across the treatment and control groups (low‐certainty evidence). One trial reported on choroidal neovascularization, with treatment with xenon arc found to be associated with a significantly higher risk, but visual loss related to this complication is uncommon with long‐term follow‐up of three years or more. The included trials did not report on other adverse effects or quality of life. Authors' conclusions Our conclusions are based on the data from three trials (two of which were conducted over 30 years ago). Given the limited evidence available, which we assessed to be of low‐ or very low‐certainty, we are uncertain whether laser therapy for sickle cell retinopathy improves the outcomes measured in this review. This treatment does not appear to have an effect on clinical outcomes such as regression of PSR and development of new incidences. No evidence is available assessing efficacy in relation to patient‐important outcomes (such as quality of life or the loss of a driving licence).  Further research is needed to examine the safety of laser treatment compared to other interventions such as intravitreal injection of anti‐vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) . Patient‐important outcomes as well as cost‐effectiveness should be addressed. Plain language summary Laser therapy for retinopathy in sickle cell disease Review question  How effective are the various techniques of laser photocoagulation in sickle cell disease‐related proliferative retinopathy (development of sight‐threatening complications due to excessive growth of blood vessels in the back of the eye)? Background  Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder affecting many organs including the eyes. The back of the eye (retina) can develop problems due to sickle cell disease. A certain number of people with sickle cell disease develop sight‐threatening complications due to excessive blood vessel growth in the retina which is known as proliferative sickle retinopathy. Laser therapy is used to control the growth of new blood vessels in affected eyes. There are different types and techniques of laser used in treatment. However, we do not know whether these various laser treatments offer advantages compared to no treatment or other interventions with regards to effectiveness and safety. Search date  The evidence is current to: 26 June 2022. Trial characteristics  We included three randomised trials (414 eyes, 399 participants), comparing laser treatment to no intervention. There were 160 males and 179 females ranging in age from 13 to 67 years. The trials used different types of laser treatment. One trial applied lasers to the retina near the new blood vessels (sectoral scatter laser treatment) using an argon laser. Another applied lasers directly to feeding blood vessels (feeder vessel laser coagulation) using either xenon arc or argon laser. The third trial used focal scatter laser photocoagulation with an argon laser. Participants were followed up for an average of 21 to 48 months.  Key results  There is low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence on the effects of using laser therapy in people with retinopathy related to sickle cell disease. In one trial, the effect of laser therapy on stopping the progression of new blood vessels and the development of new lesions did not differ greatly between the groups (very low‐certainty evidence). From the evidence found, we are not sure if laser therapy can prevent loss of vision (very low‐certainty evidence), but it may prevent sight‐threatening complications (low‐certainty evidence). The trials did not report on patient‐important outcomes, such as quality of life. Evidence from the three trials showed that the safety of laser treatment is acceptable (few adverse effects), particularly scatter laser treatment using an argon laser. Although xenon arc lasers are linked to a higher number of complications, a loss of vision is not common. However, given that there are few trials with relatively low‐certainty evidence, results should be treated with caution. Further research is needed to examine the safety of laser treatment compared to other interventions. Trials should also measure patient‐important outcomes (such as quality of life and loss of driving licence) as well as cost‐effectiveness. Certainty of the evidence  We thought there was a risk of bias due to the way participants were selected for groups in two trials, especially since treatment may be required for both eyes. We thought there was a risk of bias in one trial which only presented some results for one of the two treatment groups; and we thought a third trial had a risk of bias as it did not clearly state in the Methods section of the paper which outcomes they intended to report.","12","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Anemia, Sickle Cell [complications]; *Choroidal Neovascularization [etiology]; *Laser Therapy [adverse effects]; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Female; Humans; Intravitreal Injections; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Vision Disorders; Young Adult","10.1002/14651858.CD010790.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010790.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD009650.PUB5","Lo, DKH; Muhlebach, MS; Smyth, AR","Interventions for the eradication of meticillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in people with cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2022","Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis is an inherited recessive disorder of chloride transport that is characterised by recurrent and persistent pulmonary infections from resistant organisms that result in lung function deterioration and early mortality in sufferers. Meticillin‐resistant  Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) has emerged not only as an important infection in people who are hospitalised, but also as a potentially harmful pathogen in cystic fibrosis. Chronic pulmonary infection with MRSA is thought to confer on people with cystic fibrosis a worse clinical outcome and result in an increased rate of lung function decline. Clear guidance for MRSA eradication in cystic fibrosis, supported by robust evidence, is urgently needed. This is an update of a previous review. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of treatment regimens designed to eradicate MRSA and to determine whether the eradication of MRSA confers better clinical and microbiological outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis. To ascertain whether attempts at eradicating MRSA can lead to increased acquisition of other resistant organisms (including  Pseudomonas aeruginosa ), increased adverse effects from drugs, or both. Search methods We identified randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials by searching the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders (CFGD) Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, PubMed, MEDLINE and three clinical trials registries; by handsearching article reference lists; and through contact with experts in the field. We last searched the CFGD Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register on 4 October 2021, and the ongoing trials registries on 31 January 2022. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs of any combinations of topical, inhaled, oral or intravenous antimicrobials primarily aimed at eradicating MRSA compared with placebo, standard treatment or no treatment. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and used the GRADE methodology to assess the certainty of the evidence. Main results The review includes three RCTs with 135 participants with MRSA infection. Two trials compared active treatment versus observation only and one trial compared active treatment with placebo.  Active treatment versus observation In both trials (106 participants), active treatment consisted of oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin. One trial administered this combination for two weeks alongside nasal, skin and oral decontamination and a three‐week environmental decontamination, while the second trial administered this drug combination for 21 days with five days intranasal mupirocin. Both trials reported successful eradication of MRSA in people with cystic fibrosis, but they used different definitions of eradication. One trial (45 participants) defined MRSA eradication as negative MRSA respiratory cultures at day 28, and reported that oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin may lead to a higher proportion of negative cultures compared to control (odds ratio (OR) 12.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.84 to 55.84; low‐certainty evidence). However, by day 168 of follow‐up, there was no difference between groups in the proportion of participants who remained MRSA‐negative (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.31 to 4.42; low‐certainty evidence). The second trial defined successful eradication as the absence of MRSA following treatment in at least three cultures over a period of six months. We are uncertain if the intervention led to results favouring the treatment group as the certainty of the evidence was very low (OR 2.74, 95% CI 0.64 to 11.75). There were no differences between groups in the remaining outcomes for this comparison: quality of life, frequency of exacerbations or adverse effects (all low‐certainty evidence) or the change from baseline in lung function or weight (both very low‐certainty evidence). The time until next positive MRSA isolate was not reported. The included trials found no differences between groups in terms of nasal colonisation with MRSA. While not a specific outcome of this review, investigators from one study reported that the rate of hospitalisation from screening through day 168 was lower with oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin compared to control (rate ratio 0.22, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.72; P = 0.01). Nebulised vancomycin with oral antibiotics versus nebulised placebo with oral antibiotics The third trial (29 participants) defined eradication as a negative respiratory sample for MRSA at one month following completion of treatment. No differences were reported in MRSA eradication between treatment arms (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.14 to 7.39; low‐certainty evidence). No differences between groups were seen in lung function or adverse effects (low‐certainty evidence), in quality of life (very low‐certainty evidence) or nasal colonisation with MRSA. The trial did not report on the change in weight or frequency of exacerbations.  Authors' conclusions Early eradication of MRSA is possible in people with cystic fibrosis, with one trial demonstrating superiority of active MRSA treatment compared with observation only in terms of the proportion of MRSA‐negative respiratory cultures at day 28. However, follow‐up at three or six months showed no difference between treatment and control in the proportion of participants remaining MRSA‐negative. Moreover, the longer‐term clinical consequences – in terms of lung function, mortality and cost of care – remain unclear. Using GRADE methodology, we judged the certainty of the evidence provided by this review to be very low to low, due to potential biases from the open‐label design, high rates of attrition and small sample sizes. Based on the available evidence, we believe that whilst early eradication of respiratory MRSA in people with cystic fibrosis is possible, there is not currently enough evidence regarding the clinical outcomes of eradication to support the use of the interventions studied. Plain language summary Treatments to clear the 'superbug' meticillin‐resistant  Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) from the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis Review question We looked for evidence for the effects of different ways of clearing meticillin‐resistant  Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA), a so‐called 'superbug', from the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis. Background MRSA is a type of bacteria resistant to some types of antibiotics (medicines that kill or inhibit bacteria). Because MRSA is hard to treat, it is sometimes called a 'superbug'. Infection with MRSA is particularly worrying for people with cystic fibrosis, an inherited condition which, amongst other things, causes thick mucus to build up in the lungs. It is very difficult for people with cystic fibrosis to cough up this thick mucus, making it an ideal breeding ground for bacteria, including MRSA, and making these people more prone to chest infections. It is thought that MRSA can cause more damage than other bacteria which are not resistant to antibiotics. We wanted to identify research evidence to support the best way for treating MRSA infections and also to see if this treatment would improve the lives of people with cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published review. Search date The evidence is current to 31 January 2022. Key results We found three studies which included 135 people with cystic fibrosis and a diagnosed MRSA infection.  Two studies (106 people) compared treatment given to one group of people versus observation only of a second group of people. In one of these studies, people in the active treatment group were given oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin (all three are antibiotic medicines), plus additional decontamination treatment. In the second trial, people in the active treatment group were given two antibiotics orally (co‐trimoxazole and rifampicin) and one by nose spray (mupirocin). The results of these studies showed that clearing MRSA from the airways of people with cystic fibrosis is possible. In both trials, a larger proportion of those who were treated cleared MRSA. However, some people who were untreated also cleared MRSA spontaneously. Also, six months after treatment, the number of individuals who still had MRSA was not different between those who had received treatment and those who had not. We found no differences between treatment groups in quality of life, frequency of exacerbations (that is, flare‐ups of the disease), unwanted or harmful effects of treatment, nasal colonisation with MRSA, or in changes in lung function or weight. The studies did not report the length of time until finding the next positive MRSA result in participants. In one of the studies, fewer people who were treated with antibiotics were admitted to hospital in the first 168 days.  The third study compared treatment groups who were given either an inhaled antibiotic or an inhaled placebo (inactive substance). Both groups were also given the same oral antibiotics. In this study, there was no difference between groups in MRSA clearance. There were no differences between groups in lung function, quality of life, unwanted or harmful effects or nasal colonisation with MRSA. The trial did not report on change in weight or frequency of exacerbations.  Treating MRSA early in people with cystic fibrosis has been shown to be possible, but it is not clear what longer‐term implications this treatment will have. Main limitations of the evidence We had little or no confidence in the evidence we found for the different outcomes. This was due to potential issues from the study designs, where people knew which treatment each participant was receiving (groups were either given medication or just observed), and because there were small numbers of people in each study.","12","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Cystic Fibrosis [drug therapy]; *Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Anti-Bacterial Agents [therapeutic use]; Humans; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Rifampin [therapeutic use]","10.1002/14651858.CD009650.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009650.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD014606.PUB2","Wong, C-H; Smith, S; Kansra, S","Digital technology for early identification of exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2023","Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life‐limiting genetic condition affecting various organ systems including the gastrointestinal tract, endocrine system and especially the respiratory tract. Pulmonary exacerbations in CF result in increased symptoms, an acceleration in the rate of lung decline and an increased need for treatment. Early detection of infections or clinical worsening provides an opportunity for proactive treatment that may affect clinical outcomes. Objectives To evaluate whether digital technology can effectively predict pulmonary exacerbations to allow earlier intervention and improved health outcomes without increasing the burden of treatment in people with CF. Search methods We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews on 13 October 2022. We searched Embase and the clinical trial registries on 3 January 2023. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs in people with CF looking at whether digital technology can effectively predict pulmonary exacerbations to allow earlier intervention and improved health outcomes without increasing the burden of treatment.  Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. pulmonary exacerbations and 2. quality of life (QoL). Our secondary outcomes were 3. lung function, 4. hospitalisations, 5. intravenous (IV) antibiotics, 6. microbiology, 7. cost‐effectiveness and 8. adverse events. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. Main results We included three studies (415 participants) in people with CF aged 15 to 41 years over a 12‐month period. One was a multicentre RCT, whilst two were single‐centre RCTs.  The three studies were mostly similar in their risk of bias, having low or unclear risk of selection bias but a high risk of detection bias, due to the unblinded design of these studies. The studies used a variety of digital technologies to monitor symptoms such as a digital symptom diary either with or without home spirometry monitoring. As the trials only included adults and older children, we are not certain that the results would apply to younger children. One of our primary outcomes was to assess time to detection of pulmonary exacerbation and number of pulmonary exacerbations identified between the intervention and routine care groups. We were largely unable to pool results in a meta‐analysis due to the variety of methodologies and ways of reporting data. Two studies noted a shorter time to detection of exacerbations in the intervention group and one of these also reported that the intervention group had a shorter time to first exacerbation (hazard ratio for time to first exacerbation 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09 to 1.93), whilst a further study reported a shorter time to detection of exacerbations in the intervention group requiring oral or IV antibiotics compared to the control group (median: 70 (interquartile range (IQR) 123) days with intervention versus 141 (IQR 140) days with control; P = 0.02). However, all three studies were concordant in finding no probable effect on spirometry in the intervention groups when compared with their routine care groups over a 12‐month period.  We found that there is probably no difference between groups with regard to QoL scores across most domains except for Weight and Body Image, which favoured the usual care group. There is also probably no difference in the number of days of additional IV antibiotics needed or newly detected pathogens. No studies reported serious adverse events directly linked to the intervention and one study reported their smartphone application was generally well received. Authors' conclusions Pulmonary exacerbations are universally accepted to be detrimental to progression of CF‐related lung disease, therefore, it is intuitive that early detection and intervention would help to improve outcomes. Digital technology provides an opportunity to detect physiological and symptomatic changes to identify exacerbations early.  Our review found that digital technologies based on recording physiological change (spirometry) and symptoms probably allow earlier identification of exacerbations as a group. However, this may not reduce the number of exacerbations warranting IV antibiotics and there is probably no effect on lung function. This may be partly due to inconsistent definitions of pulmonary exacerbations and discrepancy in the management strategies for pulmonary exacerbations. Overall, the intervention may make little or no difference to QoL scores.  The adherence to and uptake of digital technologies, especially those which include physiological measurements, are not well sustained and the costs of these need to be balanced against the clinical efficacy. Plain language summary Digital technology for early identification of chest infections in people with cystic fibrosis Review question Can digital technology identify chest infections in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) earlier than with standard care and how does this affect clinical outcomes? What is cystic fibrosis? CF is a life‐limiting condition affecting several body organs, especially the lungs. Chest infections can worsen the damage in the lungs of people with CF. Identifying chest infections early and treating them quickly is very important. Digital technology, such as smartphone applications (apps) and devices to measure breathing to track symptoms may allow us to identify chest infections earlier in people with CF and start treatment with antibiotics quicker.  What did we want to find out? We want to know if early identification of chest infections can help slow down how quickly the condition of the lungs worsens.  What did we do? We searched medical databases for well‐designed clinical trials in people with CF. People taking part in the studies had the same chance of being in either the treatment group (who used the digital technology) or the usual care group. What did we find? We found three studies with 415 people with CF aged 15 to 41 years. All the treatment groups used a technology to track their breathing problems, two studies also asked their treatment groups to do regular breathing tests with special devices. All studies followed people in their groups for one year. Key results The studies that asked people to do regular breathing tests with special devices and track breathing problems were able to identify chest infections earlier than people in the usual care groups. However, at the end of the study, their breathing tests were similar to the groups that did not use digital technology.  There were few differences between the groups when we looked at how they felt in their day‐to‐day life (quality of life), the number of hospital visits or costs. People who took part in the studies did not have any serious issues or problems that arose because of the digital technology they were using, but people were generally not very good at providing data regularly, and did find it quite a burden. What are the limitations of the evidence? We can only be moderately sure of these results from the studies we found. In all the studies, the people who took part will have known whether they were in the digital intervention group or the standard care group. This may have affected how they behaved, and what they thought of their breathing problems. In two studies, the teams running the study would have also known which group the person belonged to. This might have affected their choice on whether to start antibiotics, and whether to give the antibiotics by drip into a vein in hospital, or if they could take them as tablets or liquid medicine at home. Two studies did not recruit enough people, so we are less certain about how trustworthy those results are.  Some types of digital technology can detect chest infections sooner. However, when compared to relying on usual care, technology does not seem to change the rate at which the lungs in people with CF worsen over time.

"CD002011.PUB3","Main, E; Rand, S","Conventional chest physiotherapy compared to other airway clearance techniques for cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2023","Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited life‐limiting disorder. Over time persistent infection and inflammation within the lungs contribute to severe airway damage and loss of respiratory function. Chest physiotherapy, or airway clearance techniques (ACTs), are integral in removing airway secretions and initiated shortly after CF diagnosis. Conventional chest physiotherapy (CCPT) generally requires assistance, while alternative ACTs can be self‐administered, facilitating independence and flexibility. This is an updated review. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness (in terms of respiratory function, respiratory exacerbations, exercise capacity) and acceptability (in terms of individual preference, adherence, quality of life) of CCPT for people with CF compared to alternative ACTs. Search methods We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search was 26 June 2022. Selection criteria We included randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials (including cross‐over design) lasting at least seven days and comparing CCPT with alternative ACTs in people with CF. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. pulmonary function tests and 2. number of respiratory exacerbations per year. Our secondary outcomes were 3. quality of life, 4. adherence to therapy, 5. cost–benefit analysis, 6. objective change in exercise capacity, 7. additional lung function tests, 8. ventilation scanning, 9. blood oxygen levels, 10. nutritional status, 11. mortality, 12. mucus transport rate and 13. mucus wet or dry weight. We reported outcomes as short‐term (seven to 20 days), medium‐term (more than 20 days to up to one year) and long‐term (over one year). Main results We included 21 studies (778 participants) comprising seven short‐term, eight medium‐term and six long‐term studies. Studies were conducted in the USA (10), Canada (five), Australia (two), the UK (two), Denmark (one) and Italy (one) with a median of 23 participants per study (range 13 to 166). Participant ages ranged from newborns to 45 years; most studies only recruited children and young people. Sixteen studies reported the sex of participants (375 males; 296 females). Most studies compared modifications of CCPT with a single comparator, but two studies compared three interventions and another compared four interventions. The interventions varied in the duration of treatments, times per day and periods of comparison making meta‐analysis challenging. All evidence was very low certainty. Nineteen studies reported the primary outcomes forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 )and forced vital capacity (FVC), and found no difference in change from baseline in FEV 1  % predicted or rate of decline between groups for either measure. Most studies suggested equivalence between CCPT and alternative ACTs, including positive expiratory pressure (PEP), extrapulmonary mechanical percussion, active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT), oscillating PEP devices (O‐PEP), autogenic drainage (AD) and exercise. Where single studies suggested superiority of one ACT, these findings were not corroborated in similar studies; pooled data generally concluded that effects of CCPT were comparable to those of alternative ACTs. CCPT versus PEP We are uncertain whether CCPT improves lung function or has an impact on the number of respiratory exacerbations per year compared with PEP (both very low‐certainty evidence). There were no analysable data for our secondary outcomes, but many studies provided favourable narrative reports on the independence achieved with PEP mask therapy. CCPT versus extrapulmonary mechanical percussion We are uncertain whether CCPT improves lung function compared with extrapulmonary mechanical percussions (very low‐certainty evidence). The annual rate of decline in average forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of FVC (FEF 25–75 ) was greater with high‐frequency chest compression compared to CCPT in medium‐ to long‐term studies, but there was no difference in any other outcome. CCPT versus ACBT We are uncertain whether CCPT improves lung function compared to ACBT (very low‐certainty evidence). Annual decline in FEF 25–75  was worse in participants using the FET component of ACBT only (mean difference (MD) 6.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 11.45; 1 study, 63 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). One short‐term study reported that directed coughing was as effective as CCPT for all lung function outcomes, but with no analysable data. One study found no difference in hospital admissions and days in hospital for exacerbations. CCPT versus O‐PEP We are uncertain whether CCPT improves lung function compared to O‐PEP devices (Flutter device and intrapulmonary percussive ventilation); however, only one study provided analysable data (very low‐certainty evidence). No study reported data for number of exacerbations. There was no difference in results for number of days in hospital for an exacerbation, number of hospital admissions and number of days of intravenous antibiotics; this was also true for other secondary outcomes. CCPT versus AD We are uncertain whether CCPT improves lung function compared to AD (very low‐certainty evidence). No studies reported the number of exacerbations per year; however, one study reported more hospital admissions for exacerbations in the CCPT group (MD 0.24, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.42; 33 participants). One study provided a narrative report of a preference for AD. CCPT versus exercise We are uncertain whether CCPT improves lung function compared to exercise (very low‐certainty evidence). Analysis of original data from one study demonstrated a higher FEV 1  % predicted (MD 7.05, 95% CI 3.15 to 10.95; P = 0.0004), FVC (MD 7.83, 95% CI 2.48 to 13.18; P = 0.004) and FEF 25–75  (MD 7.05, 95% CI 3.15 to 10.95; P = 0.0004) in the CCPT group; however, the study reported no difference between groups (likely because the original analysis accounted for baseline differences). Authors' conclusions We are uncertain whether CCPT has a more positive impact on respiratory function, respiratory exacerbations, individual preference, adherence, quality of life, exercise capacity and other outcomes when compared to alternative ACTs as the certainty of the evidence is very low. There was no advantage in respiratory function of CCPT over alternative ACTs, but this may reflect insufficient evidence rather than real equivalence. Narrative reports indicated that participants prefer self‐administered ACTs. This review is limited by a paucity of well‐designed, adequately powered, long‐term studies. This review cannot yet recommend any single ACT above others; physiotherapists and people with CF may wish to try different ACTs until they find an ACT that suits them best. Plain language summary Conventional (traditional) chest physiotherapy compared to other methods of airway clearance in people with cystic fibrosis Review question Is conventional chest physiotherapy (CCPT) better than other methods of airway clearance for people with cystic fibrosis (CF)? Key messages Airway clearance techniques (ACTs) are a very important part of therapy in people with CF. There are now lots of different types of ACTs, but there is still very little known about how good each one is and how they compare to each other. The focus of this review was to compare CCPT (also known as traditional chest physiotherapy) with alternative ACTs. What is cystic fibrosis? CF is a life‐limiting inherited disease affecting between 70,000 and 100,000 people worldwide. People with CF produce mucus in their lungs that can be thick, sticky and difficult to clear. This leads to repeated infections and lung damage. It is important to clear this mucus using medicines and various chest physiotherapy ACTs. CCPTs such as postural drainage, percussion and vibration, huffing and coughing have generally required assistance from someone else during treatments. Alternative ACTs such as active cycle of breathing techniques, forced expiration technique, autogenic drainage, positive expiratory pressure devices, oscillating positive expiratory pressure devices (e.g. Acapella, Aerobika, Flutter, RC‐Cornet) or high‐frequency chest compression and exercise are self‐administered, which increases independence and flexibility. What did we want to find out? We wanted to compare how different ACTs affect lung function (how well the lungs work), respiratory exacerbations (flare‐ups of lung disease), a person's preference, adherence (how well the person follows their doctor's advice), quality of life and impact on fitness levels. What did we do? We searched medical databases for well‐designed studies comparing CCPT with other ACTs in people with CF. Studies selected people for one treatment or the other in a random or partly random way. We chose studies lasting longer than one week to allow enough time for treatments to have an impact on the outcomes we were interested in. What did we find? We found 21 studies with 778 people with CF aged from newborn to 45 years and with all levels of disease severity. The number of people included in each study ranged from 13 to 166. There were more females than males included in all but two studies. Main results The studies did not show that any alternative ACTs were better than CCPT in terms of lung function, respiratory exacerbations, a person's preference, adherence, quality of life and impact on fitness level. Studies in which participants had flare‐ups of chest infections showed that lung function improved considerably after treatment, irrespective of the type of ACT. Longer‐term studies showed smaller improvements or a decline in lung function. In 10 studies, participants preferred the chest physiotherapy techniques they could administer themselves, but, since the studies measured preference in different ways, we could not combine the individual study results in an analysis. Side effects from different ACTs tended to be rare, mild and resolved quickly. We cannot recommend any single treatment over another at this time. What are the limitations of the evidence? The quality of evidence varied greatly between the studies. We are not sure that the present evidence is able to answer the questions we were asking. We did not find enough evidence to confirm or exclude any differences between CCPT and alternative ACTs in terms of our outcome measures. Furthermore, data from our included studies did not show that any of the alternative ACTs were better than CCPT in people with CF. This may be because the studies did not report enough data for us to analyse, rather than confirming that the ACTs all worked equally well. There were differences in how the studies were run and how the researchers collected data, so this also makes it difficult to compare results. These differences included the number of people in the studies, length of time the studies lasted, location of the studies (e.g. in hospital or at home), types of ACTs used and outcomes measured by the researchers to assess the impact of the different techniques. In future studies it would be better if these factors were more similar to make it easier to compare results. How up to date is this evidence?

While many bleeding disorders in women tend to improve in pregnancy, thus decreasing the haemorrhagic risk to the mother at the time of delivery, some do not correct or return quite quickly to their pre‐pregnancy levels in the postpartum period. Therefore, specific measures to prevent maternal bleeding and foetal complications during childbirth, are required. The safest method of delivery to reduce morbidity and mortality in these women is controversial. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the optimal mode of delivery in women with, or carriers of, bleeding disorders. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Coagulopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register as well as trials registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search of the Group's Trials Registers: 21 June 2021. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised controlled clinical trials investigating the optimal mode of delivery in women with, or carriers of, any type of bleeding disorder during pregnancy were eligible for the review. Data collection and analysis No trials matching the selection criteria were eligible for inclusion. Main results No trials matching the selection criteria were eligible for inclusion. Authors' conclusions The review did not identify any randomised controlled trials investigating the safest mode of delivery and associated maternal and foetal complications during delivery in women with, or carriers of, a bleeding disorder. In the absence of high quality evidence, clinicians need to use their clinical judgement and lower level evidence (e.g. from observational trials, case studies) to decide upon the optimal mode of delivery to ensure the safety of both mother and foetus. Given the ethical considerations, the rarity of the disorders and the low incidence of both maternal and foetal complications, future randomised controlled trials to find the optimal mode of delivery in this population are unlikely to be carried out. Other high quality controlled studies (such as risk allocation designs, sequential design, and parallel cohort design) are needed to investigate the risks and benefits of natural vaginal and caesarean section in this population or extrapolation from other clinical conditions that incur a haemorrhagic risk to the baby, such as platelet alloimmunisation. Plain language summary Mother and baby outcomes following normal delivery and caesarean (c‐section) delivery in women with bleeding disorders and carriers Review question We looked at the evidence on mother and baby outcomes following natural vaginal delivery and caesarean (c‐section) section in women with bleeding disorders and carriers.

Background We wanted to review the safest way to deliver babies in women with bleeding disorders and carriers and assess problems that may occur during delivery for the mother and baby with either method of delivery. Search date The evidence is current to: 21 June 2021. Key results We did not find any randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials to analyse the safest way (either natural vaginal delivery or c‐section) to deliver babies and problems encountered during delivery to mothers and babies in this population. Given the rarity of the disorders and the challenge of performing trials in pregnancy, it is unlikely that randomised controlled trials will be carried out in the future. Therefore, clinicians will need to make decisions regarding treatment using lower level evidence.","12","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Blood Coagulation Disorders; *Labor, Obstetric; *Pregnancy Complications, Hematologic; Cesarean Section; Female; Fetus; Humans; Infant; Pregnancy","10.1002/14651858.CD011059.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011059.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Chronic infection by  Burkholderia cepacia  complex (BCC) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and therefore represents a significant challenge to clinicians treating people with CF. This review examines the current evidence for long‐term antibiotic therapy in people with CF and chronic BCC infection. Objectives The objective of this review is to assess the effects of long‐term oral and inhaled antibiotic therapy targeted against chronic BCC lung infections in people with CF. The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of treatments in terms of improvements in lung function and reductions in exacerbation rate. Secondary objectives include quantifying adverse events, mortality and changes in quality of life associated with treatment. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched online trial registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 12 April 2021. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of long‐term antibiotic therapy in people with CF and chronic BCC infection. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias and assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. Main results We included one RCT (100 participants) which lasted 52 weeks comparing continuous inhaled aztreonam lysine (AZLI) and placebo in a double‐blind RCT for 24 weeks, followed by a 24‐week open‐label extension and a four‐week follow‐up period. The average participant age was 26.3 years, 61% were male and average lung function was 56.5% predicted. Treatment with AZLI for 24 weeks was not associated with improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ), mean difference 0.91% (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐3.15 to 4.97) (moderate‐quality evidence). The median time to the next exacerbation was 75 days in the AZLI group compared to 51 days in the placebo group, but the difference was not significant (P = 0.27) (moderate‐quality evidence). Similarly, the number of participants hospitalised for respiratory exacerbations showed no difference between groups, risk ratio (RR) 0.88 (95% CI 0.53 to 1.45) (moderate‐quality evidence). Overall adverse events were similar between groups, RR 1.08 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.19) (moderate‐quality evidence). There were no significant differences between treatment groups in relation to mortality (moderate‐quality evidence), quality of life or sputum density. In relation to methodological quality, the overall risk of bias in the study was assessed to be unclear to low risk. Authors' conclusions We found insufficient evidence from the literature to determine an effective strategy for antibiotic therapy for treating chronic BCC infection. Plain language summary Antibiotic treatments for long‐term  Burkholderia cepacia  infections in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence for long‐term antibiotic treatments for people with cystic fibrosis who are infected with  Burkholderia cepacia  complex (bacteria composed of at least 20 different species). Background People with cystic fibrosis often suffer from repeated chest infections and eventually their lungs become permanently infected by bacteria, such as a family of bacteria called  Burkholderia cepacia  complex which can cause problems because many antibiotics do not work against them and they can cause a quicker deterioration in lung disease. We wanted to discover whether using long‐term antibiotic treatment was beneficial for people with cystic fibrosis and  Burkholderia cepacia  complex infection. Search date The evidence is current to: 12 April 2021. Study characteristics This review included one study of 100 people aged between 6 and 57 years old. The study compared an inhaled antibiotic called aztreonam to placebo (a substance which contains no medication) and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly (by chance). The study lasted 52 weeks. Key results The only study included in this review found inhaled aztreonam had no beneficial effect on lung function or rates of chest infections in people with cystic fibrosis and  Burkholderia cepacia  complex infection. There was no difference between groups in relation to the average time to the next exacerbation or the number of people hospitalised for an exacerbation. Overall adverse events were similar between groups and with regards to other outcomes assessed, there was no difference between treatment groups for mortality, quality of life or sputum density. More research is needed to establish if other inhaled antibiotics may be useful. Quality of the evidence Overall quality of evidence was considered to be moderate across all outcomes, which means further research is likely to have an important impact on results.","12","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Burkholderia cepacia; *Cystic Fibrosis [complications, drug therapy]; Adult; Anti-Bacterial Agents [adverse effects]; Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator; Humans; Male; Persistent Infection; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD013079.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013079.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD009595.PUB3","Burnham, P; Stanford, G; Stewart, R","Autogenic drainage for airway clearance in cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2021","Abstract - Background Autogenic drainage is an airway clearance technique that was developed by Jean Chevaillier in 1967. The technique is characterised by breathing control using expiratory airflow to mobilise secretions from smaller to larger airways. Secretions are cleared independently by adjusting the depth and speed of respiration in a sequence of controlled breathing techniques during exhalation. The technique requires training, concentration and effort from the individual but it has previously been shown to be an effective treatment option for those who are seeking techniques to support and promote independence.  However, at a time where the trajectory and demographics of the disease are changing, it is important to systematically review the evidence demonstrating that autogenic drainage is an effective intervention for people with cystic fibrosis. Objectives To compare the clinical effectiveness of autogenic drainage in people with cystic fibrosis with other physiotherapy airway clearance techniques. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews, as well as two ongoing trials registers (02 February 2021). Date of most recent search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 06 July 2021. Selection criteria We identified randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled studies comparing autogenic drainage to another airway clearance technique or no therapy in people with cystic fibrosis for at least two treatment sessions. Data collection and analysis Data extraction and assessments of risk of bias were independently performed by three authors. The authors assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE system. The authors contacted seven teams of investigators for further information pertinent to their published studies. Main results Searches retrieved 64 references to 37 individual studies, of which eight (n = 212) were eligible for inclusion. One study was of parallel design with the remaining seven being cross‐over in design; participant numbers ranged from 4 to 75. The total study duration varied between four days and two years. The age of participants ranged between seven and 63 years with a wide range of disease severity reported. Six studies enrolled participants who were clinically stable, whilst participants in two studies received treatment whilst hospitalised with an infective exacerbation. All studies compared autogenic drainage to one (or more) other recognised airway clearance technique. Exercise is commonly used as an alternative therapy by people with cystic fibrosis; however, there were no studies identified comparing exercise with autogenic drainage. The certainty of the evidence was generally low or very low. The main reasons for downgrading the level of evidence were the frequent use of a cross‐over design, outcome reporting bias and the inability to blind participants. The review's primary outcome, forced expiratory volume in one second, was the most common outcome measured and was reported by all eight studies; only three studies reported on quality of life (also a primary outcome of the review). One study reported on adverse events and described a decrease in oxygen saturation levels whilst performing active cycle of breathing techniques, but not with autogenic drainage. Seven of the eight included studies measured forced vital capacity and three of the studies used mid peak expiratory flow (per cent predicted) as an outcome. Six studies reported sputum weight. Less commonly used outcomes included oxygen saturation levels, personal preference, hospital admissions, intravenous antibiotics and pseudomonas gene expression. There were no statistically significant differences found between any of the techniques used with respect to the outcomes measured except when autogenic drainage was described as being the preferred technique of the participants in one study over postural drainage and percussion. Authors' conclusions Autogenic drainage is a challenging technique that requires commitment from the individual. As such, this intervention merits systematic review to ensure its effectiveness for people with cystic fibrosis, particularly in an era where treatment options are changing rapidly. From the studies assessed, autogenic drainage was not found to be superior to any other form of airway clearance technique. Larger studies are required to better evaluate autogenic drainage in comparison to other airway clearance techniques in view of the relatively small number of participants in this review and the complex study designs. The studies recruited a range of participants and were not powered to assess non‐inferiority. The varied length and design of the studies made the analysis of pooled data challenging. Plain language summary The autogenic drainage breathing technique for helping people with cystic fibrosis to clear mucus from their airways Background Cystic fibrosis affects the lungs by producing thick mucus lining the airways. This can lead to infection and inflammation causing lung damage. Physiotherapy can help to keep the airways clear of mucus and there are many methods used to do this including breathing techniques, manual techniques and mechanical devices. Autogenic drainage is a very controlled technique of breathing which uses different depths and speeds of exhaled breath to move mucus up the airways resulting in a spontaneous or voluntary cough. It can be used without help, but requires training, concentration and effort. We looked at the effect of using autogenic drainage on lung function measurements and quality of life in people with cystic fibrosis, to discover whether using autogenic drainage was better or worse than other existing physiotherapy techniques for clearing the lungs. Search date The evidence is current to: 06 July 2021. Study characteristics We searched the literature for studies comparing at least two sessions of autogenic drainage with other breathing techniques and devices which help to clear the lungs of mucus. We included eight studies in the review involving 212 people with cystic fibrosis, aged between seven and 63 years of age .  People were randomly selected for one physiotherapy treatment or the other. The number of people in the studies ranged from 4 to 75, and had a wide range of disease severity. The studies lasted from four days to two years in total. Key results We did not find any clear evidence that autogenic drainage was better than the other techniques for lung function or quality of life in either the short‐term or long‐term studies. This was also true for our other outcome measures such as hospital admissions, additional antibiotic treatment, exercise tolerance and oxygen saturation, but people in one study autogenic drainage preferred autogenic drainage compared to postural drainage and percussion. The authors of this review wanted to compare exercise to autogenic drainage for airway clearance, but found no studies with this comparison, even though exercise is often used as an alternative by people with cystic fibrosis. Certainty of the evidence Overall, the certainty of the evidence from the studies was judged to be mainly low or very low. The main problems for this being the small numbers of participants in each study, the unclear reporting of results in the studies and the study design used. In one study, which was classed as having a high risk of bias due to incomplete results, those taking part had to change physiotherapy technique halfway through the study and there were many who dropped out and did not comply with the postural drainage and percussion treatment arm.  Six of the eight studies used research staff to assess results who did not know which technique each person was using and this improved the quality of the evidence and reduced any bias in this respect.","12","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Cystic Fibrosis [therapy]; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Drainage, Postural; Humans; Middle Aged; Oxygen Saturation; Physical Therapy Modalities; Quality of Life; Young Adult","10.1002/14651858.CD009595.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009595.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Established diagnostic criteria in current clinical practice are the Simon‐Broome and Dutch Lipid Clinical network criteria and patients are classified as having probable, possible or definite familial hypercholesterolaemia. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of healthcare interventions strategies to systematically improve identification of familial hypercholesterolaemia in primary care and other community settings compared to usual care (incidental approaches to identify familial hypercholesterolaemia in primary care and other community settings).

Selection criteria As per the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group guidelines, we planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs and non‐randomised studies of interventions (NRSI). Eligible NRSI were non‐randomised controlled trials, prospective cohort studies, controlled before‐and‐after studies, and interrupted‐time‐series studies. We planned to selected studies with healthcare interventions strategies that aimed to systematically identify people with possible or definite clinical familial hypercholesterolaemia, in primary care and other community settings. These strategies would be compared with usual care or no intervention. We considered participants of any age from the general population who access primary care and other community settings. Data collection and analysis Two authors planned to independently select studies according to the inclusion criteria, to extract data and assess for risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence (according to the GRADE criteria). We contacted corresponding study authors in order to obtain further information for all the studies considered in the review. Main results No eligible RCTs or NRSIs were identified for inclusion, however, we excluded 28 studies.

Uncontrolled before‐and‐after studies were identified, but were not eligible for inclusion. Further studies assessing healthcare strategies of systematic identification of familial hypercholesterolaemia need to be conducted with diagnosis confirmed by genetic testing or validated through clinical phenotype (or both). Plain language summary Healthcare strategies for identifying possible or definite clinical familial hypercholesterolaemia in primary care and other community settings Background One of the most common inherited conditions is familial hypercholesterolaemia, people with this condition have raised cholesterol from birth. This condition can result in the arteries being narrowed by excess cholesterol sticking to their walls and can lead to heart disease at an early age. However, treatment with cholesterol‐lowering tablets markedly reduces this risk. As well as raised cholesterol in the blood, family history of heart disease and the presence of fatty lumps under the skin could indicate familial hypercholesterolaemia. It is important that community‐based health professionals, such as general practitioners and community pharmacists, can identify those at risk of possible or probable familial hypercholesterolaemia and refer them to a specialist. Specialists can confirm a diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolaemia through examination and a genetic test. This review explores the impact of these healthcare strategies in primary care and other community settings to systematically identify people with possible and definite clinical familial hypercholesterolaemia. Search date 13 September 2021.   Study characteristics We did not find any studies that we could include in this review. Key results There were no studies eligible for inclusion in the review. Quality of evidence There were no studies included in the review. Conclusions Currently, there is a lack of evidence regarding the most appropriate healthcare strategy to identify possible or definite clinical familial hypercholesterolaemia in primary care and other community settings. Better‐designed studies, with diagnosis of definite familial hypercholesterolaemia confirmed by genetic tests, are needed to clearly answer this question.","10","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II [diagnosis, genetics, therapy]; Bias; Humans; Interrupted Time Series Analysis; Primary Health Care","10.1002/14651858.CD012985.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012985.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Some clinical trials suggest that combining recombinant human growth hormone therapy with conventional treatment improves growth velocity, phosphate retention, and bone mineral density, but some clinical trials suggest that it appears to aggravate the pre‐existent disproportionate stature of such children. This is an updated version of a previously published review. Objectives To determine whether recombinant human growth hormone therapy for children with X‐linked hypophosphatemia is associated with changes in longitudinal growth, mineral metabolism, endocrine function, renal function, bone mineral density, body proportions, and also with any adverse effects. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE and the reference lists of identified trials and other reviews. We also undertook some additional handsearching of relevant journals and conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 12 January 2021 Selection criteria All randomized controlled studies or quasi‐randomized controlled studies comparing growth hormone (alone or combined with conventional treatment) with either placebo or conventional treatment alone in children with X‐linked hypophosphatemia. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed studies for risk of bias and extracted data from eligible studies. GRADE criteria were used to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Main results We included two studies (20 participants) in the review. In one cross‐over study, results showed that recombinant human growth hormone therapy may improve the height standard deviation (SDS) score (z score), but we are unsure whether the intervention was the reason behind a transient increase in serum phosphate and tubular maximum for phosphate reabsorption. In the second, parallel study, treatment may also have improved the height SDS from baseline in the rhGH group compared to the control group, although no significant difference was seen between groups after three years, MD 0.50 SDS (95 % CI ‐0.54 to 1.54) (low‐certainty evidence). The treatment was possibly well‐tolerated during both studies with only transient adverse effects seen in three participants (low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether growth hormone improves serum phosphate levels or change in TmP/GFR (very low‐certainty evidence). The treatment may make little or no difference to alkaline phosphatase levels (low‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions We do not have enough high‐certainty evidence to recommend the use of recombinant human growth hormone therapy in children with X‐linked hypophosphatemia. Plain language summary Synthetic human growth hormone for treating X‐linked hypophosphatemia (or vitamin D‐resistant rickets) in children Review question Can human growth hormone lead to improved clinical outcomes (such as increased growth and bone mineral density, as well as better kidney and hormone function) without side effects in children with X‐linked hypophosphataemia? Background X‐linked hypophosphataemia is a genetic disorder which causes abnormal levels of phosphate in the body. This can lead to short stature and rickets. Standard treatment of X‐linked hypophosphatemia can heal rickets, but does not always raise the level of phosphates in the blood or return growth levels to normal. It is unclear whether combining human growth hormone therapy with standard treatment improves the phosphate levels, growth rates and bone mineral density. Search date The evidence is current to: 12 January 2021 Study characteristics We included two small studies with a total of 20 children aged between 2.5 and nine years old in this review.  There were equal numbers of boys and girls. Both trials were randomised so that participants had an equal chance of being put in the growth hormone group or the control group (children in the control group either got no additional treatment or a placebo (sham) treatment). One (parallel) trial compared children given the growth hormone to children who did not have any treatment for three years. The second trial was a cross‐over trial, so to start with one group of children were given human growth hormone therapy and the second group were given a placebo for a year and then the groups were given the opposite treatment for a further year. Results The parallel trial found no difference in height scores after treatment with growth hormone compared to no additional treatment. No serious side effects were seen in either of the trials. In the cross‐over trial, human growth hormone therapy improved the height standard deviation score (z score), and temporarily increased blood phosphate levels.  We found no conclusive evidence that shows that human growth hormone treatment works for this condition. There have not been enough studies of human growth hormone treatment for this condition and more research is needed. This is an updated version of a previously published review. Quality of the evidence We mostly graded the certainty of the evidence as low or very low. This was because the trials were very small and only included a few children. We were also concerned that there might have been some bias in the results because of the design of the smaller cross‐over trial.","10","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Familial Hypophosphatemic Rickets [drug therapy]; *Human Growth Hormone [therapeutic use]; Body Height; Child; Cross-Over Studies; Growth Hormone; Humans","10.1002/14651858.CD004447.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004447.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Carrier screening or testing is one way to identify couples at increased risk of having a child with an autosomal recessive condition. The most common autosomal recessive conditions are thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay‐Sachs disease, with higher carrier rates in high‐risk populations of specific ancestral backgrounds. Identifying and counselling couples at genetic risk of the conditions before pregnancy enables them to make fully informed reproductive decisions, with some of these choices not being available if testing is only offered in an antenatal setting. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of systematic preconception genetic risk assessment to enable autonomous reproductive choice and to improve reproductive outcomes  in women and their partners who are both identified as carriers of thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay‐Sachs disease in healthcare settings when compared to usual care. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Registers. Date of latest search of the registers: 04 August 2021. In addition, we searched for all relevant trials from 1970 (or the date at which the database was first available if after 1970) to date using electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO), clinical trial databases (National Institutes of Health, Clinical Trials Search portal of the World Health Organization, metaRegister of controlled clinical trials), and hand searching of key journals and conference abstract books from 1998 to date ( European Journal of Human Genetics, Genetics in Medicine, Journal of Community Genetics ). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles, reviews and guidelines and also contacted subject experts in the field to request any unpublished or other published trials. Date of latest search of all these sources: 25 June 2021.  Selection criteria Any randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs (published or unpublished) comparing reproductive outcomes of systematic preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay‐Sachs disease when compared to usual care. Data collection and analysis We identified 37 papers, describing 22 unique trials which were potentially eligible for inclusion in the review. However, after assessment, we found no RCTs of preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay‐Sachs disease. Main results No RCTs of preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay‐Sachs disease are included. A trial identified earlier has published its results and has subsequently been listed as excluded in this review. Authors' conclusions As there are no RCTs of preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, or Tay‐Sachs disease included in either the earlier or current versions of this review, we recommend considering potential non‐RCTs studies (for example prospective cohorts or before‐and‐after studies) for future reviews. While RCTs are desirable to inform evidence‐based practice and robust recommendations, the ethical, legal and social implications associated with using this trial design to evaluate the implementation of preconception genetic risk assessment involving carrier testing and reproductive autonomy must also be considered.  In addition, rather than focusing on single gene‐by‐gene carrier testing for specific autosomal‐recessive conditions as the intervention being evaluated, preconception expanded genetic screening should also be included in future searches as this has received much attention in recent years as a more pragmatic strategy. The research evidence for current international policy recommendations is limited to non‐randomised studies. Plain language summary Identifying carrier status for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, or Tay‐Sachs disease in non‐pregnant women and their partners Review question We looked for evidence to show whether identifying people who are carriers for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, or Tay‐Sachs disease, before pregnancy leads to improving reproductive choice and pregnancy outcomes. Background Across the world, about 6% of children are born with a birth defect of genetic or partially genetic origin.  Many of these conditions can be passed down from parent to child. There are tests to identify the genetic risk of the most common genetic conditions (thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, or Tay‐Sachs disease) before pregnancy. In these conditions, called autosomal recessive conditions, the parents of affected children are 'carriers' of the condition, which means they do not usually have symptoms. All 'carrier' couples will have a 25% chance of having an affected child. Risk assessment for these genetic conditions before getting pregnant would benefit potential parents who may be carriers. This information would give the at‐risk couple the opportunity to make fully informed decisions about family planning. However, genetic risk assessment before pregnancy may potentially have a negative psychological impact. This is an updated version of the original review. Search date We last looked for evidence on 04 August 2021. Study characteristics We did not find any trials that we could include in this review. In an earlier version of this review, we had already found the protocol for a trial that has now published its results, but we have excluded the trial in this version of the review because it did not look at the right topic after all. Key results Although no trials were identified in which people taking part would have equal chances of being in either group, there are several studies which are not so strictly designed which support current policy recommendations for genetic risk assessment prior to pregnancy in routine clinical practice. We recommend considering potential observational studies in future reviews as well as looking at ‘expanded carrier screening’ before pregnancy and not just screening for one condition. Any future trials need to consider legal, ethical and cultural barriers to implementing genetic risk assessment before pregnancy.","10","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Anemia, Sickle Cell [genetics]; *Cystic Fibrosis [genetics]; *Tay-Sachs Disease [genetics]; *Thalassemia; Female; Humans; Risk Assessment","10.1002/14651858.CD010849.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010849.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Dietary advice (DA) encouraging consumption of energy‐ and nutrient‐rich foods rather than oral nutritional supplements (ONS) may be an initial treatment. Objectives To examine evidence that DA with/without ONS in adults with disease‐related malnutrition improves survival, weight, anthropometry and quality of life (QoL). Search methods We identified relevant publications from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching. Last search: 01 March 2021. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of DA with/without ONS in adults with disease‐related malnutrition in any healthcare setting compared with no advice, ONS or DA alone. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed study eligibility, risk of bias, extracted data and graded evidence. Main results We included 94, mostly parallel, RCTs (102 comparisons; 10,284 adults) across many conditions possibly explaining the high heterogeneity.  Participants were mostly older people in hospital, residential care and the community, with limited reporting on their sex. Studies lasted from one month to 6.5 years.  DA versus no advice ‐ 24 RCTs (3523 participants) Most outcomes had low‐certainty evidence. There may be little or no effect on mortality after three months, RR 0.87 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 2.96), or at later time points. We had no three‐month data, but advice may make little or no difference to hospitalisations, or days in hospital after four to six months and up to 12 months. A similar effect was seen for complications at up to three months, MD 0.00 (95% CI ‐0.32 to 0.32) and between four and six months. Advice may improve weight after three months, MD 0.97 kg (95% CI 0.06 to 1.87) continuing at four to six months and up to 12 months; and may result in a greater gain in fat‐free mass (FFM) after 12 months, but not earlier. It may also improve global QoL at up to three months, MD 3.30 (95% CI 1.47 to 5.13), but not later. DA versus ONS ‐ 12 RCTs (852 participants) All outcomes had low‐certainty evidence. There may be little or no effect on mortality after three months, RR 0.66 (95% CI 0.34 to 1.26), or at later time points. Either intervention may make little or no difference to hospitalisations at three months, RR 0.36 (95% CI 0.04 to 3.24), but ONS may reduce hospitalisations up to six months. There was little or no difference between groups in weight change at three months, MD ‐0.14 kg (95% CI ‐2.01 to 1.74), or between four to six months. Advice (one study) may lead to better global QoL scores but only after 12 months. No study reported days in hospital, complications or FFM. DA versus DA plus ONS ‐ 22 RCTs (1286 participants) Most outcomes had low‐certainty evidence. There may be little or no effect on mortality after three months, RR 0.92 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.80) or at later time points. At three months advice may lead to fewer hospitalisations, RR 1.70 (95% CI 1.04 to 2.77), but not at up to six months. There may be little or no effect on length of hospital stay at up to three months, MD ‐1.07 (95% CI ‐4.10 to 1.97). At three months DA plus ONS may lead to fewer complications, RR 0.75 (95% CI o.56 to 0.99); greater weight gain, MD 1.15 kg (95% CI 0.42 to 1.87); and better global QoL scores, MD 0.33 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.57), but this was not seen at other time points. There was no effect on FFM at three months. DA plus ONS if required versus no advice or ONS ‐ 31 RCTs (3308 participants) Evidence was moderate‐ to low‐certainty. There may be little or no effect on mortality at three months, RR 0.82 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.16) or at later time points. Similarly, little or no effect on hospitalisations at three months, RR 0.83 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.15), at four to six months and up to 12 months; on days in hospital at three months, MD ‐0.12 (95% CI ‐2.48 to 2.25) or for complications at any time point. At three months, advice plus ONS probably improve weight, MD 1.25 kg (95% CI 0.73 to 1.76) and may improve FFM, 0.82 (95% CI 0.35 to 1.29), but these effects were not seen later. There may be little or no effect of either intervention on global QoL scores at three months, but advice plus ONS may improve scores at up to 12 months. DA plus ONS versus no advice or ONS ‐ 13 RCTs (1315 participants) Evidence was low‐ to very low‐certainty. There may be little or no effect on mortality after three months, RR 0.91 (95% CI 0.55 to 1.52) or at later time points. No study reported hospitalisations and there may be little or no effect on days in hospital after three months, MD ‐1.81 (95% CI ‐3.65 to 0.04) or six months. Advice plus ONS may lead to fewer complications up to three months, MD 0.42 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.89) (one study). Interventions may make little or no difference to weight at three months, MD 1.08 kg (95% CI ‐0.17 to 2.33); however, advice plus ONS may improve weight at four to six months and up to 12 months. Interventions may make little or no difference in FFM or global QoL scores at any time point. Authors' conclusions We found no evidence of an effect of any intervention on mortality. There may be weight gain with DA and with DA plus ONS in the short term, but the benefits of DA when compared with ONS are uncertain. The size and direction of effect and the length of intervention and follow‐up required for benefits to emerge were inconsistent for all other outcomes.  There were too few data for many outcomes to allow meaningful conclusions. Studies focusing on both patient‐centred and healthcare outcomes are needed to address the questions in this review. Plain language summary Advice on diet for adults with malnutrition that is the result of disease Review question Can dietary advice with or without oral nutritional supplements (ONS) improve disease‐related malnutrition in adults? Background Ill people often have a poor appetite or feel sick because of medicines or other treatments and eat less than usual. Eating less over a longer time can cause weight loss, malnutrition, more health problems and death. Healthcare professionals may offer advice about dietary changes to help people to re‐establish good eating habits. They might recommend high‐protein and high‐energy foods so that these people can gain weight and improve their nutrition and general health. It is common for sick people to be offered ONS with or without advice about changing their food intake. To find the best answer to our review question, we looked for studies that compared five different treatment options: dietary advice compared with no advice; dietary advice compared with ONS; dietary advice plus ONS compared with dietary advice; dietary advice plus ONS if appropriate compared with no dietary advice; and dietary advice plus ONS compared with no dietary advice and no ONS. To make these comparisons fair, we looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), where the people taking part had an equal chance (like the flip of a coin) of being in either group that was being compared.  Search date The evidence is current to: 01 March 2021. Study characteristics We found 94 studies (with a total of 10,284 people) that we could include in our review. Although older people have a higher risk of malnutrition, the people in these studies ranged from 17 to over 80 years of age and they were living either at home, in the community, or in hospital. They had a wide range of health conditions, including cancer, dementia and kidney disease. The studies reported on the participants for the length of their hospital stay or in some people in the community for up to six and a half years. Key results There is no evidence that any of the treatments affected how long many of the people in the studies lived. They did report some positive changes in energy intake (measured in calories), protein intake, weight, muscle bulk and quality of life. There were some reductions in complications and the length of time spent in hospital. However, there is no clear evidence about which treatment is the most helpful or the time it takes to achieve any benefit. Few studies reported results separately for men and women and so we cannot comment on whether there were any overall differences by sex. No studies recorded information about adverse events (harms) so we cannot offer a summary about possible harms. More research is needed to work out the best ways to help people who are losing weight because of illness in order to improve their clinical outcomes and quality of life. Certainty of the evidence Overall we rated the certainty of the evidence as low for most results, which means that we cannot be confident about the findings we report. There were several reasons for this. Some of the treatment comparisons that we looked at had only a few studies  and some of those had small numbers of participants. There were problems with the design of some studies that may have affected the results. Some people knew which treatment they were receiving. We think this may influence the way that they reported some changes, e.g. their energy and protein intake, body weight and quality of life. We think that the way the decision about which group a person went into at the start of the study may have affected the  results for some outcomes, e.g. change in weight, change in muscle bulk and mortality. We needed to see particular results to help us understand whether adults living with disease‐related malnutrition can improve their survival, weight and general quality of life if they receive advice about diet with or without ONS. None of the studies reported all of the results that we needed to do this. We were not able to estimate whether participants gain any benefits from the treatments, such as shortening the length of hospital stay, lowering the risk of readmission to hospital or developing complications. The low certainty of evidence, with no evidence in many areas, means we cannot  make statements about any benefits and the possible disadvantages of these treatments despite the fact they are being used extensively in clinical practice. We recommend that future studies should be designed to measure these important patient‐centred and healthcare outcomes as well as any potential harms.","12","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Malnutrition [etiology]; *Nutrition Therapy; Adult; Aged; Counseling; Humans; Quality of Life; Weight Gain","10.1002/14651858.CD002008.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002008.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD009191.PUB4","Sasongko, TH; Nagalla, S","Angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for proteinuria and microalbuminuria in people with sickle cell disease","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2021","Abstract - Background Sickle cell disease is a group of disorders characterized by deformation of erythrocytes. Renal damage is a frequent complication in sickle cell disease as a result of long‐standing anemia and disturbed circulation through the renal medullary capillaries. Due to the improvement in life expectancy of people with sickle cell disease, there has been a corresponding significant increase in the incidence of renal complications. Microalbuminuria and proteinuria are noted to be a strong predictor of subsequent renal failure. There is extensive experience and evidence with angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors over many years in a variety of clinical situations for patients who do not have sickle cell disease, but their effect in people with this disease is unknown. It is common practice to administer ACE inhibitors for sickle nephropathy due to their renoprotective properties; however, little is known about their effectiveness and safety in this setting. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2013 and 2015. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of ACE inhibitor administration in people with sickle cell disease for decreasing intraglomerular pressure, microalbuminuria and proteinuria and to to assess the safety of ACE inhibitors as pertains to their adverse effects. Search methods The authors searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Hameoglobinopathies Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 18 October 2021. We also searched clinical trial registries. Date of the most recent search: 22 August 2021. Selection criteria Randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled trials of ACE inhibitors designed to reduce microalbuminuria and proteinuria in people with sickle cell disease compared to either placebo or standard treatment regimen. Data collection and analysis Three authors independently applied the inclusion criteria in order to select studies for inclusion in the review. Two authors assessed the risk of bias of studies and extracted data and the third author verified these assessments. Main results Seven studies were identified through the searches. Six studies were excluded. The included study randomized 22 participants (7 males and 15 females) having proteinuria or microalbuminuria with sickle cell disease and treated the participants for six months (median length of follow up of three months) with captopril or placebo. Overall, the certainty of the evidence provided in this review was very low, since most risk of bias domains were judged to have either an unclear or a high risk of bias. Because of this, we are uncertain whether captopril makes any difference, in total urinary albumin excretion (at six months) as compared to the placebo group, although it yielded a mean difference of ‐49.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐124.10 to 26.10) or in the absolute change score, although it yielded a mean difference of ‐63.00 (95% CI ‐93.78 to ‐32.22). At six months albumin excretion in the captopril group was noted to decrease from baseline by a mean (standard deviation) of 45 (23) mg/day and the placebo group was noted to increase by 18 (45) mg/day. Serum creatinine and potassium levels were reported constant throughout the study (very low‐certainty evidence). The potential for inducing hypotension should be highlighted; the study reported a decrease of 8 mmHg in systolic pressure and 5 mmHg in diastolic and mean blood pressure (very low‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions Overall, we judged the certainty of the evidence to be very low. The included study selectively reported its results, was not powered to detect a group difference, should it exist, and otherwise did not offer enough information to allow us to judge the bias inherent in the study. Indirectness (in relation to the limited age and type of population included) and imprecision (wide confidence intervals around the effect estimate) were observed. More long‐term studies involving multiple centers and larger cohorts using a randomized‐controlled design are warranted, especially among the pediatric age group. Detailed reporting of each outcome measure is necessary to allow a clear cut interpretation in a systematic review. One of the difficulties encountered in this review was the lack of detailed data reported in the included study. Overall, we judged the certainty of this evidence to be very low. Plain language summary Drugs that aim to prevent the loss of protein or albumin through urine in people with sickle cell disease Review question We reviewed the evidence on the effect of drugs that aim to prevent people with sickle cell disease losing protein or albumin (a protein made in the liver) in their urine. Background Sickle cell disease is a group of inherited conditions that often lead to kidney damage. High protein or albumin levels in urine is a strong predictor of future kidney failure. Angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are often given to reduce the level of protein or albumin in urine and to protect the kidneys from damage. However, we do not know very much about how effective and safe these are in people with sickle cell disease. Search date The evidence is current to: 22 August 2021. Study characteristics We only included and analysed one study (with 22 adults with sickle cell disease) in the review. The participants had high levels of protein (proteinuria) or albumin (microalbuminuria) in their urine and were randomly selected to be treated for six months with either captopril (an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor) or placebo (dummy drug with no active medication). Key results The results from this small and very low‐quality study were not convincing. We downgraded our judgements on the certainty of the evidence because of at least an unclear or a high risk of bias in almost all areas we assessed, as well as imprecision (results showed a wide range of possible effects) and indirectness (the study did not include any children and only a small number of adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria). This study did not show that ACE inhibitors could reduce the level of protein or albumin in the urine. The levels of creatinine (a chemical compound left over from energy‐producing processes in muscles; a high level can indicate kidney failure) and potassium in the blood were reported as constant throughout the study. No serious adverse events were noted, although the potential for causing low blood pressure should be highlighted. More long‐term studies involving multiple centers and larger numbers of participants are needed. Certainty of the evidence Overall certainty of the evidence was very low, since  we thought there was either a high or unclear risk of bias from all aspects that may contribute to biasing the results (e.g. randomisation, the way treatment allocations were concealed, whether all participants recruited were analysed, whether all planned outcomes were reported, as well as blinding of participants, research personnel and outcome assessment). We also noted that the study did not include children, which limits the evidence for this treatment in children. Our statistical calculations on the effect found a high degree of imprecision. There may be selective reporting on sodium levels, but other electrolyte levels were reported. Nevertheless, the amount of data with detailed descriptions has allowed only limited analysis in this review.","12","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Albuminuria [drug therapy, etiology]; *Anemia, Sickle Cell [complications, drug therapy]; *Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors [therapeutic use]; *Proteinuria [drug therapy, etiology]; Angiotensins; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD009191.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009191.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) is an important morbidity in cystic fibrosis. It is the result of the accumulation of viscid faecal material within the bowel which combines with thick, sticky mucus produced in the intestines of people with cystic fibrosis. The intestine may be completely blocked (complete DIOS) or only partially blocked (incomplete DIOS). Once a diagnosis of DIOS has been made, the goal of therapy is to relieve the acute complete or incomplete faecal obstruction and ultimately prevent the need for surgical intervention . Objectives This review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different treatment regimens for the treatment of DIOS (complete and incomplete) in children and adults with cystic fibrosis.

Date of search: 09 September 2021. We also searched online trial registries. Date of last search: 12 October 2021. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials, quasi‐randomised controlled trials (including cross‐over trials (to be judged on an individual basis)) comparing the use of laxative agents or surgery for treating DIOS in children, young people and adults with cystic fibrosis to each other, placebo or no intervention. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened papers, extracted trial details and assessed for risk of bias. The authors assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE. Main results There was one trial with 20 participants (16 females) included in the review. The mean age of participants was 13.1 years. The trial was a double‐blinded, randomised cross‐over trial which had a duration of 12 months in total and compared high‐dose and low‐dose pancreatic enzyme therapy. As only the abstract of the trial was available, the overall risk of bias was judged to be unclear. The trial did not address either of our primary outcomes (time until resolution of DIOS and treatment failure rate), but reported episodes of acute DIOS, presence of abdominal mass and abdominal pain. There were no numerical data available for these outcomes, but the authors stated that there was no difference between treatment with high‐dose or low‐dose pancreatic enzymes. The overall certainty of the evidence was found to be very low. Authors' conclusions There is a clear lack of evidence for the treatment of DIOS in people with cystic fibrosis. The included abstract did not address our primary outcome measures and did not provide numerical data for the two secondary outcomes it did address. Therefore, we cannot justify the use of high‐dose pancreatic enzymes for treating DIOS, nor can we comment on the efficacy and safety of other laxative agents. From our findings, it is clear that more randomised controlled trials need to be conducted in this area. Plain language summary Interventions for treating distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) in cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of different treatments for distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) in children and adults with cystic fibrosis. Background Cystic fibrosis is a common, life‐limiting, inherited disease. One of the main features of cystic fibrosis is the thick, sticky mucus produced by many organs including the lungs, pancreas and intestine. DIOS occurs when mucus in the intestine combines with faeces and builds up to produce a mass. This mass can partially or completely block the intestine and cause symptoms such as vomiting, severe abdominal pain and a swollen stomach (abdominal distension). Once a diagnosis of DIOS has been made, the goal of therapy is to relieve the complete or partial blockage and ultimately prevent the need for any surgical intervention. Search date The evidence is current to: 12 October 2021. Trial characteristics The review included one trial with 20 people with cystic fibrosis who were aged between 7.1 and 23.2 years of age (average 13.1 years old). The 12‐month trial compared a high dose of pancreatic enzymes with a low dose of pancreatic enzymes for treating chronic DIOS. Key results The trial did not report on our primary outcomes (time until DIOS successfully treated and treatment failure rate), but addressed two of our secondary outcomes; episodes of acute DIOS and the harmful effects that might occur in participants (the presence of an abdominal mass and abdominal pain). There were no numerical data available for these results, but the authors reported that there was no difference between high‐dose or low‐dose pancreatic enzymes. Certainty of the evidence We found the overall certainty of the evidence to be very low. The trial itself was only published as an abstract from a conference which did not include numerical data and it was not published as a full report. This meant that we do not know many details about the trial. We thought that the overall risk of bias was unclear, as the trial authors did not describe how participants were put into the treatment groups, whether any participants dropped out or whether the planned outcomes were the same as the reported outcomes. The trial also had a very small number of participants and a limited age range, making it difficult to draw conclusions about the relevance of the treatment for all people with cystic fibrosis.","12","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Cystic Fibrosis [complications]; *Intestinal Obstruction [etiology, therapy]; Abdominal Pain [drug therapy, etiology]; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Female; Humans; Pancreas; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD012798.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012798.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD012619.PUB3","Carroll, W; Green, J; Gilchrist, FJ","Interventions for preventing distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) in cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2021","Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common, life‐limiting, genetically inherited disease. It affects multiple organs, particularly the respiratory system. However, gastrointestinal problems such as constipation and distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) are also important and well‐recognised complications in CF. They share similar symptoms e.g. bloating, abdominal pain, but are distinct conditions. Constipation occurs when there is gradual faecal impaction of the colon, but DIOS occurs when there is an accumulation of faeces and sticky mucus, forming a mass in the distal part of the small intestine. The mass may partially block the intestine (incomplete DIOS) or completely block the intestine (complete DIOS). Symptoms of DIOS can affect quality of life and other aspects of CF health, such as airway clearance, exercise, sleep and nutritional status. Treatment of constipation and prevention of complete bowel obstruction are required for gastrointestinal management in CF. However, many different strategies are used in clinical practice and there is a lack of consensus. The importance of this topic was highlighted in a recent research priority setting exercise by the James Lind Alliance. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of laxative agents of differing types for preventing DIOS (complete and incomplete) in children and adults with CF. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of search: 09 September 2021. We also searched online trial registries. Date of last search: 12 October 2021. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled parallel trials comparing laxative therapy for preventing DIOS (including osmotic agents, stimulants, mucolytics and substances with more than one action) at any dose to placebo, no treatment or an alternative laxative therapy, in people of any age with pancreatic sufficient or insufficient CF and any stage of lung disease. Randomised cross‐over trials were judged on an individual basis. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted outcome data and performed a risk of bias assessment for the included data. We judged the certainty of the evidence using GRADE criteria. Main results We included one cross‐over trial (17 participants) with a duration of 12 months, in which participants were randomly allocated to either cisapride (a gastro‐prokinetic agent) or placebo for six months each. The trial had an unclear risk of bias for most domains but had a high risk of reporting bias. Radiograph scores revealed no difference in occurrence of DIOS between cisapride and placebo (narrative report, no data provided). There were no adverse effects. Symptom scores were the only secondary outcome within the review that were reported. Total gastrointestinal symptom scores favoured cisapride with a statistically significant mean difference (MD) of ‐7.60 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐14.73 to ‐0.47). There was no significant difference at six months between cisapride and placebo for abdominal distension, MD ‐0.90 (95% CI ‐2.39 to 0.59) or abdominal pain, MD ‐0.4 (95% CI ‐2.05 to 1.25). The global symptom scores (whether individuals felt better or worse) were reported in the paper to favour cisapride and be statistically significant (P < 0.05). We assessed the available data to be very low certainty. There was a great deal of missing data from the included trial and the investigators failed to report numerical data for many outcomes. The overall risk of bias of the trial was unclear and it had a high risk for reporting bias. There was also indirectness; the trial drug (cisapride) has since been removed from the market in several countries due to adverse effects, thus it has no current applicability for preventing DIOS. The included trial also had very few participants, which downgraded the certainty a further level for precision. Authors' conclusions There is an absence of evidence for interventions for the prevention of DIOS. As there was only one included trial, we could not perform a meta‐analysis of the data. Furthermore, the included trial compared a prokinetic agent (cisapride) that is no longer licensed for use in a number of countries due to the risk of serious cardiac events, a finding that came to light after the trial was conducted. Therefore, the limited findings from the trial are not applicable in current clinical practice. Overall, a great deal more research needs to be undertaken on gastrointestinal complications in CF, as this is a very poorly studied area compared to respiratory complications in CF. Plain language summary Which interventions are effective and safe for preventing distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) in cystic fibrosis? Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited, life‐long condition that causes organ systems in the body to produce large amounts of thick and sticky mucus. The most commonly affected area is the lungs, in which thick mucus leads to recurrent chest infections and breathing difficulties. Another commonly affected area is the digestive system. Many people with CF suffer from bloating and abdominal pain which may be caused by constipation or distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS). In DIOS, overproduction of thick mucus combines with stool and sticks to the intestinal wall. This mass can partially block the intestine (incomplete DIOS) or completely block the intestine (complete DIOS). The latter causes severe pain, vomiting and is treated as a medical emergency. As part of effective care for people with CF, constipation should therefore be treated and complete bowel obstruction be prevented. It is also important to recognise that constipation and DIOS impact on other aspects of CF health. Bloating, abdominal pain and nausea may affect airway clearance, exercise and sleep. Nutritional status may also be affected due to decreased appetite and malabsorption. DIOS may affect the absorption of other medications taken by people with CF. Overall, DIOS can significantly impair quality of life. Different laxatives are currently used in clinics, but prescribing practices differ and there is no consensus on optimal treatment strategies. Hence, this review aimed to analyse the evidence for the preventing DIOS. Search date We last searched for evidence: 12 October 2021. Trial characteristics We included one trial in the review, which included 17 people aged between 13 to 35 years. These people were randomly put into groups to take either a placebo drug (with no active medication) or cisapride for six months each and then to cross over and take the alternative treatment for a further six months. Key results The trial used radiography to diagnose DIOS, but did not provide any data and only stated that there was no difference between cisapride and placebo. The trial also stated that there were no adverse effects from the cisapride. The trial assessed participant‐reported total and individual gastrointestinal symptom scores. People in the cisapride group reported an improvement in total gastrointestinal symptom scores compared to those in the placebo group. However, there were no differences reported between groups for the individual symptom scores of abdominal pain and abdominal distension (swelling). Participants also reported global symptom scores, which showed that most people felt better taking cisapride compared to placebo. Certainty of the evidence The overall certainty of the evidence was very low. With one trial in this review, we could not combine data from different trials. The trial did not provide enough information about the methods used for allocating participants or about missing data and did not fully report certain results. The small number of participants also lowered the precision of the results. Since this trial was conducted, cisapride has been removed from the market in a number of countries due to rare but serious heart complications, therefore it has no applicability to current clinical practice.","12","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Cystic Fibrosis [complications]; *Intestinal Obstruction [etiology, prevention & control]; Cisapride; Constipation [etiology, prevention & control]; Humans; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD012619.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012619.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

CF mainly affects the respiratory system, but cystic fibrosis‐related diabetes (CFRD) is a common extrapulmonary co‐morbidity and causes excess morbidity and mortality in this population. Continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS) are a relatively new technology and, as yet, the impact of these on the monitoring and subsequent management of CFRD remains undetermined. Objectives To establish the impact of insulin therapy guided by continuous glucose monitoring compared to insulin therapy guided by other forms of glucose data collection on the lives of people with CFRD. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of latest search: 23 September 2021. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews and online trials registries. Date of last search: 23 September 2021. Selection criteria Randomised controlled studies comparing insulin regimens led by data from CGMS (including real‐time or retrospective data, or both) with insulin regimens guided by abnormal blood glucose measurements collected through other means of glycaemic data collection in people with CFRD. Studies with a cross‐over design, even with a washout period between intervention arms, are not eligible for inclusion due to the potential long‐term impact of each of the interventions and the potential to compromise the outcomes of the second intervention. Data collection and analysis No studies were included in the review, meaning that no data were available to be collected for analysis. Main results Review authors screened 14 studies at the full‐text stage against the review's inclusion criteria. Consequently, seven were excluded due to the study type being ineligible (not randomised), two studies were excluded due to their cross‐over design, and two studies was excluded since the intervention used was not eligible and one was a literature review. One study in participants hospitalised for a pulmonary exacerbation is ongoing. Investigators are comparing insulin dosing via insulin pump with blood sugar monitoring by a CGMS to conventional diabetes management with daily insulin injections (or on an insulin pump if already on an insulin pump in the outpatient setting) and capillary blood glucose monitoring. The participants in the control arm will wear a blinded continuous glucose monitoring system for outcome assessment. In addition to this, one further study is still awaiting classification, and will be screened to determine whether it is eligible for inclusion, or is to be excluded, in an update of this review. Authors' conclusions No studies were included in the review, indicating that there is currently insufficient evidence to determine the impact of insulin therapy guided by CGMS compared to insulin therapy guided by other forms of glucose data collection on the lives of people with CFRD, nor on potential adverse effects of continuous glucose monitoring in this context. Randomised controlled studies are needed to generate evidence on the efficacy and safety of continuous glucose monitoring in people with CFRD. There is one relevant ongoing study that may be eligible for inclusion in a future update of this Cochrane Review, and whose results may help answer the review question. Plain language summary Continuous glucose monitoring systems for monitoring cystic fibrosis‐related diabetes Review question Canusing continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS) help people with cystic fibrosis‐related diabetes (CFRD) manage their condition better? Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life‐shortening genetic condition. Many people with CF also develop CFRD, where their blood glucose, or the amount of sugar in their blood, can rise to harmful levels. People with CFRD seem to experience more frequent chest infections and a shorter life expectancy than people with CF who do not have diabetes. CFRD can be managed with injections of insulin to help keep blood sugar in the normal range. To do this safely, people with CFRD need to routinely check blood sugar levels to make sure that they are taking the right amount of insulin. They usually do this by pricking their fingers and measuring a drop of blood on a machine. CGMS are devices that can be worn by a person and which closely estimate blood sugar levels without the need for regular pin‐prick testing. They are a relatively new technology and we still do not know how they affect the monitoring and management of CFRD. We wanted to find out whether using CGMS was better or worse than other methods, such as using the traditional 'finger stick' method, for monitoring blood sugar levels inpeople with CFRD. The main outcomes we wanted to look at were quality of life, any problems the CGMS might cause, and the amount of time a person's blood sugar stayed in the normal range. We decided that theseoutcomes were most important afterasking people with CFRD and their families what mattered most to them. Search date Evidence is current to: 23 September 2021. Study characteristics We did not find any relevant studies to include in the review, but we found two studies which we might be able to include in an update of this review when we have more information about them and they have both been completed. Key results When we ran our searches, we did not find any studies that matched our inclusion criteria. This means we cannot comment on how CGMS affects the outcomes we set out to investigate as there is no evidence for us to look at. We found one ongoing study in people with CFRD who are in hospital for a pulmonary exacerbation (flare up of chest symptoms). The study is comparing the effects of giving insulin via an insulin pump and monitoring blood sugar using a CGMS to giving daily insulin injections (or if participants are already using an insulin pump before being admitted to hospital, they continue with this) and monitoring blood sugar levels using the 'finger stick' method. The people using the finger stick method will wear a dummy CGMS so the clinicians measuring outcomes will not know which group they are in. The study has not yet been completed, so we could not include it, but we might be able to include it in a future version of this review.  More research is needed on this topic to help fill the gap in the evidence which we have identified in this review.","11","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Cystic Fibrosis [complications]; *Diabetes Mellitus; Blood Glucose; Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring; Humans; Retrospective Studies","10.1002/14651858.CD013755.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013755.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD008190.PUB3","McTavish, D; Thornton, J","Appetite stimulants for people with cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2022","Abstract - Background Chronic loss of appetite in cystic fibrosis concerns both individuals and families. Appetite stimulants have been used to help cystic fibrosis patients with chronic anorexia attain optimal body mass index (BMI) and nutritional status. However, these may have adverse effects on clinical status. This is an updated version of the original review. Objectives To systematically search for and evaluate the evidence on the beneficial effects of appetite stimulants in the management of cystic fibrosis‐related anorexia and synthesise reports of any side effects. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register and online trials registries; handsearched reference lists; and contacted local and international experts to identify relevant trials. Last search of the Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 23 May 2022. Last search of online trial registries: 10 May 2022. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials of appetite stimulants compared to placebo, control, no treatment or different appetite stimulants, or to the same appetite stimulants at different doses or regimens for at least one month in adults and children with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the included trials. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence and performed meta‐analyses. Main results We included four trials (70 participants) comparing appetite stimulants (cyproheptadine hydrochloride and megestrol acetate) to placebo; the numbers of adults or children within each trial were not always reported. We assessed the certainty of evidence as low due to the small number of participants, incomplete or selective outcome reporting, and unclear risk of selection bias.  Regarding our primary outcomes, a meta‐analysis of two trials (42 participants) showed that appetite stimulants may produce a larger increase in weight (kg) at three months (mean difference (MD) 1.25 kg, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 0.45 to 2.05), and one trial (17 participants) showed a similar result at six months (MD 3.80 kg, 95% CI 1.27 to 6.33) (both low‐certainty evidence). Results also showed that weight z score may increase with appetite stimulants compared to placebo at three months (MD 0.61, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.93; 3 studies; 40 participants; P < 0.001) and at six months (MD 0.74, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.22; 1 trial; 17 participants). There was no evidence of a difference in effect between cyproheptadine hydrochloride and megestrol acetate for either outcome.   Only one trial (25 participants) reported analysable data for body composition (BMI), with results favouring cyproheptadine hydrochloride compared to placebo; a further trial (16 participants) narratively agreed with this result. All four trials reported on lung function at durations ranging from two to nine months. Considering analysable data, two trials (42 participants) found that appetite stimulants may make little or no difference in forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV 1 ) % predicted at three months, and one trial (17 participants) found similar results at six months. Two further three‐month trials narratively agreed with these results. Limited information was reported for secondary outcomes. Two trials (23 participants) reported results showing that appetite stimulants may increase appetite compared to placebo at three months (odds ratio 45.25, 95% CI 3.57 to 573.33; low‐certainty evidence).  Only one study reported on quality of life, finding that cyproheptadine reduced fatigue in two participants compared with none with placebo. One study (25 participants) found no difference in energy intake between appetite stimulant or placebo at three months. Insufficient reporting of adverse effects prevented a full determination of their impact. Two studies (33 participants) narratively reported similar requirements for additional antibiotics between appetite stimulants and placebo at three months.  Authors' conclusions At six months in adults and children, appetite stimulants improved only two of the outcomes of this review: weight (or weight z score) and subjectively reported appetite. Insufficient reporting of side effects prevented a full determination of their impact. Whilst the data may suggest the potential use of appetite stimulants in treating anorexia in adults and children with cystic fibrosis, this is based upon low‐certainty evidence from a small number of trials, therefore firm conclusions cannot be drawn. Clinicians need to be aware of the potential adverse effects of appetite stimulants and actively monitor any individuals prescribed these medications accordingly. Research is required to determine meaningful surrogate measures for appetite and to define what constitutes quality weight gain. Future trials of appetite stimulants should use a validated measure of symptoms including a disease‐specific instrument for measuring poor appetite. This review highlights the need for multicentred, adequately powered, and well‐designed trials to evaluate agents to safely increase appetite in people with cystic fibrosis and to establish the optimal mode of treatment. Plain language summary Appetite stimulants for people with cystic fibrosis Review question We looked for evidence on both beneficial and adverse effects of using appetite stimulants in people with anorexia linked to cystic fibrosis. Background Loss of appetite in people with cystic fibrosis concerns both those with the disease and their families. Appetite stimulants have been used to help people with cystic fibrosis who have a poor appetite to increase the amounts they eat so they gain weight and improve their overall health. However, there are concerns that appetite stimulants can cause side effects. This is an updated version of the original review. Search date We last looked for evidence on 23 May 2022. Study characteristics We included four trials (70 participants), two of which were performed in children and two in both children and adults. The trials looked at the effects of drugs (megestrol acetate and cyproheptadine hydrochloride) compared to a placebo (a tablet that contained no medicine) to stimulate appetite. The trials lasted between three and six months. Key results We found that these drugs may improve weight and appetite in the short term (up to six months). No effect was seen on lung function. All stimulants can have adverse effects which can worsen cystic fibrosis, such as effects on blood sugar control, fatigue, mood, fluid retention, the liver, and shortness of breath, but unfortunately insufficient reporting of side effects prevented a full understanding of their effects. The included trials were too small to show if megestrol acetate and cyproheptadine hydrochloride can improve weight and appetite safely. Whilst there is evidence to suggest that appetite stimulants may improve weight and poor appetite in adults and children with cystic fibrosis, we believe more research is needed to identify appropriate ways of measuring appetite, and then to collect sound data from enough patients to find out if appetite stimulants can improve appetite safely in cystic fibrosis. Certainty of the evidence We have low confidence in the results being able to show the true effectiveness of appetite stimulants. We came to this conclusion because although we think that most of the people taking part had the same chance of being in the appetite stimulant or placebo group, and no one could not tell the difference between the appetite stimulant or the placebo, there may be some bias due to the small numbers of participants in the studies, and because in two studies some participants withdrew without clear reasons being given. Another possible source of bias is that three studies did not report on all of their pre‐planned outcomes.

Staging classifications, such as the Arnold‐Hilgartner classification for haemophilic arthropathy of the knee, radiologically reflect the extent of knee joint destruction with underlying chronic synovitis. Management of this highly morbid disease process involves intensive prophylactic measures, and chemical or radioisotope synovectomy in its early stages. However, failure of non‐surgical therapy in people with progression of chronic arthropathy often prompts surgical management, including synovectomy, joint debridement, arthrodesis, and arthroplasty, depending on the type of joint and extent of the damage. To date, management of people with mild to moderate chronic arthropathy from haemophilia remains controversial; there is no agreed standard treatment. Thus, the benefits and disadvantages of non‐surgical and surgical management of mild to moderate chronic arthropathy in people with haemophilia needs to be systematically reviewed.  Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of surgery for mild to moderate chronic arthropathy in people with haemophilia A or B. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and two trial registers to August 2022. We also handsearched relevant journals and conference abstract books. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing surgery and non‐surgical interventions, for any joint with chronic arthropathy, in people with haemophilia, who were at least 12 years old. Data collection and analysis The review authors did not identify any trials to include in this review. Main results The review authors did not identify any trials to include in this review. Authors' conclusions The review authors did not identify any trials to include in this review. Due to a lack of research in this particular area, we plan to update the literature search every two years, and will update review if any new evidence is reported. There is a need for a well‐designed RCT that assesses the safety and efficacy of surgical versus non‐surgical interventions for chronic arthropathy in people with haemophilia. Plain language summary Surgery for long‐term joint disease in people with haemophilia How does surgery compare to non‐surgical treatment in terms of safety and efficacy for people with chronic (long‐term) joint disease from a rare condition that affects the ability of the blood to form clots (haemophilia)? Key messages We did not find any relevant studies. More research is needed in this field. Future studies should compare surgical and non‐surgical treatments for chronic arthropathy in people with haemophilia. Background Haemophilia is a disease that affects the ability of blood to clot. People with severe haemophilia often suffer from bleeding into their joints (haemarthrosis). Repeated bleeding over a long period will eventually lead to chronic joint disease (arthropathy), which may take the form of arthritis, joint pain or joint stiffness. This can lead to worsening quality of life and loss of limb function. Chronic joint disease from prolonged joint bleeding can be treated non‐surgically or surgically. But neither of these treatment options are perfect; both have their own risks and benefits. Non‐surgical treatments may not work for everyone. if they do not work, surgery may be recommended. Physicians are still uncertain about the safest and most effective way to treat chronic arthropathy in people with haemophilia. What did we do? We searched medical databases and journal up to August 2022, for reports of randomised controlled studies (RCT) that compared surgical and non‐surgical treatments, in people who were at least 12 years old, suffered from haemophilia and were developing chronic joint disease. RCTs are those in which participants are assigned randomly to two or more treatment groups. This is the best way to ensure that groups of participants are similar, and that investigators and participants do not know who is in which group. What did we find? We did not find any studies that met our criteria.","11","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Hemophilia A [complications]; *Joint Diseases [etiology, surgery]; Child; Humans; Knee Joint; MEDLINE; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD013634.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013634.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD001021.PUB4","Smith, S; Rowbotham, NJ","Inhaled anti‐pseudomonal antibiotics for long‐term therapy in cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2022","Abstract - Background Inhaled antibiotics are commonly used to treat persistent airway infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  that contributes to lung damage in people with cystic fibrosis. Current guidelines recommend inhaled tobramycin for individuals with cystic fibrosis and persistent  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  infection who are aged six years or older. The aim is to reduce bacterial load in the lungs so as to reduce inflammation and deterioration of lung function. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To evaluate the effects of long‐term inhaled antibiotic therapy in people with cystic fibrosis on clinical outcomes (lung function, frequency of exacerbations and nutrition), quality of life and adverse events (including drug‐sensitivity reactions and survival). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched ongoing trials registries. Date of last search: 28 June 2022. Selection criteria We selected trials where people with cystic fibrosis received inhaled anti‐pseudomonal antibiotic treatment for at least three months, treatment allocation was randomised or quasi‐randomised, and there was a control group (either placebo, no placebo or another inhaled antibiotic). Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected trials, judged the risk of bias, extracted data from these trials and judged the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE system. Main results The searches identified 410 citations to 125 trials; 18 trials (3042 participants aged between five and 45 years) met the inclusion criteria. Limited data were available for meta‐analyses due to the variability of trial design and reporting of results. A total of 11 trials (1130 participants) compared an inhaled antibiotic to placebo or usual treatment for a duration between three and 33 months. Five trials (1255 participants) compared different antibiotics, two trials (585 participants) compared different regimens of tobramycin and one trial (90 participants) compared intermittent tobramycin with continuous tobramycin alternating with aztreonam. One trial (18 participants) compared an antibiotic to placebo and also to a different antibiotic and so fell into both groups. The most commonly studied antibiotic was tobramycin which was studied in 12 trials. Inhaled antibiotics compared to placebo We found that inhaled antibiotics may improve lung function measured in a variety of ways (4 trials, 814 participants). Compared to placebo, inhaled antibiotics may also reduce the frequency of exacerbations (risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47 to 0.93; 3 trials, 946 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Inhaled antibiotics may lead to fewer days off school or work (quality of life measure) (mean difference (MD) ‐5.30 days, 95% CI ‐8.59 to ‐2.01; 1 trial, 245 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There were insufficient data for us to be able to report an effect on nutritional outcomes and there was no effect on survival. There was no effect on antibiotic resistance seen in the two trials that were included in meta‐analyses. We are uncertain of the effect of the intervention on adverse events (very low‐certainty evidence), but tinnitus and voice alteration were the only events occurring more often in the inhaled antibiotics group. The overall certainty of evidence was deemed to be low for most outcomes due to risk of bias within the trials and imprecision due to low event rates. Different antibiotics or regimens compared Of the eight trials comparing different inhaled antibiotics or different antibiotic regimens, there was only one trial for each unique comparison. We found no differences between groups for any outcomes except for the following. Aztreonam lysine for inhalation probably improved forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV 1 ) % predicted compared to tobramycin (MD ‐3.40%, 95% CI ‐6.63 to ‐0.17; 1 trial, 273 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). However, the method of defining the endpoint was different to the remaining trials and the participants were exposed to tobramycin for a long period making interpretation of the results problematic. We found no differences in any measure of lung function in the remaining comparisons. Trials measured pulmonary exacerbations in different ways and showed no differences between groups except for aztreonam lysine probably leading to fewer people needing treatment with additional antibiotics than with tobramycin (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.86; 1 trial, 273 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); and there were fewer hospitalisations due to respiratory exacerbations with levofloxacin compared to tobramycin (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.98; 1 trial, 282 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Important treatment‐related adverse events were not very common across comparisons, but were reported less often in the tobramycin group compared to both aztreonam lysine and colistimethate. We found the certainty of evidence for these comparisons to be directly related to the risk of bias within the individual trials and varied from low to high. Authors' conclusions Long‐term treatment with inhaled anti‐pseudomonal antibiotics probably improves lung function and reduces exacerbation rates, but pooled estimates of the level of benefit were very limited. The best evidence available is for inhaled tobramycin. More evidence from trials measuring similar outcomes in the same way is needed to determine a better measure of benefit. Longer‐term trials are needed to look at the effect of inhaled antibiotics on quality of life, survival and nutritional outcomes. Plain language summary Inhaling antibiotics to treat lung infection in people with cystic fibrosis Review question Are inhaled antibiotics helpful against persistent infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in people with cystic fibrosis (CF)? Key messages As people with CF get older, they are more likely to become infected on a long‐term basis with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  This is the most common cause of chronic lung infection in people with CF . We wanted to find out whether antibiotics targeting  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  would reduce the effects of infection when they are breathed into the lungs. We wanted to learn whether this treatment would improve lung function, quality of life and survival. We also looked for any harmful effects. What is CF? Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease which results in abnormal mucus in several parts of the body and mainly affects the lungs, which are susceptible to infection by certain bacteria. Infection causes inflammation which results in progressive damage to the lungs. What did we find? The review includes 18 trials with 3042 people with CF aged between five and 45 years of age .  The trials lasted from three to 33 months. In 11 trials investigators compared inhaled antibiotics with a placebo (an inhaled substance without the medication in it) and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly. Eight trials compared one inhaled antibiotic with either a different inhaled antibiotic or a different schedule of the same inhaled antibiotic. One of the trials compared an antibiotic both to placebo and to a different antibiotic and so fell into both groups. Main results Results from four trials showed that when compared to placebo, inhaled antibiotics may improve lung function and reduce the number of times the people with CF had a worsening of symptoms (exacerbation). Inhaled antibiotics may also mean fewer days off school or work (a measure of quality of life). They did not seem to have an effect on survival. We are not sure of the side effects of inhaled antibiotics, but tinnitus and changes in voice were reported more often in people inhaling antibiotics rather than the placebo. We did not find enough evidence to be able to comment on how inhaled antibiotics affect height and weight. Where the trials compared different inhaled antibiotics or schedules, there was only one trial in each of the eight different comparisons. The only differences we found in all these comparisons were for two outcomes. In one trial we found that aztreonam lysine probably improved lung function more than tobramycin, but no important differences were found in the other trials with regard to lung function. Aztreonam lysine also probably led to fewer people needing additional courses of antibiotics than tobramycin and there were fewer hospitalisations after levofloxacin compared to placebo. We noted that important side effects that were related to the treatment were not very common in the trials, but they were less common with tobramycin than with other antibiotics. What are the limitations of the evidence? The trials that we included in this review measured lung function in different ways and also how often people experienced a sudden worsening of symptoms. That made it difficult for us to combine the results of different trials to strengthen our evidence. We thought the overall certainty of evidence was low for most outcomes, mainly due to risks of bias within the trials and low event rates meaning results were not precise. How up to date is this evidence?

Affected individuals show cholesterol deficiency and accumulation of various precursor molecules, mainly 7‐dehydrocholesterol and 8‐dehydrocholesterol. There is currently no cure for SLOS, with cholesterol supplementation being primarily a biochemical therapy of limited evidence. However, several anecdotal reports and preclinical studies have highlighted statins as a potential therapy for SLOS. Objectives To evaluate the effects of statins, either alone or in combination with other non‐statin therapies (e.g. cholesterol, bile acid, or vitamin co‐supplementation), compared to cholesterol supplementation alone or in combination with other non‐statin therapies (e.g. bile acid or vitamin supplementation) on several important outcomes including overall survival, neurobehavioral features, and adverse effects in individuals with SLOS. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases and three trials registers on 15 February 2022, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs with parallel or cross‐over designs, and non‐randomized studies of interventions (NRSIs) including non‐randomized trials, cohort studies, and controlled before‐and‐after studies, were eligible for inclusion in this review if they met our prespecified inclusion criteria, i.e. involved human participants with biochemically or genetically diagnosed SLOS receiving statin therapy or cholesterol supplementation, or both. Data collection and analysis Two authors screened titles and abstracts and subsequently full‐texts for all potentially‐relevant references. Both authors independently extracted relevant data from included studies and assessed the risks of bias. We analyzed the data extracted from the included NRSIs and cohort studies separately from the data extracted from the single included RCT. We used a random‐effects model to account for the inherent heterogeneity and methodological variation between these different study designs. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. Main results We included six studies (61 participants with SLOS); one RCT (N = 18), three prospective NRSIs (N = 20), and two retrospective NRSIs (N = 22). Five studies included only children, and two limited their participant inclusion by disease severity. Overall, there were nearly twice as many males as females. All six studies compared add‐on statin therapy to cholesterol supplementation alone. However, the dosages, formulations, and durations of treatment were highly variable across studies. We judged the RCT as having a high risk of bias due to missing data and selective reporting. All included NRSIs had a serious or critical overall risk of bias assessed by the Risk Of Bias In Non‐randomized Studies of Interventions tool (ROBINS‐I). None of the included studies evaluated survival or reported quality of life (QoL). Only the included RCT formally assessed changes in the neurobehavioral manifestations of SLOS, and we are uncertain whether statin therapy improves this outcome (very low‐certainty evidence). We are also uncertain whether the adverse events reported in the RCT were statin‐related (very low‐certainty evidence). In contrast, the adverse events reported in the NRSIs seem to be possibly due to statin therapy (risk ratio 13.00, 95% confidence interval 1.85 to 91.49; P = 0.01; low‐certainty evidence), with only one of the NRSIs retrospectively mentioning changes in the irritability of two of their participants. We are uncertain whether statins affect growth based on the RCT or NRSI results (very low‐certainty evidence). The RCT showed that statins may make little or no difference to plasma biomarker levels (low‐certainty evidence), while we are uncertain of their effects on such parameters in the NRSIs (very low‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions Currently, there is no evidence on the potential effects of statin therapy in people with SLOS regarding survival or QoL, and very limited evidence on the effects on neurobehavioral manifestations. Likewise, current evidence is insufficient and of very low certainty regarding the effects of statins on growth parameters in children with SLOS and plasma or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of various disease biomarkers. Despite these limitations, current evidence seemingly suggests that statins may increase the risk of adverse reactions in individuals with SLOS receiving statins compared to those who are not. Given the insufficient evidence on potential benefits of statins in individuals with SLOS, and their potential for causing adverse reactions, anyone considering this therapy should take these findings into consideration. Future studies should address the highlighted gaps in evidence on the use of statins in individuals with SLOS by collecting prospective data on survival and performing serial standardized assessments of neurobehavioral features, QoL, anthropometric measures, and plasma and CSF biomarker levels after statin introduction. Future studies should also attempt to use consistent dosages, formulations and durations of cholesterol and statin therapy. Plain language summary Statins for Smith‐Lemli‐Opitz syndrome Review question Is statin therapy, either alone or combined with cholesterol therapy, linked to better outcomes (e.g. survival, quality of life, severity or frequency of neurobehavioral abnormalities, changes in growth parameters or biomarker levels) compared to cholesterol therapy alone for people with Smith‐Lemli‐Opitz syndrome (SLOS), and what are the risks of harmful effects for either option? Background Smith‐Lemli‐Opitz syndrome is a genetic malformation syndrome, which occurs when cholesterol is not able to be produced by the body and there is a build up of several toxic molecules that would, under normal circumstances, go on to become cholesterol, such as 7DHC and 8DHC. This means that people with SLOS may fail to achieve normal physical growth, show various degrees of intellectual disability or developmental delay (or both), and show a range of possible behavioral abnormalities (e.g. irritability, aggressiveness, anxiety, attention‐deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), impulsivity and sleep disturbances, among others). It is also notable that SLOS may cause various possible physical abnormalities and disability. There is currently no cure for SLOS, but cholesterol supplementation remains common practice among clinicians caring for people with SLOS. This is based solely on our current understanding of the underlying biochemistry of the disease itself. However, there has been evidence from studies in the laboratory and in single individuals suggesting that statins may be helpful for treating people with SLOS. Search date We conducted our latest search on 15 February 2022. Study characteristics In this review, we included six studies of different designs that included a total of 61 people with SLOS, mostly males. Five of the studies only included children (18 years old or younger). All studies compared a combination of statin and cholesterol therapy to cholesterol supplementation alone. However, the studies used different doses and formulations of statin or cholesterol therapy (or both), as well as different durations of treatment. Key results We found no evidence for the effects of combined statin and cholesterol supplementation, compared to cholesterol supplementation alone, on survival or quality of life in people with SLOS. We are also not sure if combined statin and cholesterol therapy has positive effects on neurobehavioral manifestations or growth in individuals with SLOS compared with cholesterol therapy alone, as we have low confidence in the evidence. We think people with SLOS receiving statin therapy in addition to cholesterol supplementation are more likely to experience adverse events that are usually associated with using statins, compared to those who are only receiving cholesterol supplementation. Finally, we are uncertain about the effects of statin therapy on the levels of various biomarkers usually measured in the blood of people with SLOS.","11","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors [adverse effects]; *Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome [drug therapy]; Bile Acids and Salts; Child; Cholesterol; Cross-Over Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Vitamins","10.1002/14651858.CD013521.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013521.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Pulmonary exacerbations are when symptoms of infection become more severe. Antibiotics are an essential part of treatment for exacerbations and inhaled antibiotics may be used alone or in conjunction with oral antibiotics for milder exacerbations or with intravenous antibiotics for more severe infections. Inhaled antibiotics do not cause the same adverse effects as intravenous antibiotics and may prove an alternative in people with poor access to their veins. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To determine if treatment of pulmonary exacerbations with inhaled antibiotics in people with cystic fibrosis improves their quality of life, reduces time off school or work, and improves their long‐term lung function. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register. Date of the last search: 7 March 2022. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry and WHO ICTRP for relevant trials. Date of last search: 3 May 2022. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials in people with cystic fibrosis with a pulmonary exacerbation in whom treatment with inhaled antibiotics was compared to placebo, standard treatment or another inhaled antibiotic for between one and four weeks. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected eligible trials, assessed the risk of bias in each trial and extracted data. They assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE criteria. Authors of the included trials were contacted for more information. Main results Five trials with 183 participants are included in the review. Two trials (77 participants) compared inhaled antibiotics alone to intravenous antibiotics alone and three trials (106 participants) compared a combination of inhaled and intravenous antibiotics to intravenous antibiotics alone. Trials were heterogenous in design and two were only available in abstract form. Risk of bias was difficult to assess in most trials but, for four out of five trials, we judged there to be a high risk from lack of blinding and an unclear risk with regards to randomisation. Results were not fully reported and only limited data were available for analysis. One trial was a cross‐over design and we only included data from the first intervention arm. Inhaled antibiotics alone versus intravenous antibiotics alone Only one trial (18 participants) reported a perceived improvement in lifestyle (quality of life) in both groups (very low‐certainty evidence). Neither trial reported on time off work or school. Both trials measured lung function, but there was no difference reported between treatment groups (very low‐certainty evidence). With regards to our secondary outcomes, one trial (18 participants) reported no difference in the need for additional antibiotics and the second trial (59 participants) reported on the time to next exacerbation. In neither case was a difference between treatments identified (both very low‐certainty evidence). The single trial (18 participants) measuring adverse events and sputum microbiology did not observe any in either treatment group for either outcome (very low‐certainty  evidence). Inhaled antibiotics plus intravenous antibiotics versus intravenous antibiotics alone Inhaled antibiotics plus intravenous antibiotics may make little or no difference to quality of life compared to intravenous antibiotics alone. None of the trials reported time off work or school. All three trials measured lung function, but found no difference between groups in forced expiratory volume in one second (two trials; 44 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) or vital capacity (one trial; 62 participants). None of the trials reported on the need for additional antibiotics. Inhaled plus intravenous antibiotics may make little difference to the time to next exacerbation; however, one trial (28 participants) reported on hospital admissions and found no difference between groups. There is likely no difference between groups in adverse events (very low‐certainty evidence) and one trial (62 participants) reported no difference in the emergence of antibiotic‐resistant organisms (very low‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions We identified only low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence to judge the effectiveness of inhaled antibiotics for the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis. The included trials were not sufficiently powered to achieve their goals. Hence, we are unable to demonstrate whether one treatment was superior to the other or not. Further research is needed to establish whether inhaled tobramycin may be used as an alternative to intravenous tobramycin for some pulmonary exacerbations. Plain language summary Inhaling antibiotics to treat temporary worsening of lung infection in people with cystic fibrosis Review question What evidence is there for using inhaled antibiotics to treat exacerbations (flare ups) of lung infection in people with cystic fibrosis? Background Cystic fibrosis is a serious genetic disorder that results in abnormally sticky mucus in several parts of the body. In the lungs this sticky mucus can lead to repeated infections. An exacerbation makes the symptoms of infection more severe. Antibiotics are an essential part of treatment and may be given by mouth (orally), by needle into the blood stream (intravenously) or by inhaling the drug. We wanted to learn if inhaling antibiotics improved general health compared to the other methods. This might mean that people with cystic fibrosis could avoid hospitalisation for intravenous antibiotics and some side effects of intravenous treatment. Inhaling the antibiotics would also be easier for people who have difficulty with access to their veins. This is an updated version of the review. Search date We last looked for evidence on 7 March 2022. Study characteristics We found five trials comparing different ways of giving antibiotics when treating exacerbations in a total of 183 people with cystic fibrosis. Two trials compared inhaled antibiotics alone to intravenous antibiotics alone (77 participants) and three trials compared a combination of inhaled and intravenous antibiotics to intravenous antibiotics alone (106 participants). In all trials, the inhaled antibiotics were compared to the same antibiotics given intravenously. The numbers of participants in each trial ranged from 16 to 62. Key results Inhaled antibiotics alone versus intravenous antibiotics alone One trial (18 participants) reported a perceived improvement in lifestyle in both groups, but neither trial reported on time off work or school. Both trials measured lung function, but neither reported any difference between treatment groups. One trial (18 participants) reported no difference in the need for additional antibiotics and the second trial (59 participants) reported on the length of time until the next exacerbation ‐ there was no difference between inhaled or intravenous antibiotics for either outcome. Only one trial (18 participants) measured adverse events and sputum microbiology, but did not find any difference between treatments for either outcome. Inhaled antibiotics plus intravenous antibiotics versus intravenous antibiotics alone One trial found that there is likely no difference in quality of life between treatments. All of the trials reported lung function, but found no difference between groups. One trial showed there to be little or no difference in the time until the next exacerbation. None of the trials reported on the need for additional antibiotics; however, one trial (28 participants) found no difference in the number of hospital admissions between groups. There may be no difference between groups in adverse events and one trial (62 participants) reported no difference in the appearance of antibiotic‐resistant organisms. Certainty of the evidence We graded the certainty of the evidence as very low or low. We had concerns since only one trial stated how the participants were diagnosed with CF or how they defined an exacerbation. It was not possible to keep secret which treatment the participants were receiving, as the trials compared different ways of giving the antibiotics; we thought this would likely influence some of the results. We were not sure whether the participants were put into the different groups truly at random and we do not know how this might have affected the results.","8","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Anti-Bacterial Agents [administration & dosage, therapeutic use]; *Cystic Fibrosis [complications, drug therapy]; Administration, Inhalation; Humans; Lung; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Tobramycin [administration & dosage, therapeutic use]","10.1002/14651858.CD008319.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008319.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the effects of physical activity interventions on exercise capacity by peak oxygen uptake, lung function by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ), health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) and further important patient‐relevant outcomes in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. The most recent search was on 3 March 2022. We also searched two ongoing trials registers: clinicaltrials.gov, most recently on 4 March 2022; and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), most recently on 16 March 2022.  Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing physical activity interventions of any type and a minimum intervention duration of two weeks with conventional care (no physical activity intervention) in people with CF. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected RCTs for inclusion, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.  Main results We included 24 parallel RCTs (875 participants). The number of participants in the studies ranged from nine to 117, with a wide range of disease severity. The studies' age demographics varied: in two studies, all participants were adults; in 13 studies, participants were 18 years and younger; in one study, participants were 15 years and older; in one study, participants were 12 years and older; and seven studies included all age ranges. The active training programme lasted up to and including six months in 14 studies, and longer than six months in the remaining 10 studies. Of the 24 included studies, seven implemented a follow‐up period (when supervision was withdrawn, but participants were still allowed to exercise) ranging from one to 12 months. Studies employed differing levels of supervision: in 12 studies, training was supervised; in 11 studies, it was partially supervised; and in one study, training was unsupervised. The quality of the included studies varied widely. This Cochrane Review shows that, in studies with an active training programme lasting over six months in people with CF, physical activity probably has a positive effect on exercise capacity when compared to no physical activity (usual care) (mean difference (MD) 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 3.05; 6 RCTs, 348 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The magnitude of improvement in exercise capacity is interpreted as small, although study results were heterogeneous. Physical activity interventions may have no effect on lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) % predicted) (MD 2.41, 95% CI ‒0.49 to 5.31; 6 RCTs, 367 participants), HRQoL physical functioning (MD 2.19, 95% CI ‒3.42 to 7.80; 4 RCTs, 247 participants) and HRQoL respiratory domain (MD ‒0.05, 95% CI ‒3.61 to 3.51; 4 RCTs, 251 participants) at six months and longer (low‐certainty evidence). One study (117 participants) reported no differences between the physical activity and control groups in the number of participants experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation by six months (incidence rate ratio 1.28, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.94) or in the time to first exacerbation over 12 months (hazard ratio 1.34, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.80) (both high‐certainty evidence); and no effects of physical activity on diabetic control (after 1 hour: MD ‒0.04 mmol/L, 95% CI ‒1.11 to 1.03; 67 participants; after 2 hours: MD ‒0.44 mmol/L, 95% CI ‒1.43 to 0.55; 81 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). We found no difference between groups in the number of adverse events over six months (odds ratio 6.22, 95% CI 0.72 to 53.40; 2 RCTs, 156 participants; low‐certainty evidence). For other time points (up to and including six months and during a follow‐up period with no active intervention), the effects of physical activity versus control were similar to those reported for the outcomes above. However, only three out of seven studies adding a follow‐up period with no active intervention (ranging between one and 12 months) reported on the primary outcomes of changes in exercise capacity and lung function, and one on HRQoL. These data must be interpreted with caution. Altogether, given the heterogeneity of effects across studies, the wide variation in study quality and lack of information on clinically meaningful changes for several outcome measures, we consider the overall certainty of evidence on the effects of physical activity interventions on exercise capacity, lung function and HRQoL to be low to moderate. Authors' conclusions Physical activity interventions for six months and longer likely improve exercise capacity when compared to no training (moderate‐certainty evidence). Current evidence shows little or no effect on lung function and HRQoL (low‐certainty evidence). Over recent decades, physical activity has gained increasing interest and is already part of multidisciplinary care offered to most people with CF. Adverse effects of physical activity appear rare and there is no reason to actively discourage regular physical activity and exercise. The benefits of including physical activity in an individual's regular care may be influenced by the type and duration of the activity programme as well as individual preferences for and barriers to physical activity. Further high‐quality and sufficiently‐sized studies are needed to comprehensively assess the benefits of physical activity and exercise in people with CF, particularly in the new era of CF medicine. Plain language summary Physical activity to improve exercise capacity in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about whether physical activity interventions (including exercise) have any effect on exercise capacity, health‐related quality of life and lung function in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). This is an update of a previously published review. Background CF affects many systems in the body, but mainly the lungs. It causes shortness of breath and limits the amount of exercise people with CF can tolerate. The progress of lung disease leads to a low ability to exercise and to physical inactivity, which in turn affects health and health‐related quality of life. We looked for studies where people with CF engaged in a physical activity intervention (including endurance‐type activities such as walking, jogging, swimming and cycling; or resistance training; or combinations of both) compared to a control group with no intervention (usual care). Search date The evidence is current to 3 March 2022. Study characteristics We included 24 studies (875 participants) in this review. The number of people in each study ranged from nine to 117. Some studies included only children, others only adults, and some both children and adults. The studies included people with a wide range of disease severity. The studies used differing levels of supervision in their active training programmes: in 12 studies, participants were supervised; in 11 studies, participants were partially supervised; and in one study, participants were not supervised at all. The active training programme lasted up to and including six months in 14 studies, and longer than six months in the remaining 10 studies. Of the 24 included studies, seven added on a follow‐up period (when all participants reverted to usual care, but were still allowed to exercise if they wished). The quality of the included studies varied widely. Key results This systematic review shows that physical activity interventions for longer than six months probably improve exercise capacity in people with CF. When compared with no activity, physical activity interventions may make little or no difference to lung function and health‐related quality of life. The largest study included in this review (117 participants) reported: ‐ no differences between the physical activity and control groups in the number of pulmonary exacerbations (a flare up of disease) (high‐certainty evidence); ‐ no differences in the time to the first flare up for 12 months (high‐certainty evidence); ‐ no beneficial effects of physical activity on diabetic control after nine months (moderate‐certainty evidence). Two studies (156 participants) found no differences between groups in the number of reported adverse events (low‐certainty evidence). For active training programmes lasting up to and including six months, the effects were similar to the longer programmes.  Only three studies which added a follow‐up period (of varying durations) reported data we could analyse on changes in exercise capacity and lung function; and only one reported on quality of life. These results must be interpreted with caution.  Overall and when compared to usual care (no intervention), physical activity and exercise training probably lead to slightly better exercise capacity, while they may have little or no effect on lung function and health‐related quality of life in people with CF. Certainty of the evidence We included 24 studies. Given the differences in effects across studies, the wide variation in study quality and the lack of information on clinically meaningful changes for several outcome measures, we consider the overall certainty of the evidence on the effects of physical activity interventions on exercise capacity, lung function and health‐related quality of life as low to moderate. We are uncertain about the effects we have seen and better‐quality studies will likely change these findings. Factors affecting our certainty included that, in five studies, the characteristics of some of the people taking part were different between groups at the start of the studies, despite people being put into the different treatment groups at random. Also, when comparing physical activity interventions to no intervention, people will always know which group they are in. However, we do not think the fact that people knew which treatment they were receiving would affect the results for lung function, as long as the assessments were done properly. In contrast, some bias may be introduced when investigators assessing a person's exercise capacity know to which group the person belongs. Investigators tried to prevent the outcome assessors from knowing to which groups the participants belonged in 10 included studies. Selective reporting of results may also be an issue, especially as most of the included studies were not listed in trial registries, where details of the outcomes are reported.","8","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Cystic Fibrosis [drug therapy]; Adolescent; Adult; Exercise; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Quality of Life","10.1002/14651858.CD002768.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002768.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD010429.PUB3","Bhardwaj, A; Swe, KM; Sinha, NK","Treatment for osteoporosis in people with beta‐thalassaemia","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2023","Abstract - Background Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass and micro‐architectural deterioration of bone tissue leading to increased bone fragility. In people with beta‐thalassaemia, osteoporosis represents an important cause of morbidity and is due to a number of factors. First, ineffective erythropoiesis causes bone marrow expansion, leading to reduced trabecular bone tissue with cortical thinning. Second, excessive iron loading causes endocrine dysfunction, leading to increased bone turnover. Lastly, disease complications can result in physical inactivity, with a subsequent reduction in optimal bone mineralization. Treatments for osteoporosis in people with beta‐thalassaemia include bisphosphonates (e.g. clodronate, pamidronate, alendronate; with or without hormone replacement therapy (HRT)), calcitonin, calcium, zinc supplementation, hydroxyurea, and HRT alone (for preventing hypogonadism). Denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, inhibits bone resorption and increases bone mineral density (BMD). Finally, strontium ranelate simultaneously promotes bone formation and inhibits bone resorption, thus contributing to a net gain in BMD, increased bone strength, and reduced fracture risk. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives To review the evidence on the efficacy and safety of treatment for osteoporosis in people with beta‐thalassaemia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group’s Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which includes references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched online trial registries. Date of most recent search: 4 August 2022. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in people with beta‐thalassaemia with: a BMD Z score below −2 standard deviations (SDs) for children aged under 15 years, adult males (aged 15 to 50 years) and premenopausal females aged over 15 years; or a BMD T score below  − 2.5 SDs for postmenopausal females and males aged over 50 years. Data collection and analysis Two review authors assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of the included RCTs, and extracted and analysed data. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Main results We included six RCTs (298 participants). Active interventions included bisphosphonates (3 trials, 169 participants), zinc supplementation (1 trial, 42 participants), denosumab (1 trial, 63 participants), and strontium ranelate (1 trial, 24 participants). The certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low and was downgraded mainly due to concerns surrounding imprecision (low participant numbers), but also risk of bias issues related to randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding. Bisphosphonates versus placebo or no treatment Two RCTs compared bisphosphonates to placebo or no treatment. After two years, one trial (25 participants) found that alendronate and clodronate may increase BMD Z score compared to placebo at the femoral neck (mean difference (MD) 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.58) and the lumbar spine (MD 0.14, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.23). One trial (118 participants) reported that neridronate compared to no treatment may increase BMD at the lumbar spine and total hip at six and 12 months; for the femoral neck, the study found increased BMD in the neridronate group at 12 months only. All results were of very low‐certainty. There were no major adverse effects of treatment. Participants in the neridronate group reported less back pain; we considered this representative of improved quality of life (QoL), though the certainty of the evidence was very low. One participant in the neridronate trial (116 participants) sustained multiple fractures as a result of a traffic accident. No trials reported BMD at the wrist or mobility. Different doses of bisphosphonate compared One 12‐month trial (26 participants) assessed different doses of pamidronate (60 mg versus 30 mg) and found a difference in BMD Z score favouring the 60 mg dose at the lumbar spine (MD 0.43, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.76) and forearm (MD 0.87, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.51), but no difference at the femoral neck (very low‐certainty evidence). This trial did not report fracture incidence, mobility, QoL, or adverse effects of treatment. Zinc versus placebo  One trial (42 participants) showed zinc supplementation probably increased BMD Z score compared to placebo at the lumbar spine after 12 months (MD 0.15, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.20; 37 participants) and 18 months (MD 0.34, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.40; 32 participants); the same was true for BMD at the hip after 12 months (MD 0.15, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.19; 37 participants) and 18 months (MD 0.26, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.31; 32 participants). The evidence for these results was of moderate certainty. The trial did not report BMD at the wrist, fracture incidence, mobility, QoL, or adverse effects of treatment. Denosumab versus placebo  Based on one trial (63 participants), we are unsure about the effect of denosumab on BMD Z score at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and wrist joint after 12 months compared to placebo (low‐certainty evidence). This trial did not report fracture incidence, mobility, QoL, or adverse effects of treatment, but the investigators reported a reduction in bone pain measured on a visual analogue scale in the denosumab group after 12 months of treatment compared to placebo (MD  − 2.40 cm, 95% CI  − 3.80 to  − 1.00). Strontium ranelate  One trial (24 participants) only narratively reported an increase in BMD Z score at the lumbar spine in the intervention group and no corresponding change in the control group (very low‐certainty evidence). This trial also found a reduction in back pain measured on a visual analogue scale after 24 months in the strontium ranelate group compared to the placebo group (MD  − 0.70 cm (95% CI  − 1.30 to  − 0.10); we considered this measure representative of improved quality of life. Authors' conclusions Bisphosphonates may increase BMD at the femoral neck, lumbar spine, and forearm compared to placebo after two years' therapy. Zinc supplementation probably increases BMD at the lumbar spine and hip after 12 months .  Denosumab may make little or no difference to BMD, and we are uncertain about the effect of strontium on BMD. We recommend further long‐term RCTs on different bisphosphonates and zinc supplementation therapies in people with beta‐thalassaemia‐associated osteoporosis. Plain language summary Treatment of osteoporosis in people with beta‐thalassaemia Review question How effective and safe are different treatments for osteoporosis in people with beta‐thalassaemia? Background Osteoporosis affects bone density over time and leads to an increased risk of fractures. It is an important cause of illness in people with beta‐thalassaemia (a blood disorder that reduces the production of haemoglobin). There are several possible treatments for osteoporosis in people with beta‐thalassaemia, including bisphosphonates (medicines that help to slow bone loss), calcitonin, calcium, zinc supplementation, hydroxyurea, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), denosumab (which inhibits bone resorption and increases bone mineral density (BMD)), and strontium ranelate (which promotes bone formation and inhibits bone resorption). We wanted to find the most effective way of treating osteoporosis in people with beta‐thalassaemia. Our key outcomes were BMD at the lower back, hip, and wrist (higher is better); fractures; mobility; quality of life; and unwanted effects of treatment. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Search date The evidence is current to 4 August 2022. Trial characteristics The review included six trials in which 298 people with beta‐thalassaemia aged between 10 and 78 years of age were randomly allocated to a treatment group .  Trials investigated bisphosphonates (alendronate, clodronate, neridronate, and pamidronate), zinc sulphate supplementation, denosumab, and strontium ranelate. Five studies compared active treatment to dummy treatment (placebo) or no treatment, while one trial compared two different doses of bisphosphonates. Four trials were scheduled to last two years (though at the time of writing, one of these trials only had 12‐month data published), and two trials lasted 12 months. Key results Bisphosphonates versus placebo or no treatment One trial, which enrolled 25 people, found that alendronate and clodronate may increase BMD at the lower back and hip compared with placebo after two years. One trial, which enrolled 118 people, reported increased BMD at the lower back and femoral neck (the part of the thigh bone that connects to the pelvis) at six and 12 months with neridronate compared with no treatment, but only at 12 months for the whole hip joint (there were no data to analyse).  One person in the neridronate trial (118 participants) reported fractures following a road traffic accident. We are uncertain of the effects of neridronate on quality of life. We are also uncertain whether bisphosphates have unwanted effects. No trials reported BMD at the wrist or mobility. Pamidronate 60 mg versus pamidronate 30 mg One 12‐month trial, which enrolled 26 people, compared different monthly doses of pamidronate (30 mg versus 60 mg). We are uncertain of the effect of the different doses on BMD at the lower back, hip, and forearm. This trial did not report fractures, mobility, quality of life, or unwanted effects of treatment. Zinc versus placebo One trial, which enrolled 42 people, showed that zinc supplementation compared to placebo probably increases BMD at the lower back and hip after 12 months and after 18 months. This trial did not report BMD at the wrist, fractures, mobility, quality of life or unwanted effects of treatment. Denosumab versus placebo One trial, which enrolled 63 people, compared denosumab 60 mg to placebo. We are unsure about the effect of denosumab on BMD at the lower back, hip, and wrist after 12 months compared to placebo. The trial did not report fractures, mobility, quality of life, or unwanted effects of treatment, but it did report a reduction in bone pain with denosumab after 12 months. Strontium ranelate versus placebo  One trial, which enrolled 24 people, narratively reported an increase in BMD at the lower back after 24 months in people taking strontium ranelate, but no change in those taking the placebo. The trial also reported a decrease in back pain with strontium ranelate, which we considered representative of improved quality of life, through the results were very uncertain. Limitations of the evidence We are moderately confident in some results, but have little or very little confidence in others. There were not many participants in any individual trial and we had some concerns about the trial methods. Specifically, although all the trials stated that people received different treatments at random, two trials did not describe exactly how they decided who was given which treatment. In addition, only two trials described how they stopped people knowing which group they were in.","5","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Fractures, Bone; *Osteoporosis [drug therapy, etiology]; *beta-Thalassemia [complications, drug therapy]; Adult; Alendronate; Child; Clodronic Acid; Denosumab [therapeutic use]; Diphosphonates [therapeutic use]; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pamidronate","10.1002/14651858.CD010429.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010429.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD007862.PUB5","Wilson, LM; Saldanha, IJ; Robinson, KA","Active cycle of breathing technique for cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2023","Abstract - Background People with cystic fibrosis (CF) experience chronic airway infections as a result of mucus buildup within the lungs. Repeated infections often cause lung damage and disease. Airway clearance therapies aim to improve mucus clearance, increase sputum production, and improve airway function. The active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) is an airway clearance method that uses a cycle of techniques to loosen airway secretions including breathing control, thoracic expansion exercises, and the forced expiration technique. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To compare the clinical effectiveness of ACBT with other airway clearance therapies in CF. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched clinical trials registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 29 March 2021. Selection criteria We included randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled clinical studies, including cross‐over studies, comparing ACBT with other airway clearance therapies in CF. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened each article, abstracted data and assessed the risk of bias of each study. We used GRADE to assess our confidence in the evidence assessing quality of life, participant preference, adverse events, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) % predicted, forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted, sputum weight, and number of pulmonary exacerbations. Main results Our search identified 99 studies, of which 22 (559 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Eight randomised controlled studies (259 participants) were included in the analysis; five were of cross‐over design. The 14 remaining studies were cross‐over studies with inadequate reports for complete assessment. The study size ranged from seven to 65 participants. The age of the participants ranged from six to 63 years (mean age 18.7 years). In 13 studies follow up lasted a single day. However, there were two long‐term randomised controlled studies with follow up of one to three years. Most of the studies did not report on key quality items, and therefore, have an unclear risk of bias in terms of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and outcome assessor blinding. Due to the nature of the intervention, none of the studies blinded participants or the personnel applying the interventions. However, most of the studies reported on all planned outcomes, had adequate follow up, assessed compliance, and used an intention‐to‐treat analysis. Included studies compared ACBT with autogenic drainage, airway oscillating devices (AOD), high‐frequency chest compression devices, conventional chest physiotherapy (CCPT), positive expiratory pressure (PEP), and exercise. We found no difference in quality of life between ACBT and PEP mask therapy, AOD, other breathing techniques, or exercise (very low‐certainty evidence). There was no difference in individual preference between ACBT and other breathing techniques (very low‐certainty evidence). One study comparing ACBT with ACBT plus postural exercise reported no deaths and no adverse events (very low‐certainty evidence). We found no differences in lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) % predicted and forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted), oxygen saturation or expectorated sputum between ACBT and any other technique (very low‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in the number of pulmonary exacerbations between people using ACBT and people using CCPT (low‐certainty evidence) or ACBT with exercise (very low‐certainty evidence), the only comparisons to report this outcome. Authors' conclusions There is little evidence to support or reject the use of the ACBT over any other airway clearance therapy and ACBT is comparable with other therapies in outcomes such as participant preference, quality of life, exercise tolerance, lung function, sputum weight, oxygen saturation, and number of pulmonary exacerbations. Longer‐term studies are needed to more adequately assess the effects of ACBT on outcomes important for people with cystic fibrosis such as quality of life and preference. Plain language summary A comparison of active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) with other methods of airway clearance therapies in people with cystic fibrosis Review question What are the effects of active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) compared with other methods of airway clearance in people with cystic fibrosis? Background Chronic infections are common in cystic fibrosis, and repeated infections can cause lung damage and disease. People with cystic fibrosis use airway clearance therapies to clear mucus and improve lung function. The ACBT uses a combination of three breathing methods to loosen and clear mucus. This is an update of a previously published review. Search date The evidence is current to: 29 March 2021. Study characteristics While we included 22 studies comparing ACBT with other airway clearance therapies in the review, only eight studies (259 participants) reported data that we could include in the analysis. Each of the eight studies compared different techniques: ACBT was compared with autogenic drainage, airway oscillating devices, high‐frequency chest compression devices, positive expiratory pressure, conventional chest physiotherapy, and ACBT together with exercise. Most studies lasted a single day, but there were two studies that lasted between one and three years. Participants ranged in age from six to 63 years and most (59%) were male. Key results We found that ACBT was comparable with other treatments in outcomes such as quality of life, personal preference, exercise tolerance, lung function, sputum weight, oxygen saturation, and the number of pulmonary exacerbations. We were not able to show that any single technique was better than another. Longer studies are needed to better assess the effects of ACBT on outcomes important for people with cystic fibrosis such as quality of life and personal preference. Certainty of the evidence We have little or no confidence in the evidence and think that further research is very likely to affect our conclusions of this review for any of the interventions analysed. Many of the studies did not provide enough details of their methods to determine if there were any biases that might have affected the results. Many studies did not report how they decided who would get which treatment and how they made sure that the people who were putting people into the different treatment groups and those who were assessing the results did not know which group each individual was in. Most of the included studies had a cross‐over design (where people have one treatment and then switch to the second), and many of these did not report the length of time in between different treatments. As it is possible that the first treatment might affect the results of the next treatment, we only included results from the first treatment period. Many of the studies did not report separate results for just the first treatment period, so we did not include their results in our review. All participants knew which treatment group they were in (it is not possible to disguise different physiotherapy techniques). This could have affected the results for some of the self‐reported outcomes, such as quality of life, personal preference, or exercise tolerance, but is unlikely to have affected the more objective outcomes, such as lung function. Most of the studies followed those taking part for less than one month and did this for most of the participants for the entire study period. In two out of the three longer studies more than 10% of the people taking part dropped out. The study results could be affected if the people who dropped out of the studies were not evenly spread across the different treatment groups. Over half of the studies checked that participants were using the airway clearance therapy they were supposed to. Most of the studies reported on all their planned outcomes. The findings of the review were limited as not many studies made the same comparisons; also, there were not many long‐term studies and the studies we included did not report enough data.","2","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Chest Wall Oscillation; *Cystic Fibrosis [therapy]; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Humans; Middle Aged; Mucus; Quality of Life; Respiratory Therapy [methods]; Young Adult","10.1002/14651858.CD007862.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007862.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD012969.PUB3","Mulimani, P; Abas, ABL; Karanth, L; Colombatti, R; Kulkarni, P","Treatment of dental and orthodontic complications in thalassaemia","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2023","Abstract - Background Thalassaemia is a quantitative abnormality of haemoglobin caused by mutations in genes controlling production of alpha or beta globins. Abnormally unpaired globin chains cause membrane damage and cell death within organ systems and destruction of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow, leading to haemolytic anaemia. The life‐long management of the general health effects of thalassaemia is highly challenging, and failure to deal with dental and orthodontic complications exacerbates the public health, financial and personal burden of the condition. There is a lack of evidence‐based guidelines to help care seekers and providers manage such dental and orthodontic complications. This review aimed to evaluate the available evidence on methods for treating dental and orthodontic complications in people with thalassaemia to inform future recommendations. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2019. Objectives To assess different methods for treating dental and orthodontic complications in people with thalassaemia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register in September 2022, and we searched nine online databases and trials registries in January 2022. We searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews and contacted haematologists, experts in fields of dentistry, organisations, pharmaceutical companies and researchers working in this field. Selection criteria We searched for published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated treatment of dental and orthodontic complications in individuals diagnosed with thalassaemia, irrespective of phenotype, severity, age, sex and ethnic origin. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the 37,242 titles retrieved by the search. After deduplication, we identified two potentially relevant RCTs. On assessing their eligibility against our inclusion and exclusion criteria, we excluded one and included the other. Main results We included one parallel‐design RCT conducted in Saudi Arabia and involving 29 participants (19 males, 10 females) with thalassaemia. It aimed to assess the effectiveness of photodynamic therapy as an adjuvant to conventional full‐mouth ultrasonic scaling for the treatment of gingivitis. The average age of participants was around 23 years. There is very low‐certainty evidence from this trial that full‐mouth ultrasonic scaling plus photodynamic therapy compared to full‐mouth ultrasonic scaling alone may improve gingival index score and bleeding on probing after 12 weeks in people with thalassaemia. We found no studies that assessed other interventions for the various dental or orthodontic complications of thalassaemia. Authors' conclusions Although the included study showed greater reduction in gingivitis in the group treated with full‐mouth ultrasonic scaling plus photodynamic therapy, the evidence is of very low certainty. The study had unclear risk of bias, a short follow‐up period and no data on safety or adverse effects. We cannot make definitive recommendations for clinical practice based on the limited evidence of a single trial. Future studies will very likely affect the conclusions of this review. This review highlights the need for high‐quality RCTs that investigate the effectiveness of various treatment modalities for dental and orthodontic complications in people with thalassaemia. It is crucial that future trials assess adverse effects of interventions. Plain language summary Treatment of dental and orthodontic problems in thalassaemia What is thalassaemia? Red blood cells make a pigment known as haemoglobin which carries oxygen around the body. In people with thalassaemia, the haemoglobin is not normal, due to defects (mutations) in two specific types of genes. This leads to the condition being classified as either alpha or beta thalassaemia. About 5% of the world population carry the mutation that causes the alpha globin gene to function only partially or not at all; the carrier rate for the beta globin gene is about 1.5%. Both forms of thalassaemia are mainly found in the belt of countries stretching from Sub‐Saharan Africa, through the Mediterranean region and the Middle East, to South and South‐East Asia. These disorders are increasingly found in many other parts of the world due to people moving from country to country. How does thalassaemia cause dental and orthodontic problems? When people inherit two copies of the mutated gene, the defective haemoglobin in the red blood cells does not release oxygen normally into the body. Defective cells build up in the body's organs and bone marrow cells, causing tissue damage and cell death, which leads to a decrease in red blood cells (anaemia). The lack of oxygen due to anaemia can stop organs from working normally, and people often need blood transfusions to correct the decrease in red blood cells. The body tries to compensate for the anaemia naturally by making more red blood cells, which causes expansion of the bone marrow spaces. In the skull, cheekbones and jawbones, this expanding bone marrow causes abnormal bony swellings, which can result in jaw deformity and teeth not being in their correct position (known as malocclusion). Severe changes to the face and jaw lead to difficulties with speech, eating and appearance. These visible features can be distressing for people with thalassaemia and have a negative impact on their quality of life. To survive, people with thalassaemia have to focus on dealing with the serious impact of anaemia on their general health and on managing complications related to the long‐term treatment of the condition. Consequently, they may neglect dental problems like tooth decay, gum disease and infections, and ordinary dental problems can become more severe and require advanced treatment. Before dental practitioners start any kind of dental treatment in people with thalassaemia, they need to consider both the underlying condition and the effects of the resulting anaemia or its treatment. Dental treatment may be particularly risky in people with thalassaemia who have had their spleen removed, as this can make them more prone to infections. There are no guidelines describing the best treatment plan, due to a lack of information in the scientific literature.  What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if any intervention was better than another to:  1. improve how teeth are aligned; 2. reduce the severity of any other dental complications; 3. reduce unwanted effects of treatment; 4. reduce pain; 5. reduce infections after dental treatment using preventive antibiotics; 6. improve quality of life; or 7. reduce the effects on professional and academic functions (e.g. loss or change of job, number of days off work or school). What did we do? We searched for studies that evaluated any treatment for dental or orthodontic problems in people with thalassaemia. We summarised the results and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.  What did we find? We found only one study suitable for inclusion in our review. This trial was conducted in a clinical setting in Saudi Arabia and enroled 29 people with thalassaemia. One group of participants received treatment with a light stimulation device in the infected areas of the gums in addition to professional full‐mouth cleaning, and the other group received professional full‐mouth cleaning only. Main results Full‐mouth cleaning plus light stimulation may reduce some aspects of gum inflammation more than full‐mouth cleaning alone. The study did not report any of our other outcomes of interest listed above. What are the limitations of the evidence? The study did not examine the effects of treatment beyond 12 weeks; nor did it examine unwanted effects of treatment. For these reasons, we have little confidence in the evidence. We cannot make definitive clinical recommendations based on this one study. How up to date is the evidence? The evidence is current to January 2022.","2","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Gingivitis; *Thalassemia [complications, therapy]; Female; Humans; Male","10.1002/14651858.CD012969.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012969.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD013733.PUB2","Smith, S; Calthorpe, R; Herbert, S; Smyth, AR","Digital technology for monitoring adherence to inhaled therapies in people with cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2023","Abstract - Background Improved understanding and treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) has led to longer life expectancy, which is accompanied by an increasingly complex regimen of treatments. Suboptimal adherence to the treatment plan, in the context of respiratory disease, has been found to be associated with poorer health outcomes. With digital technology being more accessible, it can be used to monitor adherence to inhaled therapies via chipped nebulisers, mobile phone apps and web‐based platforms. This technology can allow monitoring of adherence as well as clinical outcomes, and allow feedback to both the person with CF and their healthcare team. Objectives To assess the effects of using digital technology to monitor adherence to inhaled therapies and health status in adults and children with CF. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books.  Date of last search: 28 October 2021. We also searched Embase and three clinical trial registries and checked references of included studies. Date of last search: 9 November 2021. Selection criteria We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) looking at the effects of a digital technology for monitoring adherence of children and adults with CF to inhaled therapies. Data collection and analysis Two review authors screened the search results for studies eligible for inclusion in the review and extracted their data. We used Risk of Bias 2 for assessing study quality. We assessed the overall certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Main results We included two studies in our review, with 628 participants aged five to 41 years. There was one study each for two different comparisons.  Nebuliser target inhalation mode versus standard inhalation mode The included parallel study was carried out over 10 weeks after a run‐in period of four to six weeks. The study compared the effects of a digitally enhanced inhalation mode (target inhalation mode) for nebulised antibiotics compared to standard mode in children attending a regional CF clinic in the United Kingdom. The study's primary outcome was the time taken to complete the inhaled treatment, but investigators also reported on adherence to therapy. The results showed that there may be an improvement in adherence with the target inhalation mode when this intervention is used (mean difference (MD) 24.0%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.95 to 45.05; low‐certainty evidence). The target inhalation mode may make little or no difference to forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) % predicted (MD 1.00 % predicted, 95% CI ‐9.37 to 11.37; low‐certainty evidence). The study did not report on treatment burden, quality of life (QoL) or pulmonary exacerbations. eNebuliser with digital support versus eNebuliser without support One large multicentre RCT monitored adherence via data‐tracking nebulisers. The intervention group also receiving access to an online web‐based platform, CFHealthHub, which offered tailored, flexible support from the study interventionist as well as access to their adherence data, educational and problem‐solving information throughout the 12‐month trial period. We graded all evidence as moderate certainty. Compared to usual care, the digital intervention probably improves adherence to inhaled therapy (MD 18%, 95% CI 12.90 to 23.10); probably leads to slightly reduced treatment burden (MD 5.1, 95% CI 1.79 to 8.41); and may lead to slightly improved FEV 1  % predicted (MD 3.70, 95% CI ‐0.23 to 7.63). There is probably little or no difference in the incidence of pulmonary exacerbations or QoL between the two groups. Authors' conclusions Digital monitoring plus tailored support via an online platform probably improves adherence to inhaled therapies and reduces treatment burden (but without a corresponding change in QoL) in the medium term (low‐ and moderate‐certainty evidence). In a shorter time frame, technological enhancement of inhaling antibiotics may improve adherence to treatment (low‐certainty evidence). There may be little or no effect on lung function with either intervention, and online monitoring probably makes no difference to pulmonary exacerbations.  Future research should assess the effect of digital technology on adherence in both children and adults. Consideration of adherence to the total treatment regimen is also important, as an improvement in adherence to inhaled therapies could come at the cost of adherence to other parts of the treatment regimen. Plain language summary Do digital technologies help people with cystic fibrosis stick to their inhaled treatments? Key messages In the short term, technology may help people with cystic fibrosis (CF) adhere (or 'stick to') their inhaled treatments, but have little or no effect on lung function or pulmonary exacerbations (flare‐ups of disease).  In the medium term, combining digital monitoring with tailored support via an online platform probably encourages people to adhere to inhaled treatment and reduces treatment burden (demands on people with CF made by their healthcare needs and the impact this has on their well‐being) but without improving quality of life.  Future research should look at using digital technology to help children and adults with CF adhere to their inhaled treatments and consider how this affects other areas of their treatment plan.  What is CF?  CF is a life‐threatening, inherited condition where sticky, thick mucus builds up in the lungs and digestive system. Over time, the lungs become damaged and may eventually stop working properly.  How is CF treated? There is currently no cure for CF, but treatment helps control symptoms and reduce complications. Treatments include antibiotics to prevent and treat chest infections, and medicines to thin the mucus in the lungs, making it easier to cough up. People with CF use inhalers and nebulisers to deliver medicines quickly to the lungs. Nebulisers are small machines that change liquid medicine into a mist which is then inhaled through a mouthpiece or mask.  Treating CF is complicated and time‐consuming; people with CF typically spend 2 to 2.5 hours daily on treatment.  Generally, digital technologies are increasingly used to help people monitor their health and fitness via activity trackers and mobile phone apps. For people with CF, digital technologies are used for tracking and improving how they manage their treatment. Some technologies allow information to be uploaded to the Internet, so individuals and their healthcare teams can immediately use this information to monitor and improve treatment. What did we want to find out?   Can digital technology help people with CF adhere to their inhaled treatments? Do digital technologies for monitoring adherence have any unwanted or harmful effects? What did we do? We searched for studies examining any kind of digital technology for monitoring adherence to inhaled treatments for CF. We summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found two studies using different digital technologies. We could not combine their results and analysed them separately. Both studies put the people taking part into one of two groups at random, with equal chances of being in either group.  One small study compared two breathing modes of a digital nebuliser in 20 children aged 5 to 16 years (the nebuliser delivered an antibiotic as an inhaled mist). One mode encouraged children to take longer, deeper breaths via an adapted mouthpiece; the other mode consisted of the usual breathing pattern. The study lasted for 10 weeks. The larger study involved 608 people aged 16 years and older. It compared a data‐tracking nebuliser paired with a web‐based platform called CFHealthHub to the same nebuliser used without the web‐based platform. CFHealthHub gave participants access to their adherence data and individual support from study investigators, who collected data for 12 months.  Key results The study comparing inhalation modes found that the children using the digitally enhanced breathing mode recorded higher adherence to nebuliser treatment than the children using the usual breathing mode. However, this may make little difference to lung function. There were no adverse (harmful or unwanted) effects from using the different inhalation modes.  The second study showed that combining an online programme with a data‐tracking nebuliser probably improves adherence compared to just using the nebuliser. The combination of nebuliser plus online support also probably lowers the 'burden of treatment'. However, it probably makes little or no difference to quality of life or the number of flare‐ups of disease. The group using the online platform reported slightly more adverse events, but we found no difference between groups in adverse effects we considered directly related to treatment (measured using anxiety and depression scores).  What are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in the evidence from the smaller study is limited because it was very small and focused on children, whereas our question was broader. It also only reported on two of our planned outcomes.  Our confidence in the evidence from the larger study ranged from low to moderate. This study was larger and looked at more of our outcomes. However, this study only included people aged 16 and older, so we do not know whether its findings apply to younger children.  Current evidence for how digital technology can improve adherence to inhaled treatments is limited. Future research should assess how technology can improve adherence to inhaled treatments in children and adults and consider how this affects the total treatment plan (adhering to inhaled treatments may decrease time spent on other treatments). How up to date is the evidence? The evidence is current to 28 October 2021.","2","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Cystic Fibrosis [complications]; Administration, Inhalation; Adult; Anti-Bacterial Agents [therapeutic use]; Child; Digital Technology; Humans; Nebulizers and Vaporizers; Quality of Life","10.1002/14651858.CD013733.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013733.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD001401.PUB4","Warnock, L; Gates, A","Airway clearance techniques compared to no airway clearance techniques for cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2023","Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited progressive life‐limiting disease characterised by the build‐up of abnormally thick, sticky mucus affecting mostly the lungs, pancreas, and digestive system. Airway clearance techniques (ACTs), traditionally referred to as chest physiotherapy, are recommended as part of a complex treatment programme for people with CF. The aim of an ACTs is to enhance mucociliary clearance and remove viscous secretions from the airways within the lung to prevent distal airway obstruction. This reduces the infective burden and associated inflammatory effects on the airway epithelia.  There are a number of recognised ACTs, none of which have shown superiority in improving short‐term outcomes related to mucus transport. This systematic review, which has been updated regularly since it was first published in 2000, considers the efficacy of ACTs compared to not performing any ACT in adults and children with CF. It is important to continue to review this evidence, particularly the long‐term outcomes, given the recent introduction of highly effective modulator therapies and the improved health outcomes and potential changes to CF management associated with these drugs. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and acceptability of airway clearance techniques compared to no airway clearance techniques or cough alone in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings, to 17 October 2022. We searched ongoing trials registers (Clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) to 7 November 2022. Selection criteria We included randomised or quasi‐randomised studies that compared airway clearance techniques (chest physiotherapy) with no airway clearance techniques or spontaneous cough alone in people with CF. Data collection and analysis Both review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We used GRADE methodology to assess the certainty of the evidence. Main results We included 11 cross‐over studies (153 participants) and one parallel study (41 participants). There were differences between studies in how the interventions were delivered, with several intervention groups combining more than one ACT. One study used autogenic drainage; five used conventional chest physiotherapy; nine used positive expiratory pressure (PEP), with one study varying the water pressure between arms; three studies used oscillating PEP; two used exercise; and two used high‐frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO). Of the 12 included studies, 10 were single‐treatment studies, and two delivered the intervention over two consecutive days (once daily in one study, twice daily in the second). This substantial heterogeneity in the treatment interventions precluded pooling of data for meta‐analysis. Blinding of participants, caregivers, and clinicians is impossible in airway clearance studies; we therefore judged all studies at unclear risk of performance bias. Lack of information in eight studies made assessment of risk of bias unclear for most other domains.  We rated the certainty of evidence as low or very low due to the short‐term cross‐over trial design, small numbers of participants, and uncertain risk of bias across most or all domains. Six studies (84 participants) reported no effect on pulmonary function variables following intervention; but one study (14 participants) reported an improvement in pulmonary function following the intervention in some of the treatment groups. Two studies reported lung clearance index: one (41 participants) found a variable response to treatment with HFCWO, whilst another (15 participants) found no effect on lung clearance index with PEP therapy (low‐certainty evidence). Five studies (55 participants) reported that ACTs, including coughing, increased radioactive tracer clearance compared to control, while a further study (eight participants) reported no improvement in radioactive tracer clearance when comparing PEP to control, although coughing was discouraged during the PEP intervention. We rated the certainty of evidence on the effect of ACTs on radioactive tracer clearance as very low. Four studies (46 participants) investigated the weight of mucus cleared from the lungs and reported greater secretions during chest physiotherapy compared to a control. One study (18 participants) reported no differences in sputum weight (very low‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions The evidence from this review shows that ACTs may have short‐term effects on increasing mucus transport in people with CF. All included studies had short‐term follow‐up; consequently, we were unable to draw any conclusions on the long‐term effects of ACTs compared to no ACTs in people with CF. The evidence in this review represents the use of airway clearance techniques in a CF population before widespread use of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and acceptability of airway clearance in those treated with highly effective CFTR modulators. Plain language summary Airway clearance techniques compared to no airway clearance techniques for cystic fibrosis Review question What are the effects of using any airway clearance technique compared to not using an airway clearance technique for clearing excess mucus from the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis? Background The lungs of people with cystic fibrosis produce excess mucus. This leads to repeated infection and tissue damage in the lungs. It is important to clear the mucus using medicines and airway clearance techniques (physiotherapy). There are different airway clearance techniques for clearing mucus, some of which may include the use of mechanical devices. Daily physiotherapy takes a lot of time and trouble, so it is important to know if it works. We searched for studies where the people taking part had equal chances of being in the group using airway clearance techniques or the group with no airway clearance techniques. This is an update of a previously published review. Search date The evidence is current to 17 October 2022. Study characteristics We included 12 studies that enrolled 194 people with cystic fibrosis. The studies were very different and some looked at multiple treatments compared to no treatment. One study used autogenic drainage (a controlled breathing technique which uses different speeds and depths of exhaled breath to move mucus up the airways so it can be cleared by coughing); five studies used conventional chest physiotherapy (manual techniques of percussion and vibration applied to the chest wall, usually with the assistance of a physiotherapist or relative); nine used positive expiratory pressure (breathing out through a mask or mouthpiece against a resistance which causes pressure to build up in the lungs to move the mucus), and one of these varied pressure so used both standard and high‐pressure positive expiratory pressure; three studies used oscillating positive expiratory pressure (positive expiratory pressure combined with vibrations within the airway to loosen mucus); two used exercise (on a treadmill); and two used high‐frequency chest wall oscillation (high frequency vibrations applied outside the chest wall via an inflatable garment). We could not combine any results to analyse them statistically. Key results Summarising the findings of the 12 studies, we found limited evidence of a short‐term impact on lung function. Only one study reported an improvement in lung function in some of the treatment groups, whilst six other studies found no improvement.  This review found that methods of clearing the airways may have short‐term benefits for moving mucus. Four studies found that the people using airway clearance techniques coughed up more sputum, but one study reported no difference with or without using an airway clearance technique. Five studies reported increased radioactive tracer clearance (a test in which people are imaged continuously after inhaling a radioaerosol to assess the time for it to be cleared from the lung) when using airway clearance, but one study of positive expiratory pressure found no difference. At present, there is no clear evidence to show the long‐term effects of performing airway clearance techniques on quality of life or survival. Limitations of the evidence We have little or very little confidence in the evidence, for several reasons. Most included studies had design problems, and in just under half of the studies, it was unclear whether all the results were reported. Also, in physiotherapy studies, the person receiving treatment and their physiotherapist know which treatment they are receiving, and this may affect some of the findings. For example, the amount of mucus coughed up and lung function tests (measured by half of the included studies) and a person's views on a particular technique (recorded in a quarter of the included studies) may be affected if a person is aware of which treatment they are receiving. Finally, it was not clear in most studies whether the individual was experienced with the technique they were using. We were unable to find any studies looking at the effects of airway clearance techniques in people treated with the new cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator treatments. Cystic fibrosis is caused by faulty proteins on the cell surface made by the mutated CFTR gene; these new medicines are designed to correct the function of the faulty proteins.

"CD011808.PUB3","Aboursheid, T; Albaroudi, O; Alahdab, F","Inhaled nitric oxide for treating pain crises in people with sickle cell disease","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2022","Abstract - Background In people with sickle cell disease, sickled red blood cells cause the occlusion of small blood vessels, which presents as episodes of severe pain known as pain crises or vaso‐occlusive crises. The pain can occur in the bones, chest, or other parts of the body, and may last several hours to days. Pain relief during crises includes both pharmacologic and non‐pharmacologic treatments. The efficacy of inhaled nitric oxide in pain crises has been a subject of controversy; hypotheses have been made suggesting a beneficial response due to its vasodilator properties, yet no conclusive evidence has been presented. This review aimed to evaluate the available randomised controlled studies addressing this topic. Objectives To capture the body of evidence evaluating the efficacy and safety of the use of inhaled nitric oxide in treating pain crises in people with sickle cell disease, and to assess the relevance, robustness, and validity of the treatment to better guide medical practice in the fields of haematology and palliative care (since the recent literature seems to favour the involvement of palliative care for such people). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register. We searched for unpublished work in the abstract books of the European Haematology Association conference, the American Society of Hematology conference, the British Society for Haematology Annual Scientific Meeting, the Caribbean Health Research Council Meetings, and the National Sickle Cell Disease Program Annual Meeting. The most recent search was conducted on 1 September 2021. We also searched ongoing study registries on 19 November 2021. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised trials comparing inhaled nitric oxide with placebo for treating pain crises in people with sickle cell disease. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data (including adverse event data), with any disagreements resolved by consulting a third review author. When the data were not reported in the text, we attempted to extract the data from available tables or figures. We contacted trial authors for additional information. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE criteria. Main results We included three trials involving a total of 188 participants in the review. There were equal numbers of males and females. Most participants were adults, although one small trial was conducted in a children's hospital and recruited children over the age of 10 years. All three parallel trials compared inhaled nitric oxygen (80 parts per million (ppm)) to placebo (nitrogen gas mixed with oxygen or room air) for four hours; one trial continued administering nitric oxide (40 ppm) for a further four hours. This extended trial had an overall low risk of bias; however, we had concerns about risk of bias for the remaining two trials due to their small sample size, and additionally a high risk of bias due to financial conflicts of interest in one of these smaller trials. We were only able to analyse some limited data from the eight‐hour trial, reporting the remaining results narratively. Evidence from one trial (150 participants) suggested that inhaled nitric oxide may not reduce the time to pain resolution: inhaled nitric oxide median 73.0 hours (95% confidence interval (CI) 46.0 to 91.0) and with placebo median 65.5 hours (95% CI 48.1 to 84.0) (low‐certainty evidence). No trial reported on the duration of the initial pain crisis. Only one large trial reported on the frequency of pain crises in the follow‐up period and found there may be little or no difference between the inhaled nitric oxide and placebo groups for return to the emergency department (risk ratio (RR) 0.73, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.71) and rehospitalisation (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.11) (150 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference between treatment and placebo in terms of reduction in pain score at any time point up to eight hours (150 participants). The two smaller trials reported a beneficial effect of inhaled nitric oxide in reducing the visual analogue pain score after four hours of the intervention. Analgesic use was reported not to differ greatly between the inhaled nitric oxide group and placebo group in any of the three trials, but no analysable data were provided. Two trials reported the median duration of hospitalisation: in the largest trial the placebo group had the shorter duration, whilst in the second smaller (paediatric) trial hospitalisation was shorter in the treatment group. Only the largest trial (150 participants) reported serious adverse events, with no increase in the inhaled nitric oxide group during or after the intervention compared to the control group (acute chest syndrome occurred in 5 out of 75 participants from each group, pyrexia in 1 out of 75 participants from each group, and dysphagia and a drop in haemoglobin were each reported in 1 out of 75 participants in the inhaled nitric oxide group) (low‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions The currently available evidence is insufficient to determine the effects (benefits or harms) of using inhaled nitric oxide to treat pain (vaso‐occlusive) crises in people with sickle cell disease. Large‐scale, long‐term trials are needed to provide more robust data in this area. Patient‐important outcomes (e.g. measures of pain and time to pain resolution and amounts of analgesics used), as well as use of healthcare services, should be measured and reported in a standardised manner. Plain language summary Inhaled nitric oxide for treating pain crises in people with sickle cell disease Review question Can inhaled nitric oxide relieve pain crises in people with sickle cell disease and does it have other beneficial effects (such as lessening the severity of pain, shortening hospital stays, or decreasing how often crises happen again) or any harmful effects? Background Sickle cell disease is a condition that affects the red blood cells. Normal red blood cells are round, but in people with sickle cell disease some of the red blood cells can have an abnormal shape like a crescent (or a sickle, a tool with a curved blade). The abnormally shaped cells easily become stuck in blood vessels, which can cause episodes of severe pain known as pain crises. The pain can be in the bones, chest, or other parts of the body, and can last from several hours to days. Painkillers are the main treatment of these pain crises. Another suggested treatment is inhaled nitric oxide, a gas that can relax the blocked blood vessels so they can widen and allow the sickled cells to pass. We wanted to find out whether inhaled nitric oxide is effective in relieving pain in people with sickle cell disease. Search date The evidence is current to 1 September 2021. Trial characteristics We included three trials with 188 people (equal numbers of males and females) with sickle cell disease who were experiencing a pain crisis. Most participants were adults, aside for one trial conducted in a children's hospital where most participants were children over 10 years of age. The trials compared inhaled nitric oxide with a placebo (dummy treatment, i.e. room air) which does not provide pain relief. Participants were assigned to one or the other treatment group at random. The treatments lasted for four hours in two trials and eight hours in the third trial. Key results Only one large trial (150 participants) reported time until the pain stopped, finding no difference between nitric oxide or room air. This trial was also the only trial to report on the frequency of pain crises in the follow‐up period, and we found little or no difference between inhaled nitric oxide and room air for a return to the emergency department or for readmission to hospital. All three trials reported pain scores: the larger trial found no difference between nitric oxide or room air at each time point up to eight hours, but the two smaller trials (38 participants) reported a benefit of inhaled nitric oxide in relieving the pain after four hours; however, these trials were small and limited compared to the first trial. All three trials reported that inhaled nitric oxide had no effect on decreasing the use of painkillers, but there were no data that could be analysed. Two trials reported the average duration of stay in hospital: in the large trial those who were given room air had a shorter stay, whilst the smaller trial conducted at the children's hospital reported a shorter stay in those treated with inhaled nitric oxide. Only the larger trial reported on harmful effects of nitric oxide, finding little or no difference between treatment groups. We could not combine the available data from the three included trials due to differences in the reporting of outcomes. As a result, the currently available evidence is not enough to give a clear answer about the use of inhaled nitric oxide for people with sickle cell disease experiencing a pain crisis. Future trials, preferably large‐scale and long term, should be carried out to provide strong evidence in this area. Investigators should measure and report outcomes important to patients (e.g. measures of pain and time to pain resolution and amounts of analgesics used), as well as use of healthcare services in a standardised way. Certainty of the evidence We judged the evidence that could be analysed to be of low certainty. We believe that the results in this review were affected because not all planned outcomes were reported in two trials, and the trials were small. Furthermore, the pharmaceutical industry financed the smaller adult trial, which should be considered when considering the results of this trial.","7","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Anemia, Sickle Cell; *Nitric Oxide [therapeutic use]; Adult; Analgesics [therapeutic use]; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Oxygen; Pain [drug therapy, etiology]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD011808.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011808.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Currently everolimus (a rapalog) is only approved for TSC‐associated renal angiomyolipoma and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA), but not other manifestations of TSC. A systematic review needs to establish evidence for rapamycin or rapalogs for various manifestations in TSC. This is an updated review. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of rapamycin or rapalogs in people with TSC for decreasing tumour size and other manifestations and to assess the safety of rapamycin or rapalogs in relation to their adverse effects. Search methods We identified relevant studies from the Cochrane‐Central‐Register‐of‐Controlled‐Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE and ongoing trials registries with no language restrictions. We searched conference proceedings and abstract books of conferences. Date of the last searches: 15 July 2022. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs of rapamycin or rapalogs in people with TSC. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of each study; a third review author verified the extracted data and risk of bias decisions. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Main results The current update added seven RCTs, bringing the total number to 10 RCTs (with 1008 participants aged 3 months to 65 years; 484 males). All TSC diagnoses were by consensus criteria as a minimum. In parallel studies, 645 participants received active interventions and 340 placebo. Evidence is low‐to‐high certainty and study quality is mixed; mostly a low risk of bias across domains, but one study had a high risk of performance bias (lack of blinding) and three studies had a high risk of attrition bias. Manufacturers of the investigational products supported eight studies. Systemic administration Six studies (703 participants) administered everolimus (rapalog) orally. More participants in the intervention arm reduced renal angiomyolipoma size by 50% (risk ratio (RR) 24.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.51 to 173.41; P = 0.001; 2 studies, 162 participants, high‐certainty evidence). In the intervention arm, more participants in the intervention arm reduced SEGA tumour size by 50% (RR 27.85, 95% CI 1.74 to 444.82; P = 0.02; 1 study; 117 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) ,and reported more skin responses (RR 5.78, 95% CI 2.30 to 14.52; P = 0.0002; 2 studies; 224 participants; high‐certainty evidence). In one 18‐week study (366 participants), the intervention led to 25% fewer seizures (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.09; P = 0.0001) or 50% fewer seizures (RR 2.28, 95% CI 1.44 to 3.60; P = 0.0004); but there was no difference in numbers being seizure‐free (RR 5.30, 95% CI 0.69 to 40.57; P = 0.11) (moderate‐certainty evidence). One study (42 participants) showed no difference in neurocognitive, neuropsychiatry, behavioural, sensory and motor development (low‐certainty evidence). Total adverse events (AEs) did not differ between groups (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.22; P = 0.16; 5 studies; 680 participants; high‐certainty evidence). However, the intervention group experienced more AEs resulting in withdrawal, interruption of treatment, or reduced dose (RR 2.61, 95% CI 1.58 to 4.33; P = 0.0002; 4 studies; 633 participants; high‐certainty evidence and also reported more severe AEs (RR 2.35, 95% CI 0.99 to 5.58; P = 0.05; 2 studies; 413 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Topical (skin) administration Four studies (305 participants) administered rapamycin topically. More participants in the intervention arm showed a response to skin lesions (RR 2.72, 95% CI 1.76 to 4.18; P < 0.00001; 2 studies; 187 participants; high‐certainty evidence) and more participants in the placebo arm reported a deterioration of skin lesions (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.49; 1 study; 164 participants; high‐certainty evidence). More participants in the intervention arm responded to facial angiofibroma at one to three months (RR 28.74, 95% CI 1.78 to 463.19; P = 0.02) and three to six months (RR 39.39, 95% CI 2.48 to 626.00; P = 0.009; low‐certainty evidence). Similar results were noted for cephalic plaques at one to three months (RR 10.93, 95% CI 0.64 to 186.08; P = 0.10) and three to six months (RR 7.38, 95% CI 1.01 to 53.83; P = 0.05; low‐certainty evidence). More participants on placebo showed a deterioration of skin lesions (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.49; P < 0.0001; 1 study; 164 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The intervention arm reported a higher general improvement score (MD ‐1.01, 95% CI ‐1.68 to ‐0.34; P < 0.0001), but no difference specifically in the adult subgroup (MD ‐0.75, 95% CI ‐1.58 to 0.08; P = 0.08; 1 study; 36 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Participants in the intervention arm reported higher satisfaction than with placebo (MD ‐0.92, 95% CI ‐1.79 to ‐0.05; P = 0.04; 1 study; 36 participants; low‐certainty evidence), although again with no difference among adults (MD ‐0.25, 95% CI ‐1.52 to 1.02; P = 0.70; 1 study; 18 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Groups did not differ in change in quality of life at six months (MD 0.30, 95% CI ‐1.01 to 1.61; P = 0.65; 1 study; 62 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Treatment led to a higher risk of any AE compared to placebo (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.10, 2.67; P = 0.02; 3 studies; 277 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); but no difference between groups in severe AEs (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.19 to 3.15; P = 0.73; 1 study; 179 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions Oral everolimus reduces the size of SEGA and renal angiomyolipoma by 50%, reduces seizure frequency by 25% and 50% and implements beneficial effects on skin lesions with no difference in the total number of AEs compared to placebo; however, more participants in the treatment group required a dose reduction, interruption or withdrawal and marginally more experienced serious AEs compared to placebo. Topical rapamycin increases the response to skin lesions and facial angiofibroma, an improvement score, satisfaction and the risk of any AE, but not severe adverse events. With caution regarding the risk of severe AEs, this review supports oral everolimus for renal angiomyolipoma, SEGA, seizure, and skin lesions, and topical rapamycin for facial angiofibroma. Plain language summary Drugs that aim to relieve clinical symptoms of tuberous sclerosis complex Review question Can rapamycin or rapalogs reduce the severity of clinical symptoms in people with tuberous sclerosis complex? Background Tuberous sclerosis complex is a genetic disease caused by mutations in  TSC1  or  TSC2  genes that affects several organs such as the brain, kidneys, heart, lungs and skin. The incidence is one in approximately 6000. Previous studies have shown potential benefits of rapamycin or rapalogs for treating people with tuberous sclerosis complex. Although everolimus (a rapalog) is currently approved by the FDA (USA Food and Drug Administration) and EMA (European Medicines Agency) for tumours associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (renal angiomyolipoma and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma), the use of these drugs for treating other symptoms of the condition has not yet been established. This review aims to bring together clinical trials in this area to establish the clinical value of rapamycin and rapalogs for various symptoms of tuberous sclerosis complex. Search date The evidence is current to: 15 July 2022. Study characteristics The review included 10 studies with 1008 people with tuberous sclerosis complex aged between three months and 65 years of age .  However, one study involved five people with sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (without tuberous sclerosis complex) who we could not remove from the analysis. Studies compared rapamycin or rapalogs with placebo (containing no active ingredient) and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly. The duration of the studies was variable. Two studies were funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals. Key results Oral everolimus (rapalog) increased the number of people who achieved a 50% reduction in the size of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma and renal angiomyolipoma, as well as 25% and 50% reduction in seizure frequency. Oral everolimus also showed benefit in terms of response to skin lesions. However, those who received the systemic treatment probably had a higher risk of experiencing any adverse events as compared to those who did not receive treatment. More people receiving the systemic treatment had severe adverse events and adverse events that cause them to withdraw from the trial, temporarily stop treatment or reduce their dose compared to people receiving placebo. Topical rapamycin increased the proportion of people who reported response to any skin lesions and probably facial angiofibroma. Absence of topical rapamycin increased the proportion of people who reported deterioration to any skin lesions. The topical rapamycin was also shown to increase improvement score and satisfaction. However, those who received the topical treatment probably had a higher risk of experiencing any adverse events, but not severe adverse events, compared to those who did not receive treatment. Certainty of the evidence All of the included studies generally showed a low risk of bias in study design. Four of these studies showed high risk of bias in a few areas of study design, such as whether participants knew if they were given the treatment or placebo and incomplete data in the final analyses. In eight of the studies, we need important information from trial authors in several study design areas in order to make quality judgements on those areas, such as whether people knew which group they would be put into, whether participants knew if they were given the treatment or placebo, whether research personnel knew if participants receive the treatment or placebo, whether the person who assess the effect of intervention knew if participants receive the treatment or placebo, and incomplete data in final analyses. In eight studies, some authors who are employees, stock owners, consultants, or received grants from the manufacturers of the investigational products were involved in the study design, discussion, research, overseeing of data collection and data analysis and interpretation. These studies were also supported by manufacturers of the investigational products. The evidence from studies using systemic administration showed mixed levels of certainty. We found high‐certainty evidence for 50% reduction in the size of renal angiomyolipoma, response to skin lesions, and adverse events. Outcomes related to 50% reduction in the size of SEGA, frequency of seizure, and number of participants with increased creatinine level were judged as having moderate‐certainty evidence. Outcomes related to participants' well‐being were of low‐certainty evidence. The evidence from studies using topical administration also showed mixed levels of certainty. We found high‐certainty evidence for improvements in any skin lesions. We found moderate‐certainty evidence for adverse events. Outcomes on response to facial angiofibroma, cephalic plaque, and participants' well‐being were of low‐certainty evidence.","7","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Angiofibroma; *Angiomyolipoma; *Astrocytoma [drug therapy]; *Kidney Neoplasms [drug therapy]; *Tuberous Sclerosis [complications, drug therapy]; Adult; Everolimus [adverse effects]; Humans; MTOR Inhibitors; Male; Sirolimus [adverse effects]","10.1002/14651858.CD011272.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011272.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

This is an updated review. Objectives Does giving antibiotics for  P aeruginosa  infection in people with CF at the time of new isolation improve clinical outcomes (e.g. mortality, quality of life and morbidity), eradicate  P aeruginosa  infection, and delay the onset of chronic infection, but without adverse effects, compared to usual treatment or an alternative antibiotic regimen? We also assessed cost‐effectiveness. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and conference proceedings. Latest search: 24 March 2022. We searched ongoing trials registries. Latest search: 6 April 2022. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of people with CF, in whom  P aeruginosa  had recently been isolated from respiratory secretions. We compared combinations of inhaled, oral or intravenous (IV) antibiotics with placebo, usual treatment or other antibiotic combinations. We excluded non‐randomised trials and cross‐over trials. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Main results We included 11 trials (1449 participants) lasting between 28 days and 27 months; some had few participants and most had relatively short follow‐up periods. Antibiotics in this review are: oral – ciprofloxacin and azithromycin; inhaled – tobramycin nebuliser solution for inhalation (TNS), aztreonam lysine (AZLI) and colistin; IV – ceftazidime and tobramycin. There was generally a low risk of bias from missing data. In most trials it was difficult to blind participants and clinicians to treatment. Two trials were supported by the manufacturers of the antibiotic used. TNS versus placebo TNS may improve eradication; fewer participants were still positive for  P aeruginosa  at one month (odds ratio (OR) 0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.18; 3 trials, 89 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and two months (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.65; 2 trials, 38 participants). We are uncertain whether the odds of a positive culture decrease at 12 months (OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.67; 1 trial, 12 participants). TNS (28 days) versus TNS (56 days) One trial (88 participants) comparing 28 days to 56 days TNS treatment found duration of treatment may make little or no difference in time to next isolation (hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.76; low‐certainty evidence). Cycled TNS versus culture‐based TNS One trial (304 children, one to 12 years old) compared cycled TNS to culture‐based therapy and also ciprofloxacin to placebo. We found moderate‐certainty evidence of an effect favouring cycled TNS therapy (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.82), although the trial publication reported age‐adjusted OR and no difference between groups. Ciprofloxacin versus placebo added to cycled and culture‐based TNS therapy One trial (296 participants) examined the effect of adding ciprofloxacin versus placebo to cycled and culture‐based TNS therapy. There is probably no difference between ciprofloxacin and placebo in eradicating  P aeruginosa  (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.44; moderate‐certainty evidence). Ciprofloxacin and colistin versus TNS We are uncertain whether there is any difference between groups in eradication of  P aeruginosa  at up to six months (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.23; 1 trial, 58 participants) or up to 24 months (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.42; 1 trial, 47 participants); there was a low rate of short‐term eradication in both groups. Ciprofloxacin plus colistin versus ciprofloxacin plus TNS One trial (223 participants) found there may be no difference in positive respiratory cultures at 16 months between ciprofloxacin with colistin versus TNS with ciprofloxacin (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.29; low‐certainty evidence). TNS plus azithromycin compared to TNS plus oral placebo Adding azithromycin may make no difference to the number of participants eradicating  P aeruginosa  after a three‐month treatment phase (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.35; 1 trial, 91 participants; low‐certainty evidence); there was also no evidence of any difference in the time to recurrence. Ciprofloxacin and colistin versus no treatment A single trial only reported one of our planned outcomes; there were no adverse effects in either group. AZLI for 14 days plus placebo for 14 days compared to AZLI for 28 days We are uncertain whether giving 14 or 28 days of AZLI makes any difference to the proportion of participants having a negative respiratory culture at 28 days (mean difference (MD) ‐7.50, 95% CI ‐24.80 to 9.80; 1 trial, 139 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Ceftazidime with IV tobramycin compared with ciprofloxacin (both regimens in conjunction with three months colistin) IV ceftazidime with tobramycin compared with ciprofloxacin may make little or no difference to eradication of  P aeruginosa  at three months, sustained to 15 months, provided that inhaled antibiotics are also used (RR 0.84, 95 % CI 0.65 to 1.09; P = 0.18; 1 trial, 255 participants; high‐certainty evidence). The results do not support using IV antibiotics over oral therapy to eradicate  P aeruginosa , based on both eradication rate and financial cost. Authors' conclusions We found that nebulised antibiotics, alone or with oral antibiotics, were better than no treatment for early infection with  P aeruginosa . Eradication may be sustained in the short term. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether these antibiotic strategies decrease mortality or morbidity, improve quality of life, or are associated with adverse effects compared to placebo or standard treatment. Four trials comparing two active treatments have failed to show differences in rates of eradication of  P aeruginosa . One large trial showed that intravenous ceftazidime with tobramycin is not superior to oral ciprofloxacin when inhaled antibiotics are also used. There is still insufficient evidence to state which antibiotic strategy should be used for the eradication of early  P aeruginosa  infection in CF, but there is now evidence that intravenous therapy is not superior to oral antibiotics. Plain language summary Different ways of giving antibiotics to clear  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  infection in people with cystic fibrosis Key messages ‐ Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited condition where the airways often become blocked with mucus, and people with CF are more likely to get chest infections which cause more damage to the lungs. ‐ Pseudomonas aeruginosa  ( P aeruginosa ) is often the cause of infection and is difficult to get rid of; antibiotics are the main treatment, but there are many different antibiotics, and they can be given in different ways. ‐ Inhaled antibiotics may be better than no treatment allowing most people to remain free of  P aeruginosa  after one month. ‐ There seems to be little difference in the other treatments we compared regarding how well they clear  P aeruginosa  from the lungs. What is cystic fibrosis? CF is the most common inherited condition that is life‐limiting. Sticky mucus builds up in the lungs of people with CF, which makes it difficult to breathe and can lead to chest infections. These chest infections can cause further lung damage and lead to breathing failure and death. A germ called  P aeruginosa  is often the cause of infection and is difficult to treat successfully, once it has persisted for longer than six months. What did we want to find out? We wanted to compare different combinations of inhaled, oral and intravenous (IV) antibiotics for clearing  P aeruginosa  in people with CF, to see if any single treatment works best and is more cost‐effective. What did we find? The review includes 11 studies with a total of 1449 people with CF, of any age or sex, who had mild to severe lung disease. The studies lasted from 28 days to 27 months. We could not combine many results as studies used different treatments. There were 10 different comparisons of antibiotic treatments: three studies compared inhaled antibiotics with a placebo (dummy treatment); two studies compared inhaled antibiotics for different lengths of time; two studies compared inhaled tobramycin with or without oral antibiotics depending on how the infection was detected; two studies compared inhaled antibiotics plus an oral antibiotic with inhaled antibiotics plus a placebo; one study compared two different inhaled antibiotics plus an oral antibiotic; and one study compared IV antibiotics with oral antibiotics. Most of the studies showed how well the treatments got rid of  P aeruginosa  as well as how they affected lung function, other germs, worsening of flare‐ups, and side effects. Main results Three small studies (of 89 people) treating early infection showed that after one month, inhaled antibiotics were better than no treatment and cleared  P aeruginosa  in most people, but our confidence in the evidence is low. There is likely to be little difference in the other treatments regarding how well they clear  P aeruginosa  from the lungs, although we found that inhaled antibiotics, alone or with oral antibiotics, were better than no treatment for early infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A study of IV ceftazidime with tobramycin in comparison with oral ciprofloxacin also showed neither group was better at getting rid of  P aeruginosa,  but we are more certain of the results and this means that it may be just as effective to treat with oral antibiotics. What are the limitations of the evidence? Some studies were carried out up to 30 years ago and the results may not apply today, and some studies were small. Most studies were quite short, so we could not show whether treatment made people with CF feel better or live longer. Given the treatments used in most of the studies, it would have been easy for people to guess which treatment they were receiving, which might have influenced some of the results. Two studies were supported by the pharmaceutical industry. Further research is needed to see whether clearing the infection completely improves the well‐being and quality of life in people with CF and to establish which antibiotic combination is best at clearing  P aeruginosa . Overall our confidence in the evidence was moderate to very low, so further research is likely to change our confidence in the results. However, we have higher confidence in one recently published study, which means we can be more sure of the results. How up to date is this evidence? The studies we have reported on are the most up‐to‐date we could find.

"CD012349.PUB3","Geneen, LJ; Dorée, C; Estcourt, LJ","Interventions for improving adherence to iron chelation therapy in people with sickle cell disease or thalassaemia","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2023","Abstract - Background Regularly transfused people with sickle cell disease (SCD) and people with thalassaemia are at risk of iron overload. Iron overload can lead to iron toxicity in vulnerable organs such as the heart, liver and endocrine glands, which can be prevented and treated with iron‐chelating agents. The intensive demands and uncomfortable side effects of therapy can have a negative impact on daily activities and wellbeing, which may affect adherence. Objectives To identify and assess the effectiveness of different types of interventions (psychological and psychosocial, educational, medication interventions, or multi‐component interventions) and interventions specific to different age groups, to improve adherence to iron chelation therapy compared to another listed intervention, or standard care in people with SCD or thalassaemia. Search methods We searched CENTRAL (Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ProQuest Dissertations & Global Theses, Web of Science & Social Sciences Conference Proceedings Indexes and ongoing trial databases (13 December 2021). We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register (1 August 2022). Selection criteria For trials comparing medications or medication changes, only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible for inclusion. For studies including psychological and psychosocial interventions, educational interventions, or multi‐component interventions, non‐randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs), controlled before‐after studies, and interrupted time series studies with adherence as a primary outcome were also eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis For this update, two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Main results We included 19 RCTs and one NRSI published between 1997 and 2021. One trial assessed medication management, one assessed an education intervention (NRSI) and 18 RCTs were of medication interventions. Medications assessed were subcutaneous deferoxamine, and two oral chelating agents, deferiprone and deferasirox. We rated the certainty of evidence as very low to low across all outcomes identified in this review. Four trials measured quality of life (QoL) with validated instruments, but provided no analysable data and reported no difference in QoL. We identified nine comparisons of interest. 1. Deferiprone versus deferoxamine We are uncertain whether or not deferiprone affects adherence to iron chelation therapy (four RCTs, unpooled, very low‐certainty evidence), all‐cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 1.21; 3 RCTs, 376 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), or serious adverse events (SAEs) (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.46; 1 RCT, 228 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).  Adherence was reported as ""good"", ""high"" or ""excellent"" by all seven trials, though the data could not be analysed formally: adherence ranged from 69% to 95% (deferiprone, mean 86.6%), and 71% to 93% (deferoxamine, mean 78.8%), based on five trials (474 participants) only. 2. Deferasirox versus deferoxamine We are uncertain whether or not deferasirox affects adherence to iron chelation therapy (three RCTs, unpooled, very low‐certainty evidence), although medication adherence was high in all trials. We are uncertain whether or not there is any difference between the drug therapies in serious adverse events (SAEs) (SCD or thalassaemia) or all‐cause mortality (thalassaemia). 3. Deferiprone versus deferasirox We are uncertain if there is a difference between oral deferiprone and deferasirox based on a single trial in children (average age 9 to 10 years) with any hereditary haemoglobinopathy in adherence, SAEs and all‐cause mortality. 4. Deferasirox film‐coated tablet (FCT) versus deferasirox dispersible tablet (DT) One RCT compared deferasirox in different tablet forms. There may be a preference for FCTs, shown through a trend for greater adherence (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.22; 1 RCT, 88 participants), although medication adherence was high in both groups (FCT 92.9%; DT 85.3%). We are uncertain if there is a benefit in chelation‐related AEs with FCTs. We are uncertain if there is a difference in the incidence of SAEs, all‐cause mortality or sustained adherence. 5. Deferiprone and deferoxamine combined versus deferiprone alone We are uncertain if there is a difference in adherence, though reporting was usually narrative as triallists report it was ""excellent"" in both groups (three RCTs, unpooled). We are uncertain if there is a difference in the incidence of SAEs and all‐cause mortality.  6. Deferiprone and deferoxamine combined versus deferoxamine alone We are uncertain if there is a difference in adherence (four RCTs), SAEs (none reported in the trial period) and all‐cause mortality (no deaths reported in the trial period). There was high adherence in all trials. 7. Deferiprone and deferoxamine combined versus deferiprone and deferasirox combined There may be a difference in favour of deferiprone and deferasirox (combined) in rates of adherence (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.99) (one RCT), although it was high (> 80%) in both groups. We are uncertain if there is a difference in SAEs, and no deaths were reported in the trial, so we cannot draw conclusions based on these data (one RCT). 8. Medication management versus standard care We are uncertain if there is a difference in QoL (one RCT), and we could not assess adherence due to a lack of reporting in the control group. 9. Education versus standard care One quasi‐experimental (NRSI) study could not be analysed due to the severe baseline confounding. Authors' conclusions The medication comparisons included in this review had higher than average adherence rates not accounted for by differences in medication administration or side effects, though often follow‐up was not good (high dropout over longer trials), with adherence based on a per protocol analysis. Participants may have been selected based on higher adherence to trial medications at baseline. Also, within the clinical trial context, there is increased attention and involvement of clinicians, thus high adherence rates may be an artefact of trial participation. Real‐world, pragmatic trials in community and clinic settings are needed that examine both confirmed or unconfirmed adherence strategies that may increase adherence to iron chelation therapy. Due to lack of evidence this review cannot comment on intervention strategies for different age groups. Plain language summary Strategies to increase adherence to iron chelation therapy in people with sickle cell disease or thalassaemia Review question We wanted to determine if there are any interventions (medication, psychological or educational) that would help people adhere to their iron chelation therapy. Background People with sickle cell disease or thalassaemia, who receive regular transfusions, are exposed to iron overload that can result in toxicity to organs and death. Iron chelation therapy is used to prevent or treat iron overload, but it can be a demanding regimen, and have unwanted side effects. There are three types of iron chelators being used to treat iron overload: deferoxamine given subcutaneously (by injecting a drug into the tissue layer between the skin and the muscle), and two agents that are taken orally, deferiprone and deferasirox. Search date The evidence is current to 1 August 2022. Study characteristics We searched the literature for both randomised and non‐randomised trials, and found 19 randomised trials and one non‐randomised trial, totalling 1525 participants, published between 1997 and 2021.   Key results A total of 18 trials looked at drug interventions, one trial looked at a medication management intervention, and one assessed an education intervention (a non‐randomised trial). We were uncertain if single agents or combined agents made any difference in adherence rates, serious adverse events or mortality. Quality of life, measured using validated questionnaires, was only reported in three trials, but not enough data were reported to determine any differences between treatments. There was no evidence on intervention strategies for different age groups. We found that there was an unusually high adherence rate to all drugs and combinations of drugs in all the trials. This may be because participants may have been selected based on their ability to stick to medication regimens. Also, adherence may increase in trial participants when there is a higher level of clinician involvement in care. We concluded that real‐world randomised and non‐randomised trials, run in both the community and in clinics, are needed to examine a variety of proven and unproven strategies that may be useful for increasing adherence to iron chelation therapy. Two trials assessed non‐medication interventions: one six‐month trial of medication management reported very little usable data, and we cannot be certain of the impact of the intervention. The other trial assessing an education intervention was unbalanced, and the data did not allow a good comparison, therefore we were unable to use it. Quality (certainty) of the evidence We rated the certainty of the evidence as low to very low across all the outcomes in this review. This was due to trials being at serious or very serious risk of bias, and the outcome estimates being imprecise (wide confidence intervals) and not widely applicable (some trials were conducted only in children of a specific age and meeting specific criteria).","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Anemia, Sickle Cell [complications, drug therapy]; *Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; *Thalassemia; Chelating Agents; Chelation Therapy; Child; Deferoxamine [adverse effects]; Humans; Iron","10.1002/14651858.CD012349.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012349.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

In β‐thalassaemia there is an underproduction of β‐globin chains combined with excess of free α‐globin chains. The excess free α‐globin chains precipitate in red blood cells, leading to their increased destruction (haemolysis) and ineffective erythropoiesis. The conventional treatment is based on the correction of haemoglobin through regular red blood cell transfusions and treating the iron overload that develops subsequently with iron chelation therapy. Although, early detection and initiations of such supportive treatment has improved the quality of life for people with transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only widely available therapy with a curative potential. Gene therapy for β‐thalassaemia has recently received conditional authorisation for marketing in Europe, and may soon become widely available as another alternative therapy with curative potential for people with transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different types of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, in people with transfusion‐dependent β‐thalassaemia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched online trial registries. Date of the most recent search: 07 April 2021. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with each other or with standard therapy (regular transfusion and chelation regimen). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened trials and had planned to extract data and assess risk of bias using standard Cochrane methodologies and assess the quality using GRADE approach, but no trials were identified for inclusion in the current review. Main results No relevant trials were retrieved after a comprehensive search of the literature. Authors' conclusions We were unable to identify any randomised controlled trials or quasi‐randomised controlled trials on the effectiveness and safety of different types of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in people with transfusion‐dependent β‐thalassaemia. The absence of high‐level evidence for the effectiveness of these interventions emphasises the need for well‐designed, adequately‐powered, randomised controlled clinical trials. Plain language summary Transplantation of blood‐forming stem cells for people with transfusion‐dependent β‐thalassaemia Review question We reviewed whether different types of stem cell transplantation are safe and effective in people with transfusion‐dependent β‐thalassaemia. Background Thalassaemia is a disorder that occurs because of a mutation in either the α‐ or β‐globin genes causing decreased production of haemoglobin (a protein found in red blood cells that carries oxygen) and increased destruction of red blood cells. Decreased production of haemoglobin and destruction of red blood cells leads to anaemia and significant morbidity in affected individuals. While anaemia can be treated effectively with regular blood transfusions, repeated transfusions lead to the accumulation of iron in the body, which unless treated with iron chelation can result in multiorgan disease particularly heart and lung. These toxicities tend to accumulate over time leading to reduced quality of life and early death. Additionally, blood transfusions do not provide a cure. The use of hematopoietic (blood‐forming) stem cell transplantation involves replacing the unhealthy hematopoietic stem cells with normal hematopoietic stem cells from either a healthy donor (allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) or genetically correcting the recipient's own cells and reinfusing them back into the individual (autologous gene therapy). These stem cells then produce normal red blood cells containing normal amounts of globin chains and thus ameliorate anaemia. Search date The evidence is current to: 07 April 2021.

"CD003149.PUB4","Estcourt, LJ; Kimber, C; Trivella, M; Doree, C; Hopewell, S","Preoperative blood transfusions for sickle cell disease","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2020","Abstract - Background Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders in the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end‐organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Surgical interventions are more common in people with SCD, and occur at much younger ages than in the general population. Blood transfusions are frequently used prior to surgery and several regimens are used but there is no consensus over the best method or the necessity of transfusion in specific surgical cases. This is an update of a Cochrane Review. Objectives To determine whether there is evidence that preoperative blood transfusion in people with SCD undergoing elective or emergency surgery reduces mortality and perioperative or sickle cell‐related serious adverse events. To compare the effectiveness of different transfusion regimens (aggressive or conservative) if preoperative transfusions are indicated in people with SCD. Search methods We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980), and ongoing trial databases; all searches current to 28 January 2020 We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register: 19 September 2019. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing preoperative blood transfusion regimens to different regimens or no transfusion in people with SCD undergoing elective or emergency surgery. There was no restriction by outcomes examined, language or publication status. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and the risk of bias and extracted data. Main results Three trials with 990 participants were eligible for inclusion in the review. There were no ongoing trials identified. These trials were conducted between 1988 and 2011. The majority of people included had haemoglobin (Hb) SS SCD. The majority of surgical procedures were considered low or intermediate risk for developing sickle cell‐related complications. Aggressive versus simple red blood cell transfusions One trial (551 participants) compared an aggressive transfusion regimen (decreasing sickle haemoglobin to less than 30%) to a simple transfusion regimen (increasing haemoglobin to 100 g/L). This trial re‐randomised participants and therefore quantitative analysis was only possible on two subsets of data: participants undergoing cholecystectomy (230 participants); and participants undergoing tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy surgeries (107 participants). Data were not combined as we do not know if any participant received both surgeries. Overall, the quality of the evidence was very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to the trial being at high risk of bias primarily due to lack of blinding, indirectness and the outcome estimates being imprecise. Cholecystectomy subgroup results are reported in the abstract. Results for both subgroups were similar. There was no difference in all‐cause mortality between people receiving aggressive transfusions and those receiving conservative transfusions. No deaths occurred in either subgroup. There were no differences between the aggressive transfusion group and conservative transfusion group in the number of people developing: • an acute chest syndrome, risk ratio (RR) 0.84 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.84) (one trial, 230 participants, very low‐quality evidence); • vaso‐occlusive crisis, risk ratio 0.30 (95% CI 0.09 to 1.04) (one trial, 230 participants, very low quality evidence); • serious infection, risk ratio 1.75 (95% CI 0.59 to 5.18) (one trial, 230 participants, very low‐quality evidence); • any perioperative complications, RR 0.75 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.55) (one trial, 230 participants, very low‐quality evidence); • a transfusion‐related complication, RR 1.85 (95% CI 0.89 to 3.88) (one trial, 230 participants, very low‐quality evidence). Preoperative transfusion versus no preoperative transfusion Two trials (434 participants) compared a preoperative transfusion plus standard care to a group receiving standard care. Overall, the quality of the evidence was low to very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to the trials being at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, and outcome estimates being imprecise. One trial was stopped early because more people in the no transfusion arm developed an acute chest syndrome. There was no difference in all‐cause mortality between people receiving preoperative transfusions and those receiving no preoperative transfusions (two trials, 434 participants, no deaths occurred). There was significant heterogeneity between the two trials in the number of people developing an acute chest syndrome, a meta‐analysis was therefore not performed. One trial showed a reduced number of people developing acute chest syndrome between people receiving preoperative transfusions and those receiving no preoperative transfusions, risk ratio 0.11 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.80) (65 participants), whereas the other trial did not, RR 4.81 (95% CI 0.23 to 99.61) (369 participants). There were no differences between the preoperative transfusion groups and the groups without preoperative transfusion in the number of people developing: • a vaso‐occlusive crisis, Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.91 (95% confidence interval 0.61 to 6.04) (two trials, 434 participants, very low‐quality evidence). • a serious infection, Peto OR 1.29 (95% CI 0.29 to 5.71) (two trials, 434 participants, very low‐quality evidence); • any perioperative complications, RR 0.24 (95% CI 0.03 to 2.05) (one trial, 65 participants, low‐quality evidence). There was an increase in the number of people developing circulatory overload in those receiving preoperative transfusions compared to those not receiving preoperative transfusions in one of the two trials, and no events were seen in the other trial (no meta‐analysis performed). Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to determine whether conservative preoperative blood transfusion is as effective as aggressive preoperative blood transfusion in preventing sickle‐related or surgery‐related complications in people with HbSS disease. There is very low quality evidence that preoperative blood transfusion may prevent development of acute chest syndrome. Due to lack of evidence this review cannot comment on management for people with HbSC or HbSβ +  disease or for those with high baseline haemoglobin concentrations. Plain language summary Blood transfusions for people with sickle cell disease before they undergo surgery Review question We wanted to determine if blood transfusions given to people with sickle cell disease before routine or emergency surgery prevent complications due to sickle cell disease or surgery without causing any severe side effects. We also wanted to determine if any particular type of transfusion regimen is better in people with sickle cell disease undergoing surgery. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Background Sickle cell disease is a serious inherited blood disorder where the red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body, develop abnormally. The disorder mainly affects people of African, Caribbean, Middle Eastern, Eastern Mediterranean and Asian origin. Normal red blood cells are flexible and disc‐shaped, but in sickle cell disease they can become rigid and crescent shaped. Sickled cells are not only less flexible than healthy red blood cells, they are also stickier. This can lead to blockage of blood vessels, resulting in tissue and organ damage and episodes of severe pain. The abnormal blood cells are more fragile and break apart, which leads to a shortage of red blood cells, known as anaemia. People with sickle cell disease are more likely to require surgery than the general population because of complications due to sickle cell disease, such as gallstones, infections, and joint problems. However, surgery can lead to sickle cell‐related complications. Blood transfusions before an operation may help prevent complications by reducing the level of anaemia, diluting the sickled red blood cells, and increasing the level of oxygen in the blood.This may reduce the risk of blood vessels becoming blocked causing further damage. There are different types of blood transfusions. The main aim of an aggressive transfusion regimen is to reduce the number of sickled cells in the blood to below a certain level (usually sickled cells are removed and donor red cells given (exchange transfusion)), it also reduces the level of anaemia. The main aim of a conservative transfusion regimen is to reduce the level of anaemia, it also reduces the percentage of sickled cells in the blood (dilution effect) but no sickled cells are removed. An aggressive transfusion regimen decreases the percentage of sickled cells in the blood to a much lower level than a conservative transfusion regimen. Blood transfusions can be linked to adverse events such as: the development of antibodies to proteins on donor red cells (alloimmunisation); accumulation of too much iron in the body from repeated transfusions; increased infection rates after surgery; and extended length of stay in hospital. Some types of surgery may not require blood transfusion. Study characteristics We searched the medical literature to 28 January 2020. We included three trials with 990 people in this review. One trial compared aggressive transfusion to conservative transfusion. Two trials compared aggressive or conservative transfusion before surgery to no transfusion. The majority of people within the trials had one form of sickle cell disease (HbSS). The majority of the operations were those considered to be at low or intermediate risk for causing sickle cell‐related complications. Two of the three trials received government funding, the third trial did not report the funding source. Key results There was no difference between giving a blood transfusion before surgery to reduce the number of sickled cells below a certain low level (aggressive transfusion regimen) and giving a blood transfusion to increase the number of red cells in the blood (conservative transfusion regimen) in preventing surgical or sickle‐related complications immediately after surgery. Giving a blood transfusion before surgery may prevent development of sickle‐related lung problems. One trial was stopped early because more people developed sickle‐related lung problems in the no transfusion arm; however, the other trial did not show a difference.There was no difference between giving a blood transfusion before surgery compared to not giving a blood transfusion before surgery in preventing any other sickle‐related or surgical complications immediately after surgery. Quality of the evidence The quality of evidence was rated as very low for this review's outcomes due to trials being at high risk of bias and because their was a small number of trials and a small number of participants included in the trials.","7","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Hemoglobin, Sickle; Acute Chest Syndrome [etiology]; Adenoidectomy; Anemia, Sickle Cell [blood, complications, *surgery]; Blood Transfusion [*methods]; Cholecystectomy [adverse effects]; Humans; Preoperative Care [*methods]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Tonsillectomy; Transfusion Reaction","10.1002/14651858.CD003149.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003149.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Prophylaxis has long been used, but not universally adopted, because of medical, psychosocial, and cost controversies. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of clotting factor concentrate prophylaxis in managing previously‐treated individuals with hemophilia A or B. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. In addition, we searched MEDLINE and Embase and online trial registries. Most recent search of Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register: 24 February 2021. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs evaluating people with hemophilia A or hemophilia B, who were previously treated with clotting factor concentrates to manage their hemophilia. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently reviewed trials for eligibility, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. The authors used the GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence. Main results Ten trials (including 608 participants) were eligible for inclusion. Eight of the trials (477 participants) had arms comparing two or more prophylactic regimens to one another and four of the trials (n = 258) compared prophylaxis to on‐demand treatment (two trials had multiple arms and were included in both comparisons). Comparison of two or more prophylactic regimens For trials comparing one prophylaxis regimen to another, given the heterogeneity of the data, none of the data were pooled for this comparison. Considering the individual trials, three trials reported the primary outcome of joint bleeding, and none showed a dfference between dosing regimens (low‐certainty evidence). For the secondary outcome of total bleeding events, prophylaxis with a twice‐weekly regimen of FIX likely results in reduced total bleeds compared to a once‐a‐week regimen of the same dose, mean difference (MD) 11.2 (5.81 to 16.59) (one trial, 10 participants, low‐certainty evidence). Transient low‐titer anti‐FVIII inhibitors were reported in one of the trials. Blood‐transmitted infections were not identified. Other adverse events reported include hypersensitivity, oedema, and weight gain. These were, however, rare and unrelated to study drugs (very low‐certainty evidence). Comparison of prophylactic and on‐demand regimens Four of the trials (258 participants) had arms that compared prophylaxis to on‐demand treatment. Prophylaxis may result in a large decrease in the number of joint bleeds compared to on‐demand treatment, MD ‐30.34 (95% CI ‐46.95 to ‐13.73) (two trials, 164 participants, low‐certainty evidence). One of these trials (84 participants) also reported the long‐term effects of prophylaxis versus on‐demand therapy showing improved joint function, quality of life, and pain; but no differences between groups in joint structure when assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In one trial (84 participants) validated measures for joint health and pain assessment showed that prophylaxis likely improves joint health compared to an on‐demand regimen with an estimated change difference of 0.94 points (95% CI 0.23 to 1.65) and improves total pain scores, MD ‐17.20 (95% CI ‐27.48 to ‐6.92 (moderate‐certainty evidence). Two trials (131 participants) reported that prophylaxis likely results in a slight increase in adverse events, risk ratio 1.71 (1.24 to 2.37) (moderate‐certainty evidence). No inhibitor development and blood‐transmitted infections were identified. Overall, the certainty of the body of evidence was judged to be low because of different types of bias that could have altered the effect.   Authors' conclusions There is evidence from RCTs that prophylaxis, as compared to on‐demand treatment, may reduce bleeding frequency in previously‐treated people with hemophilia. Prophylaxis may also improve joint function, pain and quality of life, even though this does not translate into a detectable improvement of articular damage when assessed by MRI.  When comparing two different prophylaxis regimens, no significant differences in terms of protection from bleeding were found. Dose optimization could, however, result in improved efficacy. Given the heterogeneity of the data, pooled estimates were not obtained for most comparisons.  Well‐designed RCTs and prospective observational controlled studies with standardised definitions and measurements are needed to establish the optimal and most cost‐effective treatment regimens. Plain language summary Regular clotting factor replacement therapy to prevent joint damage in people living with severe hemophilia A or B Review question Should people, who have previously been treated for joint bleeding, be given regular preventative treatment with clotting factor concentrates to manage their condition? Background Hemophilia A and B are X‐linked inherited bleeding disorders in which bleeding  into joints is a major problem. Repeated joint bleeds can lead to affected joints (commonly referred to as 'target joints') becoming damaged and painful, with limited movement. Currently, bleeding is treated and prevented with plasma‐derived or recombinant clotting factor concentrates, and more recently non‐clotting factor formulations. This review looked at how useful and effective different clotting factor treatment strategies are for preventing joint bleeding and other outcomes in previously treated people with hemophilia A or B. Search date Date of last search: 24 February 2021. Study characteristics This review includes 10 randomised controlled trials. Eight had treatment arms that compared the regular use of clotting factor concentrates to prevent joint bleeds with different dosing schemes to identify regimens that may be better; four had treatment arms that compared the regular use of factor concentrates to prevent bleeds to their 'on demand' use to treat bleeds once they occur (two trials had multiple arms and were included in both comparisons). Key results In people living with hemophilia A or B previously treated for joint bleeding or with existing joint damage, preventive therapy may reduce the number of joint bleeds compared to 'on‐demand therapy'. This reduction in bleeds may lead to an improvement in joint function, pain, and quality of life. However, preventive therapy is linked to an increased use of factor concentrates and therefore higher treatment costs. Further studies are needed to establish the best preventive course of treatment in terms of starting time, frequency and dose level. Certainty of the evidence Overall, the certainty of the evidence was judged to be low because of different types of bias that could have affected the results. Future research might have an important role in changing our confidence in these results.","8","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Pharmaceutical Preparations; Blood Coagulation Factors [*therapeutic use]; Factor VIII [*therapeutic use]; Hemarthrosis [*prevention & control]; Hemophilia A [*complications]; Hemophilia B [*complications]; Humans","10.1002/14651858.CD014201","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD014201","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Advantages of combination therapy include wider range of modes of action, possible synergy and reduction of resistant organisms; advantages of monotherapy include lower cost, ease of administration and reduction of drug‐related toxicity. Current evidence does not provide a clear answer and the use of intravenous antibiotic therapy in CF requires further evaluation. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of single compared to combination intravenous anti‐pseudomonal antibiotic therapy for treating people with CF. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Most recent search of the Group's Trials Register: 07 October 2020. We also searched online trials registries on 16 November 2020. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a single intravenous anti‐pseudomonal antibiotic with a combination of that antibiotic plus a second anti‐pseudomonal antibiotic in people with CF. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We assessed the certainty of the data using GRADE. Main results We identified 59 trials, of which we included eight trials (356 participants) comparing a single anti‐pseudomonal agent to a combination of the same antibiotic and one other. There was a wide variation in the individual antibiotics used in each trial. In total, the trials included seven comparisons of a beta‐lactam antibiotic (penicillin‐related or third generation cephalosporin) with a beta‐lactam‐aminoglycoside combination and three comparisons of an aminoglycoside with a beta‐lactam‐aminoglycoside combination.  There was considerable heterogeneity amongst these trials, leading to difficulties in performing the review and interpreting the results. These results should be interpreted cautiously. Six of the included trials were published between 1977 and 1988; these were single‐centre trials with flaws in the randomisation process and small sample size. Overall, the methodological quality was poor and the certainty of the evidence ranged from low to moderate. The review did not find any differences between monotherapy and combination therapy in either the short term or in the long term for the outcomes of different lung function measures, bacteriological outcome measures, need for additional treatment, adverse effects, quality of life or symptom scores. Authors' conclusions The results of this review are inconclusive. The review raises important methodological issues. There is a need for an RCT which needs to be well‐designed in terms of adequate randomisation allocation, blinding, power and long‐term follow‐up. Results need to be standardised to a consistent method of reporting, in order to validate the pooling of results from multiple trials. Plain language summary A comparison of single and combined intravenous drug therapy for people with cystic fibrosis infected with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa Review question We reviewed the evidence about the different effects of using a single intravenous (given directly into a vein) antibiotic compared to using a combination of intravenous antibiotics in people with cystic fibrosis infected with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Background Cystic fibrosis is a serious genetic disease that affects cells in the exocrine glands (sweat glands and others). People with cystic fibrosis have a greater risk of chronic lung infections, often due to bacteria called  Pseudomonas aeruginosa . They receive antibiotics, either a single drug or a combination of different drugs, given into a vein to treat these infections. Both the choice of antibiotic and the use of single or combined therapy vary. We looked for randomised controlled trials which compared a single intravenous antibiotic with a combination of that antibiotic plus another one in people with cystic fibrosis. This is an updated version of the review. Search date The evidence is current to: 07 October 2020. Study characteristics We included eight trials with a total of 356 people. Six of these were published before 1988, were each based in a single centre and used a range of different drugs. These factors made it difficult to combine and analyse the results. Key results We did not find any differences between the two therapies for lung function, bacteriological outcomes, side effects or symptom scores. We do not think that there is enough evidence to compare the different therapies properly. More research is needed, particularly looking at side effects of treatment. Quality of the evidence We judged the certainty of the evidence to be low to moderate. Six of the included trials were quite old (published between 1977 and 1988). They did not include many people and had flaws in the way the people taking part were put into the different treatment groups. Overall, the quality of the trials' design was poor.","6","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Adult; Aminoglycosides [administration & dosage]; Anti-Bacterial Agents [*administration & dosage]; Bacterial Infections [*drug therapy]; Cephalosporins [administration & dosage]; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Drug Therapy, Combination [methods]; Humans; Injections, Intravenous; Pseudomonas Infections [*drug therapy]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Tract Infections [*drug therapy]; beta-Lactams [administration & dosage]","10.1002/14651858.CD002007.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002007.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

The resultant accumulation of dermatan sulphate causes lysosomal damage. The clinical symptoms are related to skeletal dysplasia (i.e. short stature and degenerative joint disease). Other manifestations include cardiac disease, impaired pulmonary function, ophthalmological complications, hepatosplenomegaly, sinusitis, otitis, hearing loss and sleep apnea. Intellectual impairment is generally absent. Clinical manifestation is typically by two or three years of age; however, slowly progressive cases may not present until adulthood. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with galsulfase is considered a new approach for treating MPS VI. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of treating MPS VI by ERT with galsulfase compared to other interventions, placebo or no intervention. Search methods Eletronic searches were performed on the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register. Date of the latest search:  09 June 2021. Further searches of the following databases were also performed: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, LILACS, the Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. Date of the latest search: 20 August 2021. Selection criteria Randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled clinical studies of ERT with galsulfase compared to other interventions or placebo. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened the studies, assessed the risk of bias, extracted data and assessed the certainty of the the evidence using the GRADE criteria. Main results One study was included involving 39 participants who received either ERT with galsulfase (recombinant human arylsulphatase B) or placebo. This small study was considered overall to have an unclear risk of bias in relation to the design and implementation of the study, since the authors did not report how both the allocation generation and concealment were performed. Given the very low certainty of the evidence, we are uncertain whether at 24 weeks there was a difference between groups in relation to the 12‐minute walk test, mean difference (MD) of 92.00 meters (95% confidence interval (CI) 11.00 to 172.00), or the three‐minute stair climb, MD 5.70 (95% CI ‐0.10 to 11.50). In relation to respiratory tests, we are uncertain whether galsulfase makes any difference as compared to placebo in forced vital capacity in litres (FVC (L) (absolute change in baseline), given the very low certainty of the evidence. Cardiac function was not reported in the included study. We found that galsulfase, as compared to placebo, may decrease urinary glycosaminoglycan levels at 24 weeks, MD ‐227.00 (95% CI ‐264.00 to ‐190.00) (low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether there are differences between the galsulfase and placebo groups in relation to adverse events (very low‐certainty evidence) .  In general, the dose of galsulfase was well tolerated and there were no differences between groups. These events include drug‐related adverse events, serious and severe adverse events, those during infusion, drug‐related adverse events during infusion, and deaths. More infusion‐related reactions were observed in the galsulfase group and were managed with interruption or slowing of infusion rate or administration of antihistamines or corticosteroids drugs. No deaths occurred during the study.   Authors' conclusions The results of this review are based only on one small study (a 24‐week randomised phase of the study and prior to the open‐label extension). We are uncertain whether galsulfase is more effective than placebo, for treating people with MPS VI, in relation to the 12‐minute walk test or the three‐minute stair climb, as the certainty of the evidence has been assessed as very low. We found that galsulfase may reduce urinary glycosaminoglycans levels. We are also uncertain whether there are any differences between treatment groups in relation to cardiac or pulmonary functions, liver or spleen volume, overnight apnea‐hypopnea, height and weight, quality of life and adverse effects. Further studies are needed to obtain more information on the long‐term effectiveness and safety of ERT with galsulfase.  Plain language summary Enzyme replacement therapy with galsulfase for mucopolysaccharidosis type VI Review question  How effective and safe is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with galsulfase (a manufactured version of the enzyme arylsulphatase B) for treating mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI) compared to other treatments, no treatment or treatment with a placebo? Background  Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI) is a rare genetic disorder where there is a lack of the enzyme arylsulphatase B. It is a progressive and life‐limiting condition with a range of symptoms, which may include coarse facial features, reduced joint mobility, short stature and problems with the eyes, lungs and heart. Before ERT was available, it was only possible to treat the symptoms of MPS VI and not the underlying condition. Treatment with ERT allows the missing enzyme to be replaced to try to reduce the effects of the disease and prevent it getting worse.  Search date  The evidence is current to: 09 June 2021. Study characteristics  The review includes one study with 39 people with MPS VI aged between five and 20 years old. The study compared galsulfase to placebo (a substance which contains no medication) and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly. The study lasted for 24 weeks (with an extension period of an additional 24 weeks where everyone was given ERT and they knew it). Key results  The evidence for this treatment is limited because we only found and assessed the results of one small study. Given the very low certainty of the evidence, we are unsure whether galsulfase improves motor function (i.e. the ability to walk and climb stairs) in people with MPS VI. We found that treatment with galsulfase may lower levels of the chemicals associated with MPS VI (glycosaminoglycan levels) in urine tests. These results were seen in a short study and may reflect only short‐term effects. There were no differences between treatment with galsulfase and placebo in relation to adverse effects. More research is needed to study the long‐term effects on heart and lung function, quality of life and survival. Certainty of the evidence  The methods and the study design were not clearly described and the impact of this on possible bias is unclear. The certainty of the evidence has been graded as low to very low.

Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a lung disease caused by aspergillus‐induced hypersensitivity with a prevalence of 2% to 15% in people with cystic fibrosis. The mainstay of treatment includes corticosteroids and itraconazole. The treatment with corticosteroids for prolonged periods of time, or repeatedly for exacerbations of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, may lead to many adverse effects. The monoclonal anti‐IgE antibody, omalizumab, has improved asthma control in severely allergic asthmatics. The drug is given as a subcutaneous injection every two to four weeks. Since allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is also a condition resulting from hypersensitivity to specific allergens, as in asthma, it may be a candidate for therapy using anti‐IgE antibodies. Therefore, anti‐IgE therapy, using agents like omalizumab, may be a potential therapy for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis. This is an updated version of the review. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and adverse effects of anti‐IgE therapy for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Last search: 09 September 2021. We searched two ongoing trial registries (Clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO trials platform). Date of latest search: 16 August 2021. Selection criteria Randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials comparing anti‐IgE therapy to placebo or other therapies for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the included study. They planned to perform data analysis using Review Manager. Main results Only one study enrolling 14 participants was eligible for inclusion in the review. The double‐blind study compared a daily dose of 600 mg omalizumab or placebo along with twice daily itraconazole and oral corticosteroids, with a maximum daily dose of 400 mg. Treatment lasted six months but the study was terminated prematurely and complete data were not available. We contacted the study investigator and were told that the study was terminated due to the inability to recruit participants into the study despite all reasonable attempts. One or more serious side effects were encountered in six out of nine (66.67%) and one out of five (20%) participants in omalizumab group and placebo group respectively. Authors' conclusions There is lack of evidence for the efficacy and safety of anti‐IgE (omalizumab) therapy in people with cystic fibrosis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. There is a need for large prospective randomized controlled studies of anti‐IgE therapy in people with cystic fibrosis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis with both clinical and laboratory outcome measures such as steroid requirement, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis exacerbations and lung function. Plain language summary Use of anti‐IgE treatment for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of anti‐IgE therapy for treating allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Cystic fibrosis is a genetically inherited disease which is not uncommon in the Western World. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a lung disease caused by extreme sensitivity to aspergillus (a fungus) and may occur in 2% to 15% of people with cystic fibrosis. Corticosteroids and antifungal therapy are the mainstay of treatment for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, but lengthy or repeated use of corticosteroids may lead to serious side effects. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis occurs as a result of the action of IgE antibodies (a type of protein). A drug that acts against these IgE antibodies (anti‐IgE therapy), such as omalizumab, may be a possible treatment for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis. The drug is given as an injection below the skin every two to four weeks. The review aimed to show whether anti‐IgE therapy for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis is effective and to highlight any possible side effects. Search date The evidence is current to: 09 September 2021. Study characteristics We could only include one small study in the review (14 participants) and this was stopped early because not enough people agreed to join the study as volunteers. The study lasted six months and compared omalizumab (Xolair®) injections under the skin of the upper arm or the thigh to placebo injections (dummy treatment containing no active medication). Volunteers were given of 600 mg of omalizumab or placebo daily along with itraconazole (an antifungal drug) twice daily and oral corticosteroids, with a maximum daily dose of 400 mg. Key results The full results of the study were not published. Only limited results on side effects were published online. Six out of nine volunteers (66.67%) in the omalizumab group and one out of five volunteers (20%) in the placebo group reported one or more serious side effects. Due to the lack of evidence, we are not able to make recommendations either in favour of, or against the use of, anti‐IgE (omalizumab) therapy in people with cystic fibrosis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. More research into this treatment is needed.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Aspergillosis, Allergic Bronchopulmonary [drug therapy]; *Cystic Fibrosis [complications, drug therapy]; Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic; Antifungal Agents [therapeutic use]; Humans; Prospective Studies; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD010288.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010288.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Between 80% and 90% of people with CF suffer with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, which if left untreated, leads to a poor nutritional status. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) has been shown to be effective in improving nutritional status and subsequently associated with improved lung function. However, the timings of PERT administration in relation to a meal are subjective and not standardised, meaning that variations in the timing of PERT dosing persist. Objectives The primary objective of the review is to compare the efficacy (fat absorption) and effectiveness (nutritional status, lung function and quality of life) of different PERT dosing strategies in terms of timing of administration for treating dietary malabsorption in all individuals with CF. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 24 June 2021. We also searched ongoing trials registers on 09 July 2021. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross‐over RCTs with a minimum washout period of two weeks, and quasi‐RCTs of PERT dosing regimens in people (of any age) with CF. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed and screened the studies identified from the searches. We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for our pre‐specified critical outcomes, but we did not identify any eligible studies. Main results No studies met the eligibility criteria and therefore we did not include any in this review. The excluded studies were either cross‐over in design (but lacking a sufficient washout period between treatments) or did not assess the timing of PERT. One study which was terminated early is awaiting assessment pending further information. Authors' conclusions We were unable to determine whether one dosing schedule for PERT is better than another since we identified no eligible RCTs. While the introduction of PERT to people with CF can improve their nutritional status, there are a limited number of studies which address this review question, and none met our eligibility criteria. Since malnutrition and adverse gastrointestinal symptoms remain a common feature in CF, the assessment of the relative performance of dosing schedules may provide evidence to improve outcomes in people with CF who are pancreatic insufficient. Further research is needed to fully evaluate the role of dosing schedules for PERT in fat absorption. Research should also establish reliable outcome measures and minimal clinically important differences. While RCTs with a cross‐over design may have advantages over a parallel group design, an adequate washout period between intervention periods is essential. Plain language summary Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy timings in cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the different timings of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) in people (of any age) with cystic fibrosis (CF). Background CF is an inherited condition affecting over 70,000 individuals worldwide. Between 80% and 90% of people with CF are not able to produce enough pancreatic enzymes to breakdown and absorb fat, protein and fat‐soluble vitamins from food. This can lead to fatty stools (poo) and weight loss. It is thought that if fat is not digested properly, it could contribute to a higher risk of developing constipation or other serious gut complications such as distal intestinal obstruction syndrome. PERT provides the enzymes required to breakdown fat and the dosage is based upon the fat content of a meal or the person's body weight. PERT has been shown to improve weight and is associated with improved lung function. Despite current dose guidance, there are differences in PERT doses and there is no set guidance for when the therapy should be taken in relation to a meal (i.e. before, during or after eating). Search date The evidence is current to: 24 June 2021. Study characteristics We did not find any studies where PERT was given to people with CF who were pancreatic insufficient at different timings relative to their meals. We excluded nine studies. Four of these assessed the timing of PERT administration, but they had a cross‐over design where participants had one intervention and then swapped to the second intervention. We excluded these studies because they did not leave enough time between the different interventions to be sure that the effects of the first intervention were not affecting the results from the second intervention. Four studies did not look at the timing of PERT and one study evaluated a new educational program for PERT. One study was terminated early and we will assess this again at the first update of this review if we are able to obtain more information from the investigators. Key results No studies met the eligibility criteria. Further research is needed to work out the best time to take PERT in relation to a meal.","8","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Cystic Fibrosis [complications, drug therapy]; Enzyme Replacement Therapy; Humans; Nutritional Status; Pancreas","10.1002/14651858.CD013488.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013488.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Combination antimicrobial susceptibility testing assesses the efficacy of drug combinations including two or three antibiotics in vitro and can often demonstrate antimicrobial efficacy against bacterial isolates even when individual antibiotics have little or no effect. Therefore, choosing antibiotics based on combination antimicrobial susceptibility testing could potentially improve response to treatment in people with cystic fibrosis with acute exacerbations. This is an updated version of a previously published review. Objectives To compare antibiotic therapy based on conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing to antibiotic therapy based on combination antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis and chronic infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of latest search: 19 March 2020. We also searched ongoing trials registries. Date of latest search: 07 April 2020. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled studies of antibiotic therapy based on conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing compared to antibiotic therapy based on combination antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis due to chronic infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Data collection and analysis Both authors independently selected studies, assessed their quality and extracted data from eligible studies. Additionally, the authors contacted the study investigators to obtain further information. Main results The search identified one multicentre study eligible for inclusion in the review. This study prospectively assessed whether the use of multiple combination bactericidal antibiotic testing improved clinical outcomes in participants with acute pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis who were infected with multiresistant bacteria. A total of 132 participants were randomised in the study. The study investigators provided data specific to the 82 participants who were only infected with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  for their primary outcome of time until next pulmonary exacerbation. For participants specifically infected with only  Pseudomonas aeruginosa , the hazard ratio of a subsequent exacerbation was 0.82, favouring the control group (95% confidence interval 0.44 to 1.51) (P = 0.52). No further data for any of this review's outcomes specific to participants infected with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  were available. The risk of bias for the included study was deemed to be low. The quality of the evidence was moderate for the only outcome providing data solely for individuals with infection due to  Pseudomonas aeruginosa . For other outcomes, we were unable to judge the quality of the evidence as no data were available for the relevant subset of participants. Authors' conclusions The current evidence, limited to one study, shows that there is insufficient evidence to determine effect of choosing antibiotics based on combination antimicrobial susceptibility testing compared to choosing antibiotics based on conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis with chronic  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  infection. A large international and multicentre study is needed to further investigate this issue. The only study included in the review was published in 2005, and we have not identified any further relevant studies up to March 2017. We therefore do not plan to update this review until new studies are published. Plain language summary Testing antibiotics in combination for acute infections of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in cystic fibrosis Review question We compared the evidence for the effect of testing antibiotics traditionally (one at a time) compared to testing a combination of antibiotics for acute airway infections in people with long‐term (chronic) infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Background The main cause of death in people with cystic fibrosis is chronic lung infection. People with cystic fibrosis now live longer due to the aggressive use of antibiotics to treat lung infections. Traditionally, antibiotics are chosen based on the results of laboratory testing of each antibiotic separately against the bacterium (or bug) that is found in the lungs of the person with cystic fibrosis. Antibiotics tested in combination may work effectively against a bacterium even if not effective when tested alone. However, when choosing antibiotics to treat lung infections caused by  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in people with cystic fibrosis, it is unclear whether basing the choice of antibiotics on the results of combination testing is better than basing choice on the results of testing antibiotics separately. This is an updated version of a previously published review. Search date The evidence is current to: 19 March 2020. Study characteristics The search identified one study that tried to answer this question and was eligible for inclusion in the review. The study enrolled 132 people with cystic fibrosis, most of whom (82 people) had acute lung infections with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and randomly put them into two treatment groups. In the first group two antibiotics were selected following the testing of combinations of antibiotics and in the second group the two antibiotics were chosen after testing individual antibiotics to see how effective the drugs were against the bacterium. The study was run across several centres and assessed the clinical outcomes in the participants after a 14‐day course of treatment. Key results The study looked at infection with different bacteria and investigators were only able to give us results for just those who were infected with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  for their main outcome (the time until the next acute lung infection). Choosing antibiotics based on the results of combination antibiotic testing did not lead to a longer time until the next lung infection compared to choosing antibiotics based on results of separate testing. They could not provide us with any results for people infected with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  for other outcomes in our review. Quality of the evidence We are satisfied that the people taking part were divided into the different treatment groups completely at random and no one could have foreseen which group any individual would be in. We are also satisfied that during the study, neither the individuals or clinic personnel knew which treatment group each individual was in. There were no data missing from the study. The quality of the evidence for the only outcome for which we have data (time to the next lung infection) is moderate, but we could not judge the quality of the evidence for other outcomes as there were no separate results available for people infected with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa .","5","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Pseudomonas aeruginosa [drug effects]; Anti-Bacterial Agents [*therapeutic use]; Chronic Disease; Cystic Fibrosis [*microbiology]; Disease Progression; Drug Therapy, Combination; Humans; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Pseudomonas Infections [*drug therapy]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD006961.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006961.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD009529.PUB4","Lord, R; Jones, AM; Horsley, A","Antibiotic treatment for   Burkholderia cepacia complex in people with cystic fibrosis experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2020","Abstract - Background Chronic pulmonary infection is a hallmark of lung disease in cystic fibrosis. Infections dominated by organisms of the  Burkholderia cepacia  complex, a group of at least 18 closely‐related species of gram‐negative bacteria, are particularly difficult to treat. These infections may be associated with a fulminant necrotising pneumonia.  Burkholderia cepacia complex  bacteria are resistant to many common antibiotics and able to acquire resistance against many more. Following patient segregation in cystic fibrosis medical care, the more virulent epidemic strains are not as frequent, and new infections are more likely to be with less virulent environmentally‐acquired strains. Although evidence‐based guidelines exist for treating respiratory exacerbations involving  Pseudomonas aeruginosa,  these cannot be extended to  Burkholderia cepacia  complex infections. This review, which is an update of a previous review, aims to assess the available trial evidence for the choice and application of treatments for these infections. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of different antibiotic regimens in people with cystic fibrosis experiencing an exacerbation and chronically infected with organisms of the  Burkholderia cepacia  complex. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of latest search: 29 May 2019. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials of treatments for exacerbations of pulmonary symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis chronically infected with organisms of the  Burkholderia cepacia  complex. Data collection and analysis No relevant trials were identified. Main results No trials were included in this review. Authors' conclusions Burkholderia cepacia  complex infections present a significant challenge for people with cystic fibrosis and their clinicians. The incidence is likely to increase as the cystic fibrosis population ages; and managing and treating these infections will become more important. There is a lack of trial evidence to guide decision making and no conclusions can be drawn from this review about the optimal antibiotic regimens for people with cystic fibrosis who have chronic  Burkholderia cepacia  complex infections. Clinicians must continue to assess each person individually, taking into account in vitro antibiotic susceptibility data, previous clinical responses and their own experience. Multicentre randomised clinical trials are needed to assess the effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens in people with cystic fibrosis infected with organisms of the  Burkholderia cepacia  complex. Plain language summary Which antibiotics are best to treat worsening symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis with persistent  Burkholderia cepacia  complex lung infection? Review question We looked for evidence of which antibiotics are best to treat a flare up of symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis with persistent  Burkholderia cepacia  complex lung infection. Background Cystic fibrosis is a common inherited condition where the lungs often become blocked with mucus. This harms the lungs' defences and often results in chronic, persistent infections that cannot be cleared by antibiotics. People with cystic fibrosis often need courses of antibiotics to reduce their symptoms (for instance cough, excess mucus and breathlessness) when these flare up or worsen. Such episodes are called exacerbations, and are usually treated with intravenous antibiotics (given through a drip into a vein). One group of bacteria that can infect the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis is called the  Burkholderia cepacia  complex. These closely‐related bacteria are found widely in the environment and do not cause infections in healthy people who do not have cystic fibrosis. They are particularly hard to treat as they are resistant to many commonly‐used antibiotics. Currently doctors do not know which antibiotics are best at treating these infections; which combinations of antibiotics should be used; how long the antibiotics should be used for; or whether there are additional treatments that might also help. This is an update of a previously published review. Search date The evidence is current to: 29 May 2019. Study characteristics We did not find any trials in people with exacerbations of cystic fibrosis who were infected with  Burkholderia cepacia  complex bacteria, where they were given different treatments at random. Key results More research is needed to find out which treatments are best for improving lung function and survival and for reducing side effects and length of time spent in hospital for people infected with  Burkholderia cepacia  complex bacteria experiencing an exacerbation.","4","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Burkholderia cepacia complex; Anti‐Bacterial Agents [*therapeutic use]; Burkholderia Infections [*drug therapy, microbiology]; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Disease Progression; Humans","10.1002/14651858.CD009529.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009529.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

SCD can cause severe pain, significant end‐organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Silent cerebral infarcts are the commonest neurological complication in children and probably adults with SCD. Silent cerebral infarcts also affect academic performance, increase cognitive deficits and may lower intelligence quotient. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions to reduce or prevent silent cerebral infarcts in people with SCD. Search methods We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980), and ongoing trial databases; all searches current to 14 November 2019. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register: 07 October 2019. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing interventions to prevent silent cerebral infarcts in people with SCD. There were no restrictions by outcomes examined, language or publication status. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Main results We included five trials (660 children or adolescents) published between 1998 and 2016. Four of the five trials were terminated early. The vast majority of participants had the haemoglobin (Hb)SS form of SCD. One trial focused on preventing silent cerebral infarcts or stroke; three trials were for primary stroke prevention and one trial dealt with secondary stroke prevention. Three trials compared the use of regular long‐term red blood cell transfusions to standard care. Two of these trials included children with no previous long‐term transfusions: one in children with normal transcranial doppler (TCD) velocities; and one in children with abnormal TCD velocities. The third trial included children and adolescents on long‐term transfusion. Two trials compared the drug hydroxyurea and phlebotomy to long‐term transfusions and iron chelation therapy: one in primary prevention (children), and one in secondary prevention (children and adolescents). The quality of the evidence was moderate to very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to trials being at high risk of bias because they were unblinded; indirectness (available evidence was only for children with HbSS); and imprecise outcome estimates. Long‐term red blood cell transfusions versus standard care Children with no previous long‐term transfusions and higher risk of stroke (abnormal TCD velocities or previous history of silent cerebral infarcts) Long‐term red blood cell transfusions may reduce the incidence of silent cerebral infarcts in children with abnormal TCD velocities, risk ratio (RR) 0.11 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.86) (one trial, 124 participants, low‐quality evidence); but make little or no difference to the incidence of silent cerebral infarcts in children with previous silent cerebral infarcts on magnetic resonance imaging and normal or conditional TCDs, RR 0.70 (95% CI 0.23 to 2.13) (one trial, 196 participants, low‐quality evidence). No deaths were reported in either trial. Long‐term red blood cell transfusions may reduce the incidence of: acute chest syndrome, RR 0.24 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.49) (two trials, 326 participants, low‐quality evidence); and painful crisis, RR 0.63 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.95) (two trials, 326 participants, low‐quality evidence); and probably reduces the incidence of clinical stroke, RR 0.12 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.49) (two trials, 326 participants, moderate‐quality evidence). Long‐term red blood cell transfusions may improve quality of life in children with previous silent cerebral infarcts (difference estimate ‐0.54; 95% confidence interval ‐0.92 to ‐0.17; one trial; 166 participants), but may have no effect on cognitive function (least squares means: 1.7, 95% CI ‐1.1 to 4.4) (one trial, 166 participants, low‐quality evidence). Transfusions continued versus transfusions halted: children and adolescents with normalised TCD velocities (79 participants; one trial) Continuing red blood cell transfusions may reduce the incidence of silent cerebral infarcts, RR 0.29 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.97 (low‐quality evidence). We are very uncertain whether continuing red blood cell transfusions has any effect on all‐cause mortality, Peto odds ratio (OR) 8.00 (95% CI 0.16 to 404.12); or clinical stroke, RR 0.22 (95% CI 0.01 to 4.35) (very low‐quality evidence). The trial did not report: comparative numbers for SCD‐related adverse events; quality of life; or cognitive function. Hydroxyurea and phlebotomy versus transfusions and chelation Primary prevention, children (121 participants; one trial) We are very uncertain whether switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy has any effect on: silent cerebral infarcts (no infarcts); all‐cause mortality (no deaths); risk of stroke (no strokes); or SCD‐related complications, RR 1.52 (95% CI 0.58 to 4.02) (very low‐quality evidence). Secondary prevention, children and adolescents with a history of stroke (133 participants; one trial) We are very uncertain whether switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy has any effect on: silent cerebral infarcts, Peto OR 7.28 (95% CI 0.14 to 366.91); all‐cause mortality, Peto OR 1.02 (95%CI 0.06 to 16.41); or clinical stroke, RR 14.78 (95% CI 0.86 to 253.66) (very low‐quality evidence). Switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy may increase the risk of SCD‐related complications, RR 3.10 (95% CI 1.42 to 6.75) (low‐quality evidence). Neither trial reported on quality of life or cognitive function. Authors' conclusions We identified no trials for preventing silent cerebral infarcts in adults, or in children who do not have HbSS SCD. Long‐term red blood cell transfusions may reduce the incidence of silent cerebral infarcts in children with abnormal TCD velocities, but may have little or no effect on children with normal TCD velocities. In children who are at higher risk of stroke and have not had previous long‐term transfusions, long‐term red blood cell transfusions probably reduce the risk of stroke, and other SCD‐related complications (acute chest syndrome and painful crises). In children and adolescents at high risk of stroke whose TCD velocities have normalised, continuing red blood cell transfusions may reduce the risk of silent cerebral infarcts. No treatment duration threshold has been established for stopping transfusions. Switching to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy may increase the risk of silent cerebral infarcts and SCD‐related serious adverse events in secondary stroke prevention. All other evidence in this review is of very low‐quality. Plain language summary Interventions to prevent silent strokes in people with sickle cell disease Review question We wanted to determine if there were any safe and effective interventions that prevent silent strokes (also known as silent cerebral infarcts) in people with sickle cell disease (SCD). Background SCD is a serious inherited blood disorder where the red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body, develop abnormally. Normal red blood cells are flexible and disc‐shaped, but in sickle cell disease they can become rigid and crescent shaped. Sickled cells are not only less flexible than healthy red blood cells, they are also stickier. This can lead to the blockage of blood vessels, resulting in tissue and organ damage and episodes of severe pain. The abnormal blood cells are more fragile and break apart, which leads to fewer red blood cells, known as anaemia. Sickled red blood cells can block blood flow in vessels in the brain, leading to a silent stroke. Silent strokes are common, occurring in up to 39% of people with SCD by 18 years of age. Two tests have been used to identify children at higher risk of having a first stroke. Transcranial doppler ultrasonography (TCD) measures the speed of blood flowing through arteries in the brain. Children with a high blood flow have an increased risk of stroke. Whereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) takes images of the brain to see if there are any small areas of damage called silent strokes. Children with silent strokes have an increased risk of clinical stroke. Treatments that have been considered for preventing silent strokes include long‐term red blood cell transfusions, the drug hydroxyurea and stem cell transplantation. Search date The evidence is current to: 14 November 2019. Study characteristics We found five randomised controlled trials which enrolled a total of 660 participants. Three trials compared blood transfusions to no blood transfusions and two trials compared blood transfusion to hydroxyurea. Trials were published between 1998 and 2016 and included children and sometimes adolescents; the majority had one form of SCD (HbSS). No trials included stem cell transplantation. All trials received government funding. Key results In children with abnormal TCD velocities, red blood cell transfusions may decrease the risk of silent strokes, but have little or no effect in children with normal TCD velocities. In children at higher risk of stroke (abnormal TCD velocities or previous silent stroke), red blood cell transfusions probably reduce the risk of clinical stroke; may reduce the risk of acute chest syndrome and painful crisis; but we are very uncertain whether they have any effect on the risk of death. In children with normal TCD velocities and previous silent stroke, red blood cell transfusions may improve quality of life, but make little or no difference to IQ. In children and adolescents who have had at least 12 months of regular red blood cell transfusions to prevent a stroke, continuing red blood cell transfusions may reduce the risk of silent stroke, but we are very uncertain whether they have any effect on the risk of death or clinical stroke. For children on long‐term red blood cell transfusions with iron chelation (treatment to remove excess iron) who have not had a stroke, we are very uncertain whether switching to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy (withdrawing blood to reduce excess iron) has any effect on the risk of a silent stroke, clinical stroke, death, or SCD‐related complications. For children and adolescents on long‐term red blood cell transfusions and iron chelation who have had a clinical stroke, we are very uncertain whether switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy has any effect on the risk of silent stroke or death. Switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy may increase the risk of SCD‐related complications. Quality of the evidence In children at higher risk of stroke who have not had previous long‐term transfusions, there is moderate‐quality evidence that long‐term red blood cell transfusions reduce the risk of stroke. The quality of evidence was rated as low to very‐low for the rest of the outcomes including risk of silent cerebral infarcts due to trials being at high risk of bias and because there were a small number of trials and a small number of participants included in the trials.","4","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Erythrocyte Transfusion; *Phlebotomy [adverse effects]; Adolescent; Anemia, Sickle Cell [*complications, drug therapy]; Antisickling Agents [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Brain Infarction [etiology, *prevention & control]; Cause of Death; Child; Cognition [physiology]; Humans; Hydroxyurea [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Primary Prevention [methods]; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Secondary Prevention [methods]; Stroke [prevention & control]","10.1002/14651858.CD012389.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012389.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

The predominant symptom associated with sickle cell disease is pain resulting from the occlusion of small blood vessels by abnormally 'sickle‐shaped' red blood cells. There are other complications, including chronic organ damage and prolonged painful erection of the penis, known as priapism. Severity of sickle cell disease is variable, and treatment is usually symptomatic. Priapism affects up to half of all men with sickle cell disease, however, there is no consistency in treatment. We therefore need to know the best way of treating this complication in order to offer an effective interventional approach to all affected individuals. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the benefits and risks of different treatments for stuttering (repeated short episodes) and fulminant (lasting for six hours or more) priapism in sickle cell disease. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched trial registries. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 09 September 2019. Date of most recent search of trial registries and of Embase: 01 October 2019. Selection criteria All randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing non‐surgical or surgical treatment with placebo or no treatment, or with another intervention for stuttering or fulminant priapism. Data collection and analysis The authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the trials. Main results Three trials with 102 participants were identified and met the criteria for inclusion in this review. These trials compared stilboestrol to placebo, sildenafil to placebo and a four‐arm trial which compared ephedrine or etilefrine to placebo and ranged in duration from two weeks to six months. All of the trials were conducted in an outpatient setting in Jamaica, Nigeria and the UK. None of the trials measured our first primary outcome, detumescence. However, all three trials reported on the reduction in frequency of stuttering priapism, our second primary outcome; and from the evidence included in this review, we are uncertain whether stilboestrol, etilefrine or ephedrine reduce the frequency of stuttering priapism as the certainty of the evidence has been assessed as very low. Additionally, we conclude that sildenafil may make little or no difference (low‐certainty evidence). Two trials reported on immediate side effects and we are uncertain whether etilefrine or ephedrine reduce the occurrence of these (very low‐certainty of evidence) and also conclude that sildenafil may make little or no difference in side effects (low‐quality evidence). Given that all of the trials were at risk of bias and all had low participant numbers, we considered the certainty of the evidence to be low to very low. Authors' conclusions There is a lack of evidence for the benefits or risks of the different treatments for both stuttering and fulminant priapism in sickle cell disease. This systematic review has clearly identified the need for well‐designed, adequately‐powered, multicentre randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of specific interventions for priapism in sickle cell disease. Plain language summary Treatments for long‐lasting and painful erection of the penis in boys and men with sickle cell disease Review question What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for stuttering (repeated short episodes) and fulminant (lasting for six hours or more) priapism in sickle cell disease? Background Priapism (the prolonged painful erection of the penis) is common in males with sickle cell disease. The length of time priapism lasts differs for different types and so does the medical treatment for it. Self‐management approaches may be helpful. We looked for randomised controlled trials of different treatments to find the best option. Search date We last looked for evidence on 09 September 2019. Study characteristics We found three trials set in Jamaica, Nigeria and the UK involving 102 people. Key results In the trials, four different drug treatments (stilboestrol, sildenafil, ephedrine and etilefrine) were compared to placebo. The trials all looked at whether the treatments reduced how often attacks of priapism occurred. There was no difference between any of the treatments compared to placebo. Due to lack of high‐quality evidence, we are not able to conclude the best treatment of priapism in sickle cell disease. More research is needed. This is an update of a previously published review.

"CD008037.PUB4","Hurley, MN; Smith, S; Forrester, DL; Smyth, AR","Antibiotic adjuvant therapy for pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2020","Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis is a multi‐system disease characterised by the production of thick secretions causing recurrent pulmonary infection, often with unusual bacteria. This leads to lung destruction and eventually death through respiratory failure. There are no antibiotics in development that exert a new mode of action and many of the current antibiotics are ineffective in eradicating the bacteria once chronic infection is established. Antibiotic adjuvants ‐ therapies that act by rendering the organism more susceptible to attack by antibiotics or the host immune system, by rendering it less virulent or killing it by other means, would be a significant therapeutic advance. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To determine if antibiotic adjuvants improve clinical and microbiological outcome of pulmonary infection in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register which is compiled from database searches, hand searches of appropriate journals and conference proceedings. Date of most recent search: 16 January 2020. We also searched MEDLINE (all years) on 14 February 2019 and ongoing trials registers on 06 April 2020. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised controlled trials of a therapy exerting an antibiotic adjuvant mechanism of action compared to placebo or no therapy for people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Two of the authors independently assessed and extracted data from identified trials. Main results We identified 42 trials of which eight (350 participants) that examined antibiotic adjuvant therapies are included. Two further trials are ongoing and five are awaiting classification. The included trials assessed β‐carotene (one trial, 24 participants), garlic (one trial, 34 participants), KB001‐A (a monoclonal antibody) (two trials, 196 participants), nitric oxide (two trials, 30 participants) and zinc supplementation (two trials, 66 participants). The zinc trials recruited children only, whereas the remaining trials recruited both adults and children. Three trials were located in Europe, one in Asia and four in the USA. Three of the interventions measured our primary outcome of pulmonary exacerbations (β‐carotene, mean difference (MD) ‐8.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐18.78 to 2.78); KB001‐A, risk ratio (RR) 0.25 (95% CI 0.03 to 2.40); zinc supplementation, RR 1.85 (95% CI 0.65 to 5.26). β‐carotene and KB001‐A may make little or no difference to the number of exacerbations experienced (low‐quality evidence); whereas, given the moderate‐quality evidence we found that zinc probably makes no difference to this outcome. Respiratory function was measured in all of the included trials. β‐carotene and nitric oxide may make little or no difference to forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) (low‐quality evidence), whilst garlic probably makes little or no difference to FEV 1  (moderate‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether zinc or KB001‐A improve FEV 1  as the certainty of this evidence is very low. Few adverse events were seen across all of the different interventions and the adverse events that were reported were mild or not treatment‐related (quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate). One of the trials (169 participants) comparing KB001‐A and placebo, reported on the time to the next course of antibiotics; results showed there is probably no difference between groups, HR 1.00 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.45) (moderate‐quality evidence). Quality of life was only reported in the two KB001‐A trials, which demonstrated that there may be little or no difference between KB001‐A and placebo (low‐quality evidence). Sputum microbiology was measured and reported for the trials of KB001‐A and nitric oxide (four trials). There was very low‐quality evidence of a numerical reduction in  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  density with KB001‐A, but it was not significant. The two trials looking at the effects of nitric oxide reported significant reductions in  Staphylococcus aureus  and near‐significant reductions in  Pseudomonas aeruginosa , but the quality of this evidence is again very low. Authors' conclusions We could not identify an antibiotic adjuvant therapy that we could recommend for treating of lung infection in people with cystic fibrosis. The emergence of increasingly resistant bacteria makes the reliance on antibiotics alone challenging for cystic fibrosis teams. There is a need to explore alternative strategies, such as the use of adjuvant therapies. Further research is required to provide future therapeutic options. Plain language summary Antibiotic enhancing treatment for lung infections in cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the use of agents to help antibiotics in treating lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis. Background People with cystic fibrosis suffer from infections in their lungs as they produce thick secretions which allow bacteria to grow in them. Often the infections are caused by unusual bacteria, including  Pseudomonas aeruginosa,  and these bacteria become resistant to treatment with antibiotics. Long‐term infection reduces a person's quality of life and their lung function. There are no new antibiotics currently being developed which use a new type of action. New agents ‐ antibiotic adjuvants ‐ are needed to work alongside antibiotics to make bacteria more sensitive to either antibiotics or to the body's own immune system, and to interfere with the formation of colonies of bacteria in the lungs. Search date The evidence is current to: 16 January 2020. Trial characteristics The review includes eight trials with 350 people with cystic fibrosis aged between five and 54 years of age .  Trials compared different antibiotic adjuvants (beta‐carotene (one trial), garlic (one trial), a biological agent (two trials), nitric oxide (two trials) and zinc (two trials)) with placebo (a substance that contains no medication) and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly. The trials lasted from two days to one year. Key results None of the treatments led to a longer time until the next flare up of lung disease compared to the people who received placebo. For the other measures we looked at (lung function, side effects, quality of life or number of infections) there were also no differences between the people given the adjuvant and the people given the placebo. All of the trials measured side effects of the treatment but these were mostly mild and happened in both the people receiving the treatment and those that did not. None of the therapies for enhancing the actions of antibiotics which we found, showed a significant benefit for either lung function, rate of infection or quality of life. More randomised controlled trials are needed before we can recommend the routine use of any of these therapies. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence ranges from very low to moderate, but we judged it to be low overall. We made these judgements because of the small number of trials that looked at each of the different adjuvant treatments meaning we were unable to combine results. The quality was also affected by the small number of people who were included.","7","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adolescent; Adult; Anti-Bacterial Agents [*administration & dosage]; Antibodies, Monoclonal [therapeutic use]; Bacterial Infections [*drug therapy, microbiology]; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Disease Progression; Garlic; Humans; Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments [therapeutic use]; Lung Diseases [*drug therapy, microbiology]; Nitric Oxide [therapeutic use]; Pseudomonas Infections [drug therapy]; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Vitamins [therapeutic use]; Young Adult; Zinc [administration & dosage]; beta Carotene [therapeutic use]","10.1002/14651858.CD008037.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008037.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

The diet is initiated in the neonatal period to prevent learning disability; however, it is restrictive and can be difficult to follow. Whether the diet can be relaxed or discontinued during adolescence or should be continued for life remains a controversial issue, which we aim to address in this review. This is an updated version of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the effects of a low‐phenylalanine diet commenced early in life for people with phenylketonuria. To assess the possible effects of relaxation or termination of the diet on intelligence, neuropsychological outcomes and mortality, growth, nutritional status, eating behaviour and quality of life. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Most recent search of the Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register: 30 April 2020. Selection criteria All randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing a low‐phenylalanine diet to relaxation or termination of dietary restrictions in people with phenylketonuria. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and methodological quality, and subsequently extracted the data. Main results We included four studies in this review (251 participants), and found few significant differences between treatment and comparison groups for the outcomes of interest. Blood phenylalanine levels were significantly lower in participants with phenylketonuria following a low‐phenylalanine diet compared to those on a less restricted diet, mean difference (MD) at three months ‐698.67 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐869.44 to ‐527.89). Intelligence quotient was significantly higher in participants who continued the diet than in those who stopped the diet, MD after 12 months 5.00 (95% CI 0.40 to 9.60). However, these results came from a single study. Authors' conclusions The results of non‐randomised studies have concluded that a low‐phenylalanine diet is effective in reducing blood phenylalanine levels and improving intelligence quotient and neuropsychological outcomes. We were unable to find any randomised controlled studies that have assessed the effect of a low‐phenylalanine diet versus no diet from diagnosis. In view of evidence from non‐randomised studies, such a study would be unethical and it is recommended that low‐phenylalanine diet should be commenced at the time of diagnosis. There is uncertainty about the precise level of phenylalanine restriction and when, if ever, the diet should be relaxed. This should be addressed by randomised controlled studies; however, no new studies are expected in this area so we do not plan to update this review. Plain language summary Using diet to manage phenylketonuria Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effects of a low‐phenylalanine diet started early in life in people with phenylketonuria. We also aimed to assess the possible effects of relaxing or stopping the diet on intelligence, quality of life and other outcomes. This is an updated version of a previously published review. Background Phenylketonuria is an inherited disease treated with dietary restriction of the amino acid phenylalanine. The diet is started in newborns to prevent learning disability; however, it is restrictive and can be difficult to follow. Whether the diet can be relaxed or stopped during adolescence or should be continued for life remains a controversial issue, which we aim to address in this review. Search date The evidence is current to: 30 April 2020. Study characteristics The review included four studies with 251 people with phenylketonuria. One study looked at the effects of stopping a low‐phenylalanine diet at four years of age, a second study looked at the effect of returning to low‐phenylalanine diets in children who had previously relaxed their diet, a third study looked at the effect of increasing phenylalanine intake in children who had continued on a low‐phenylalanine diet since diagnosis and the fourth (a large, multicentre study) investigated the use of a strict low‐phenylalanine diet compared to a moderately strict low‐phenylalanine diet in newly diagnosed children. Key results Given the differences between the studies, we were unable to combine many results across the four studies. We found few major differences between treatment and comparison groups for the outcomes of interest. Blood phenylalanine levels were significantly lower in participants with phenylketonuria following a low‐phenylalanine diet compared to those on a less restricted diet, mean difference (MD) at three months ‐698.67 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐869.44 to ‐527.89). Intelligence quotient was significantly higher in participants who continued the diet than in those who stopped the diet, MD after 12 months 5.00 (95% CI 0.40 to 9.60). However, these results came from a single study. More research is needed to show if it is safe to relax this diet later on; however, no new studies are expected in this area so we do not plan to update the review.

"CD008227.PUB4","Somaraju, URR; Solis-Moya, A","Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy for people with cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2020","Abstract - Background Most people with cystic fibrosis (CF) (80% to 90%) need pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) to prevent malnutrition. Enzyme preparations need to be taken whenever food is taken, and the dose needs to be adjusted according to the food consumed. A systematic review on the efficacy and safety of PERT is needed to guide clinical practice, as there is variability between centres with respect to assessment of pancreatic function, time of commencing treatment, dose and choice of supplements. This is an updated version of a published review. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of PERT in children and adults with CF and to compare the efficacy and safety of different formulations of PERT and their appropriateness in different age groups. Also, to compare the effects of PERT in CF according to different diagnostic subgroups (e.g. different ages at introduction of therapy and different categories of pancreatic function). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Most recent search: 07 November 2019. We also searched an ongoing trials website and the websites of the pharmaceutical companies who manufacture pancreatic enzyme replacements for any additional trials. Most recent search: 26 December 2019. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials in people of any age, with CF and receiving PERT, at any dosage and in any formulation, for a period of not less than four weeks, compared to placebo or other PERT preparations. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trials and extracted outcome data. They also assessed the risk of bias and quality of the evidence (GRADE) of the trials included in the review. Main results 14 trials were included in the review (641 children and adults with CF), two of these were parallel trials and 12 were cross‐over trials. Interventions included different enteric and non‐enteric‐coated preparations of varying formulations in comparison to each other. The number of participants in each trial varied between 14 and 129. 13 trials were for a duration of four weeks and one trial lasted seven weeks. The majority of the trials had an unclear risk of bias from the randomisation process as the details of this were not given; they also had a high risk of attrition bias and reporting bias. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. We mostly could not combine data from the trials as they compared different formulations and the findings from individual trials provided insufficient evidence to determine the size and precision of the effects of different formulations. Authors' conclusions There is limited evidence of benefit from enteric‐coated microspheres when compared to non‐enteric coated pancreatic enzyme preparations up to one month. In the only comparison where we could combine any data, the fact that these were cross‐over trials is likely to underestimate the level of inconsistency between the results of the trials due to over‐inflation of CIs from the individual trials.There is no evidence on the long‐term effectiveness and risks associated with PERT. There is also no evidence on the relative dosages of enzymes needed for people with different levels of severity of pancreatic insufficiency, optimum time to start treatment and variations based on differences in meals and meal sizes .  There is a need for a properly designed trial that can answer these questions. Plain language summary Pancreatic enzyme supplements for people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about how good pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) is in overcoming the enzyme deficiency in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) and if there are any side effects. Background Between 80% and 90% of people with CF take PERT because their pancreas can not make the enzymes needed to digest food. As a result, children may fail to gain weight and thrive; while adults may lose weight and become malnourished as they do not absorb vitamins properly. In people with CF, malnutrition is linked to poorer general health, more severe lung disease and shorter life expectancy. If their pancreas is not making enough enzymes, people with CF can also experience painful, frequent, bulky, offensive bowel movements. PERT is needed to help gain weight, prevent malnutrition and avoid some vitamin deficiencies, as well as to control bowel symptoms. This is an updated version of the review. Search date We last searched for evidence: 26 December 2019. Study characteristics We assessed 14 trials (641 adults and children with CF); 13 trials gave treatment for four weeks and one for seven weeks. Trials compared different formulations of PERT, some were treated to delay the release of the medication until they passed from the stomach into the intestine, while others were not. In 12 trials participants took both types of supplement for four weeks each, although the order in which they took them was random. These factors made it difficult to analyse trial results. Most of the trials were old; the most recent was from 2017, but the oldest was from 1986. Key results We are uncertain whether any PERT formulation is better than another for improving any of our most important outcomes (weight, height or body mass index). In two trials (41 participants) those taking delayed‐release microspheres (miniature drug capsules) had less fat in their poo than those taking delayed‐release tablets (normal size); they also had less abdominal pain and did not need to go to the toilet as often. In a different trial (12 participants), those taking the delayed‐release microspheres also had less fat in their poo than those taking delayed‐release supplements. We also found that in a large trial (128 participants), people taking PERT not made from animal enzymes had less fat in their poo than those taking PERT made from pigs' enzymes. We found no difference between any of the different PERT formulations for any other bowel symptoms (e.g. abdominal pain, flatulence, constipation), quality of life, side effects or for any measure of lung disease. None of the trials reported the number of days in hospital or the incidence of vitamin deficiency. We did not find any evidence on different dose levels of PERT needed for people who produce different levels of pancreatic enzymes, on the best time to start treatment or for the amounts of supplements based on differences in type of food eaten and meal sizes .  A properly designed trial is needed to answer these questions. Quality of the evidence We found the quality of the evidence for the different outcomes to be moderate at best, but mostly very low. We are not sure that the participants had equal chances of being put into the different treatment groups as the trials gave no details about how the decisions were made. In several trials large numbers of participants dropped out and reasons for this were often not given. In most trials, people took one treatment for four weeks and then swapped to the alternative treatment. This design means that the results may appear more consistent than they really are when we analyse them. The only results we could combine were from two such trials. Finally, several trials did not completely report their findings in a way we could analyse in this review. We are not sure how these factors affect our confidence in the results we found.","8","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Abdominal Pain [epidemiology]; Adult; Age Factors; Capsules [administration & dosage]; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*therapy]; Delayed-Action Preparations; Enzyme Replacement Therapy [adverse effects, *standards]; Gastrointestinal Agents [therapeutic use]; Humans; Microspheres; Nutritional Status; Pancreas [enzymology]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Weight Gain","10.1002/14651858.CD008227.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008227.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

The severe form is characterized by a factor level less than 0.01 international units (IU) per milliliter. The development of inhibitors in hemophilia is the main complication of treatment, because the presence of these antibodies, reduces or even nullifies the efficacy of replacement therapy, making it very difficult to control the bleeding. People with inhibitors continue to have significantly higher risks of morbidity and mortality, with considerable treatment costs. Given the wide 'off‐label' use of rituximab for treating people with hemophilia and inhibitors, its efficacy and safety need to be evaluated. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of rituximab for treating inhibitors in people with inherited severe hemophilia A or B. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register, complied from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews and also searched for ongoing or unpublished studies. We also undertook further searches of other bibliographic databases and trial registries. Date of last search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register: 19 March 2020. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials investigating the efficacy and safety of rituximab for treating inhibitors in people with hemophilia. Data collection and analysis No randomized controlled trials matching the selection criteria were eligible for inclusion. Main results No randomized controlled trials on rituximab for treating inhibitors in people with hemophilia were identified. Authors' conclusions We were unable to identify any relevant trials on the efficacy and safety of rituximab for treating inhibitors in people with hemophilia. The research evidence available is from case reports and case series. Randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rituximab for this condition. However, prior to the publication of any possible future randomized controlled trials, meta‐analysis of case reports and case series may provide some evidence. Plain language summary Rituximab for treating inhibitors in people with inherited severe hemophilia Review question We reviewed the evidence available to see if rituximab is effective and safe when treating clotting factor inhibitors in people with severe hemophilia. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Background Hemophilia A and B are inherited conditions in which there is either reduced levels (or none at all) of factor VIII (hemophilia A) or factor IX (hemophilia B) in the blood. In severe forms there are undetectable levels of these factors (less than 0.01 international units (IU) per milliliter). People with hemophilia are at risk of bleeding events which can occur spontaneously or after trauma or invasive medical procedures. Therefore, they need to be treated with factor concentrates, either in reaction to these events or preventatively. Unfortunately, about 30% of people with severe hemophilia A and 1% to 6% of people with severe hemophilia B can develop antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII or factor IX, because the factors are not recognized by the immune system. The development of inhibitors is the main complication of hemophilia treatment, because their presence reduces or cancels out the beneficial effects of replacement therapy, making it very difficult to control bleeding. Moreover, when inhibitors are present, it is impossible to start preventative treatment with factor VIII or factor IX concentrates. Therefore, it is important to eliminate the inhibitors and allow treatment to proceed successfully. The 'off‐label' use (currently unapproved for treating people with hemophilia) of rituximab, has shown in some studies an effect on eliminating inhibitors in people with hemophilia. Therefore, we wanted to see whether using rituximab was better than the standard treatment or other therapies without rituximab, and whether it is safe, and could save these people from life‐threatening hemorrhage and huge financial expense. Search date The evidence is current to: 19 March 2020. Key results We did not find any randomized controlled trials assessing rituximab in people with severe hemophilia. Well‐designed controlled trials are needed to assess the benefits and risks of using rituximab in people with hemophilia. Until controlled trials are published, only limited and low‐level evidence, based on individual cases, can guide physicians in making clinical decisions.","8","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Antibodies; Factor IX [antagonists & inhibitors, *immunology]; Factor VIII [antagonists & inhibitors, *immunology]; Hemophilia A [blood, *drug therapy]; Hemophilia B [blood, *drug therapy]; Humans; Immunologic Factors [*therapeutic use]; Rituximab [*therapeutic use]","10.1002/14651858.CD010810.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010810.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD009528.PUB5","Smith, S; Waters, V; Jahnke, N; Ratjen, F","Standard versus biofilm antimicrobial susceptibility testing to guide antibiotic therapy in cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2020","Abstract - Background Clinicians typically select the antibiotics used to treat pulmonary infections in people with cystic fibrosis based on the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing performed on bacteria traditionally grown in a planktonic mode (grown in a liquid). However, there is considerable evidence to suggest that  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  actually grows in a biofilm (or slime layer) in the airways of people with cystic fibrosis with chronic pulmonary infections. Therefore, choosing antibiotics based on biofilm rather than conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing could potentially improve response to treatment of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in people with cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives To compare biofilm antimicrobial susceptibility testing‐driven therapy to conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing‐driven therapy in the treatment of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  infection in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Most recent search: 07 April 2020. We also searched two ongoing trials registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Most recent searches: 07 April 2020 and 05 September 2017. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of antibiotic therapy based on biofilm antimicrobial susceptibility testing compared to antibiotic therapy based on conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the treatment of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  pulmonary infection in people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected RCTs, assessed their risk of bias and extracted data from eligible trials. Additionally, the review authors contacted the trial investigators to obtain further information. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE criteria. Main results The searches identified two multicentre, double‐blind RCTs eligible for inclusion in the review with a total of 78 participants (adults and children); one RCT was undertaken in people who were clinically stable, the second was in people experiencing pulmonary exacerbations. Both RCTs prospectively assessed whether the use of biofilm antimicrobial susceptibility testing improved microbiological and clinical outcomes in participants with cystic fibrosis who were infected with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa . The primary outcome was the change in sputum  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  density from the beginning to the end of antibiotic therapy. Although the intervention was shown to be safe, the data from these two RCTs did not provide evidence that biofilm susceptibility testing was superior to conventional susceptibility testing either in terms of microbiological or lung function outcomes. One of the trials also measured risk and time to subsequent exacerbation as well as quality of life measures and did not demonstrate any difference between groups in these outcomes. Both RCTs had an overall low risk of bias and the quality of the evidence using GRADE criteria was deemed to be moderate to high for the outcomes selected. Authors' conclusions The current evidence is insufficient to recommend choosing antibiotics based on biofilm antimicrobial susceptibility testing rather than conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the treatment of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  pulmonary infections in people with cystic fibrosis. Biofilm antimicrobial susceptibility testing may be more appropriate in the development of newer, more effective formulations of drugs which can then be tested in clinical trials. Plain language summary Standard versus biofilm antibiotic testing to guide antibiotic treatment in cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed evidence to see which testing method is better when deciding which antibiotics to use for treating a flare up of symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis; whether it is better to test antibiotics on  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  bacteria (bugs) when they are grown in a layer of slime (a biofilm) or when they are grown in liquid. We wanted to know if one of these methods would lead to better antibiotic choices with better clinical outcomes. Background Long‐term lung infection is the main cause of death in people with cystic fibrosis. Antibiotic treatments for these infections have helped people with cystic fibrosis live longer. Doctors usually choose which antibiotics to use after on testing them against bacteria grown from samples taken from the infected person. These bacteria are grown in a liquid in the laboratory; but in real life bacteria such as  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  do not grow in liquid in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis, instead they grow in a slime layer called a biofilm. Laboratory testing of antibiotics against  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  grown in a biofilm rather than in a liquid may give results that lead to better antibiotic choices with better clinical outcomes when treating lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis. Search date We last looked for evidence on 07 April 2020. Study characteristics We included two trials, one run in the USA (in people who were clinically stable) and one run in Canada (in people who were having an exacerbation or respiratory flare up). A total of 78 people from these trials gave sputum samples. Bacteria from these samples were grown in either a liquid (34 samples) or biofilm (44 samples) with an equal chance of being grown in either one. Neither the people taking part or their clinicians knew before or during the trial which method had been used for the sample from each person. A mixture of adults and children took part in the trials, with the average age being around 20 to 30 years. There were an equal number of men and women in both trials. Around half the people in the trials had two copies of the delta F508 gene and there were almost equal number of these in each group. Average lung function in both groups was similar. Key results The main outcome of both trials was the decrease in the amount of bacteria in the sputum of people in each group after antibiotic treatment. There was no difference in the levels of bacteria found in the sputum or in the improvement in lung function between the two groups in either trial. In both trials, there was a similar number of individuals in each group who had either a mild or moderate side effect. There were no serious side effects reported by anyone in either study. The evidence does not show that one method of testing is better than the other and that people receiving antibiotics chosen on the basis of either method have equal chances of any side effects. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence was quite good as people had equal chances of being in either group and they did not know which testing group they were in. This means we don't think the trial results would have been affected because of this.","6","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adolescent; Adult; Anti-Bacterial Agents [*therapeutic use]; Biofilms [*drug effects, growth & development]; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Female; Humans; Male; Microbial Sensitivity Tests [methods]; Pseudomonas Infections [complications, *drug therapy]; Pseudomonas aeruginosa [*drug effects, physiology]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Tract Infections [*drug therapy, microbiology]; Sputum [microbiology]","10.1002/14651858.CD009528.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009528.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Nontuberculous mycobacteria species (most commonly  Mycobacterium avium  complex and  Mycobacterium abscessus ) are isolated from the respiratory tract of approximately 5% to 40% of individuals with cystic fibrosis; they can cause lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis leading to more a rapid decline in lung function and even death in certain circumstances. Although there are guidelines for the antimicrobial treatment of nontuberculous mycobacteria lung disease, these recommendations are not specific for people with cystic fibrosis and it is not clear which antibiotic regimen may be the most effective in the treatment of these individuals. This is an update of a previous review. Objectives The objective of our review was to compare antibiotic treatment to no antibiotic treatment, or to compare different combinations of antibiotic treatment, for nontuberculous mycobacteria lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis. The primary objective was to assess the effect of treatment on lung function and pulmonary exacerbations and to quantify adverse events. The secondary objectives were to assess treatment effects on the amount of bacteria in the sputum, quality of life, mortality, nutritional parameters, hospitalizations and use of oral antibiotics. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and hand searching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of last search: 24 February 2020. We also searched a register of ongoing trials and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 21 March 2019. Selection criteria Any randomized controlled trials comparing nontuberculous mycobacteria antibiotics to no antibiotic treatment, as well as one nontuberculous mycobacteria antibiotic regimen compared to another nontuberculous mycobacteria antibiotic regimen, in individuals with cystic fibrosis.   Data collection and analysis Data were not collected because in the one trial identified by the search, data specific to individuals with cystic fibrosis could not be obtained from the pharmaceutical company. Main results One completed trial was identified by the searches, but data specific to individuals with cystic fibrosis could not be obtained from the pharmaceutical company. Authors' conclusions This review did not find any evidence for the effectiveness of different antimicrobial treatment for nontuberculous mycobacteria lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis. Until such evidence becomes available, it is reasonable for clinicians to follow published clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of nodular or bronchiectatic pulmonary disease due to  Mycobacterium avium  complex or  Mycobacterium abscessus  in patients with cystic fibrosis. Plain language summary Antibiotic treatment for nontuberculous mycobacteria in people with cystic fibrosis  Nontuberculous mycobacteria are bacteria that are in the same family as tuberculosis and are commonly found in the soil and water. These bacteria can be found in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis and can cause their lung function to worsen. Although there are guidelines on which antibiotics to use to treat lung infection due to these bacteria, these recommendations are not specific for people with cystic fibrosis. It is also not clear which are the most effective antibiotics. The main purpose of this review was to determine whether treatment with different antibiotic combinations for nontuberculous mycobacterial infection would improve lung function or decrease the frequency of chest infections in people with cystic fibrosis. We found one randomized controlled trial but it included both people with and without cystic fibrosis and we could not get the information specifically about individuals with cystic fibrosis so could not include the information in this review. Until the time when such information is available, clinicians should follow the current guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of lung infections due to nontuberculous mycobacteria in the general population. Review question We reviewed the evidence about using antibiotics to treat nontuberculous mycobacteria infection in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Nontuberculous mycobacteria are bacteria that are from the same family as tuberculosis and are commonly found in the soil and water. These bacteria can be found in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis and may cause their lung function to worsen. Although there are guidelines on which antibiotics to use to treat lung infection due to these bacteria, these recommendations are not specifically for people with cystic fibrosis.

Plain language summary Interventions for treating intrahepatic cholestasis in people with sickle cell disease Review question We aimed to review the evidence for treating intrahepatic cholestasis (liver diseases where bile is either not formed or excreted properly (or both)) in people with sickle cell disease. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Background Sickle cell disease is an inherited condition and the most common hemoglobinopathy occurring worldwide. In 2006, the WHO declared sickle cell disease as a major public health problem with an estimated 70% of sufferers living in Africa. It is common among people with sub‐Saharan African, Indian, Middle Eastern or Mediterranean ancestry. Sickle cell disease affects the hepatobiliary system (liver, gall bladder, bile ducts), with repeated reduced blood flow and the formation of bilirubin stones (a type of gallstone). This results from sickled cells blocking blood vessels and from a reduction in the lifespan of these cells. Sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis or sickle cell hepatopathy (abnormal or diseased liver) is one complication of the disease. When diagnosed, people with this condition may show an intense yellowing of skin and eyes due to an increasing level of serum bilirubin (jaundice), tiredness, generalized itching, increasing pain in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen due to gallstones, an enlarged liver and lower hemoglobin levels. Sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis, while uncommon, is a potentially fatal complication with a high death rate. There is no agreement in how to diagnose or treat this condition. We wanted to assess the benefits and harms of treatments for intrahepatic cholestasis in people with sickle cell disease. Search date The evidence is current to 25 November 2019. Study characteristics We were not able to find any eligible trials. Key results We were not able to find any eligible trials. Quality of the evidence There is no randomised controlled trial evidence of any intervention for treating intrahepatic cholestasis in people with sickle cell disease. Trials are needed to establish the best treatment for this condition.","6","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Anemia, Sickle Cell [*complications]; Cholestasis, Intrahepatic [etiology, *therapy]; Humans","10.1002/14651858.CD010985.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010985.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

This is a rare and potentially lethal condition that classically presents in the first week of life once milk feeds have commenced. Affected babies may present with any or all of the following: cataracts; fulminant liver failure; prolonged jaundice; or  Escherichia coli  sepsis. Once the diagnosis is suspected, feeds containing galactose must be stopped immediately and replaced with a soya‐based formula. The majority of babies will recover, however a number will not survive. There are long‐term complications of galactosaemia, despite treatment, including learning disabilities and female infertility. It has been postulated that galactosaemia could be detected on newborn screening and this would prevent the immediate severe liver dysfunction and sepsis. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To assess whether there is evidence that newborn screening for galactosaemia prevents or reduces mortality and morbidity and improves clinical outcomes in affected neonates and the quality of life in older children. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and conference abstract books. We also searched online trials registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of the most recent search of Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Group's Trials Register: 12 December 2019. Date of the most recent search of additional resources: 02 February 2020. Selection criteria Randomised controlled studies and controlled clinical studies, published or unpublished comparing the use of any newborn screening test to diagnose infants with galactosaemia and presenting a comparison between a screened population versus a non‐screened population. Data collection and analysis No studies of newborn screening for galactosaemia were found. Main results No studies were identified for inclusion in the review. Authors' conclusions We were unable to identify any eligible studies for inclusion in this review and hence it is not possible to draw any conclusions based on randomised controlled studies. However, we are aware of uncontrolled studies which support the efficacy of newborn screening for galactosaemia. There are a number of reviews and economic analyses of non‐trial literature suggesting that screening is appropriate. Plain language summary Screening newborn babies for galactosaemia Review question We reviewed the evidence for screening newborn babies for galactosaemia in order to prevent or reduce death and illness, to improve clinical outcomes in affected babies and to improve the quality of life in affected older children. Background Galactosaemia is an inherited disease that affects the body's ability to breakdown the milk sugar galactose. Newborn babies with galactosaemia can have a variety of symptoms in the first weeks of life including poor feeding, cataracts, jaundice, an enlarged liver with liver failure or severe infection. Without treatment, babies with galactosaemia are often very unwell and highly likely to die from liver failure. Unfortunately, despite treatment, long‐term complications for people with galactosaemia include learning difficulties and fertility problems (in females). Search date The evidence is current to: 02 February 2020. Study characteristics No studies were identified for inclusion in the review. Key results No suitable studies were found, but we are aware of some uncontrolled studies which suggest newborn screening for galactosaemia and early treatment can reduce death and illness. Future research is needed to provide robust evidence for or against screening.

"CD011855.PUB3","Jaiswal, N; Singh, M; Agarwal, A; Chauhan, A; Jaiswal, N","Palliative drug treatments for breathlessness in cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2020","Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis is a life‐limiting autosomal recessive genetic illness. A feeling of shortness of breath is common in cystic fibrosis, especially as the disease progresses. Reversing the underlying cause is the priority when treating breathlessness (dyspnoea), but when it is not feasible, palliation (easing) becomes the primary goal to improve an individual's quality of life. A range of drugs administered by various routes have been used, but no definite guidelines are available. A systematic review is needed to evaluate such treatments. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of drugs used to ease breathlessness in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of last search: 18 November 2019. We searched databases (clinicaltrials.gov, the ISRCTN registry, the Clinical Trials Registry India and WHO ICTRP) for ongoing trials. These searches were last run on 06 March 2020. Selection criteria We planned to include randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials in people with cystic fibrosis (diagnosed by a positive sweat chloride test or genetic testing) who have breathlessness. We considered studies comparing any drugs used for easing breathlessness to another drug administered by any route (inhaled (nebulised), intravenous, oral, subcutaneous, transmucosal (including buccal, sublingual and intra‐nasal) and transdermal). Data collection and analysis The authors assessed the search results according to the pre‐defined inclusion criteria. Main results The new searches in 2020 yielded two ongoing studies that were not relevant to the review question. Previous searches had found only one study (cross‐over in design), which did not fulfil the inclusion criteria as no data were available from the first treatment period alone. Authors' conclusions Due to the lack of available evidence, this review cannot provide any information for clinical practice. The authors call for specific research in this area after taking into account relevant ethical considerations. The research should focus on the efficacy and safety of the drugs with efficacy being measured in terms of improvement in quality of life, dyspnoea scores and hospital stay. Plain language summary Drug treatments to ease breathlessness in cystic fibrosis Review question What is the evidence that drug treatments for breathlessness (also known as dyspnoea) in people with cystic fibrosis are effective and safe? Background Cystic fibrosis is a life‐limiting genetic disease. As the disease progresses, thick sticky mucus is formed in the lungs, pancreas and other organs. This thick mucus increases risk of infection, blocks the airways and causes severe breathlessness. Easing of this breathlessness is an important goal for care of people with cystic fibrosis. Many methods have been suggested to address this problem and many drugs have been reported to ease breathlessness. The drugs can be administered through various routes ‐ they might be inhaled, swallowed, injected under the skin, into muscle or into a vein or be absorbed through the skin (either on the body or through membranes inside the mouth or nose). Despite so many drugs being available, there are no defined guidelines for drug treatments aimed at easing breathlessness in people with cystic fibrosis. Search date The evidence from the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register is current to 18 November 2019; the searches of ongoing trial registries are current to 06 March 2020. Study characteristics We had planned to include studies comparing different treatments to ease breathlessness in people with cystic fibrosis where the participants were put into the different treatment groups at random. Our search found only one study in which seven people first received either a drug called hydrocodone or a placebo (dummy treatment) and then swapped to the other treatment; but this study did not report results separately for each treatment arm, so we are not able to include it in the review. Key results No studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, therefore it is not possible to comment on the outcomes we wished to report on in this review. Until evidence becomes available, the review authors feel that it is advisable for doctors to follow any local or national guidelines. The authors recommend research in this area should take ethical considerations into account and should focus on the safety of the drugs, improvement in quality of life, breathlessness scores and length of hospital stay.","4","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Dyspnea [*drug therapy]; Humans; Palliative Care [*methods]","10.1002/14651858.CD011855.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011855.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD006842.PUB5","Morrison, L; Milroy, S","Oscillating devices for airway clearance in people with cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2020","Abstract - Background Chest physiotherapy is widely prescribed to assist the clearance of airway secretions in people with cystic fibrosis. Oscillating devices generate intra‐ or extra‐thoracic oscillations orally or external to the chest wall. Internally they create variable resistances within the airways, generating controlled oscillating positive pressure which mobilises mucus. Extra‐thoracic oscillations are generated by forces outside the respiratory system, e.g. high frequency chest wall oscillation. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To identify whether oscillatory devices, oral or chest wall, are effective for mucociliary clearance and whether they are equivalent or superior to other forms of airway clearance in the successful management of secretions in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and hand searches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Latest search of the Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 29 July 2019. In addition we searched the trials databases ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Latest search of trials databases: 15 August 2019. Selection criteria Randomised controlled studies and controlled clinical studies of oscillating devices compared with any other form of physiotherapy in people with cystic fibrosis. Single‐treatment interventions (therapy technique used only once in the comparison) were excluded. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently applied the inclusion criteria to publications, assessed the quality of the included studies and assessed the evidence using GRADE. Main results The searches identified 82 studies (330 references); 39 studies (total of 1114 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Studies varied in duration from up to one week to one year; 20 of the studies were cross‐over in design. The studies also varied in type of intervention and the outcomes measured, data were not published in sufficient detail in most of these studies, so meta‐analysis was limited. Few studies were considered to have a low risk of bias in any domain. It is not possible to blind participants and clinicians to physiotherapy interventions, but 13 studies did blind the outcome assessors. The quality of the evidence across all comparisons ranged from low to very low. Forced expiratory volume in one second was the most frequently measured outcome and while many of the studies reported an improvement in those people using a vibrating device compared to before the study, there were few differences when comparing the different devices to each other or to other airway clearance techniques. One study identified an increase in frequency of exacerbations requiring antibiotics whilst using high frequency chest wall oscillation when compared to positive expiratory pressure (low‐quality evidence). There were some small but significant changes in secondary outcome variables such as sputum volume or weight, but not wholly in favour of oscillating devices and due to the low‐ or very low‐quality evidence, it is not clear whether these were due to the particular intervention. Participant satisfaction was reported in 13 studies but again with low‐ or very low‐quality evidence and not consistently in favour of an oscillating device, as some participants preferred breathing techniques or techniques used prior to the study interventions. The results for the remaining outcome measures were not examined or reported in sufficient detail to provide any high‐level evidence. Authors' conclusions There was no clear evidence that oscillation was a more or less effective intervention overall than other forms of physiotherapy; furthermore there was no evidence that one device is superior to another. The findings from one study showing an increase in frequency of exacerbations requiring antibiotics whilst using an oscillating device compared to positive expiratory pressure may have significant resource implications. More adequately‐powered long‐term randomised controlled trials are necessary and outcomes measured should include frequency of exacerbations, individual preference, adherence to therapy and general satisfaction with treatment. Increased adherence to therapy may then lead to improvements in other parameters, such as exercise tolerance and respiratory function. Additional evidence is needed to evaluate whether oscillating devices combined with other forms of airway clearance is efficacious in people with cystic fibrosis.There may also be a requirement to consider the cost implication of devices over other forms of equally advantageous airway clearance techniques. Using the GRADE method to assess the quality of the evidence, we judged this to be low or very low quality, which suggests that further research is very likely to have an impact on confidence in any estimate of effect generated by future interventions. Plain language summary The use of vibrating devices to help people with cystic fibrosis clear their airways of mucus Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of vibrating devices (e.g. Flutter, acapella, cornet, Quake ® , intrapulmonary percussive ventilation, high frequency chest wall oscillators (e.g. Vest ® ), VibraLung ®,  MetaNeb ® , and Aerobika ®  to help people with cystic fibrosis clear their airways of mucus. This is an update of a previously published review. Background People with cystic fibrosis have too much sticky mucus in their lungs which can lead to constant infection and inflammation. This damages their airways and worsens lung function over time. People with cystic fibrosis use chest physiotherapy to clear the mucus from their lungs. They can use different methods alone or in combination with others ‐ manual techniques, breathing techniques and mechanical devices. Vibrating devices (also sometimes known as oscillators) use pressure generated either inside or outside of the body to clear the mucus. Search date Evidence is current to 29 July 2019. Study characteristics The review included 39 studies with 1114 people with cystic fibrosis aged between 4 and 63 years of age .  Studies compared different physiotherapy treatments and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly. Not many studies looked at the same types of physiotherapy over the same period of time; studies ranged in duration from two days to 13 months. Key results Given the differences in study design, it was difficult to combine the results from these studies in a useful way. We did not find any clear evidence that vibrating devices were better than any other form of physiotherapy which they were compared to in these studies, or that one device was better than another. One study found that people using an vibrating device needed additional antibiotics for a chest infection more often than those using positive expiratory pressure. When recommending the most suitable method of airway clearance, physiotherapists should consider the needs of the people they are treating. For the future, larger and longer trials are needed to measure the frequency of lung infections, preference, adherence to and general satisfaction with treatment, financial constraints should also be taken into consideration. We think adherence is important, because if people with cystic fibrosis are willing to stick to their physiotherapy regimen, there may be improvements in other outcomes such as exercise tolerance, respiratory function and mortality. Quality of the evidence Overall, we thought most studies had some design problems which might affect our confidence in some of the results. In about a quarter of studies there were concerns that not all the results were reported clearly and in about a third of the studies the reasons for people withdrawing from a trial were not clearly explained. In comparisons of different types of physiotherapy, a person and their physiotherapist will always know which treatment they are receiving and this might affect their answers to some questions, such as which treatment makes them feel better, but we only thought this was a problem in a few studies. We used a scoring system called GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence, we then judged it to be either low‐ or very low‐quality, which suggests that further research is very likely to affect our confidence in the results in this review for of any of the interventions analysed.","4","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Mucociliary Clearance; Adolescent; Adult; Breathing Exercises; Chest Wall Oscillation [*instrumentation]; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications, physiopathology]; Disease Progression; Forced Expiratory Flow Rates; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Lung Diseases, Obstructive [etiology, *therapy]; Middle Aged; Mucus [*metabolism]; Patient Satisfaction; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Sputum [metabolism]; Vibration [*therapeutic use]","10.1002/14651858.CD006842.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006842.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Impaired pancreatic function may also result in increased gastric acidity, leading in turn to heartburn, peptic ulcers and the impairment of oral pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. The administration of gastric acid‐reducing agents has been used as an adjunct to pancreatic enzyme therapy to improve absorption of fat and gastro‐intestinal symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis. It is important to establish the evidence regarding potential benefits of drugs that reduce gastric acidity in people with cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the effect of drug therapies for reducing gastric acidity for: nutritional status; symptoms associated with increased gastric acidity; fat absorption; lung function; quality of life and survival; and to determine if any adverse effects are associated with their use. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic and non‐electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals,  abstract books and conference proceedings. Both authors double checked the reference lists of the searches Most recent search of the Group's Trials Register: 26 April 2021. On the 26 April 2021 further searches were conducted on the clinicaltrials.gov register to identify any ongoing trials that may be of relevance. The WHO ICTRP database was last searched in 2020 and is not currently available for searching due to the Covid‐19 pandemic. Selection criteria All randomised and quasi‐randomised trials involving agents that reduce gastric acidity compared to placebo or a comparator treatment. Data collection and analysis Both authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Main results The searches identified 40 trials; 17 of these, with 273 participants, were suitable for inclusion, but the number of trials assessing each of the different agents was small. Seven trials were limited to children and four trials enrolled only adults. Meta‐analysis was not performed, 14 trials were of a cross‐over design and we did not have the appropriate information to conduct comprehensive meta‐analyses. All the trials were run in single centres and duration ranged from five days to six months. The included trials were generally not reported adequately enough to allow judgements on risk of bias. However, one trial found that drug therapies that reduce gastric acidity improved gastro‐intestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain; seven trials reported significant improvement in measures of fat malabsorption; and two trials reported no significant improvement in nutritional status. Only one trial reported measures of respiratory function and one trial reported an adverse effect with prostaglandin E2 analogue misoprostol. No trials have been identified assessing the effectiveness of these agents in improving quality of life, the complications of increased gastric acidity, or survival. Authors' conclusions Trials have shown limited evidence that agents that reduce gastric acidity are associated with improvement in gastro‐intestinal symptoms and fat absorption. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to indicate whether there is an improvement in nutritional status, lung function, quality of life, or survival. Furthermore, due to the unclear risks of bias in the included trials, we are unable to make firm conclusions based on the evidence reported therein. We therefore recommend that large, multicentre, randomised controlled clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate these interventions. Plain language summary Drugs for reducing stomach acid for people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence for using drugs to reduce stomach acid in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Cystic fibrosis causes damage to the lungs and the pancreas. The pancreas produces enzymes which are needed for the body to digest and absorb food. If the pancreas is damaged this can affect how people can absorb food. It can also increase acidity in the stomach, which may lead to heartburn and peptic ulcers. There are drugs that can reduce the amount of acid in the stomach. Trials of these drugs have shown that they can improve problems in the stomach and digestive system and in the absorption of fat. This is an updated version of the review. Search date The evidence is current to: 26 April 2021. Study characteristics The review included at 17 trials with a total of 273 children and adults. Seven of the trials were limited to children and four trials enrolled only adults, while the remainder enrolled people of any age. All the trials were run in single centres and lasted from five days to six months. Most trials compared an intervention to placebo (a dummy treatment with no active medication). Six trials compared proton pump inhibitors (drugs which reduce the amount of acid made in the stomach, e.g. omeprazole and esomeprazole) to placebo and seven trials compared a H2 receptor antagonist (a second group of medicines that reduce the amount of acid made in the stomach, e.g. ranitidine and cimetidine) to placebo. One of the trials had three arms and compared a proton pump inhibitor to both a H2 receptor agonist and a placebo. In the remaining five trials, one compared pancrelipase (a combination of three enzymes (lipase, protease, and amylase) normally produced by the pancreas) to a combination of pancrelipase and misoprostol (a drug which protects the lining of the gut from stomach acid); one compared misoprostol to placebo and one trial compared enprostil (similar drug to misoprostol) to ranitidine. Two trials used sodium bicarbonate ‐ one compared to placebo and the second compared to calcium carbonate. Key results We were not able to combine the results from these trials due to their design. Individual trials reported some improvements in abdominal pain and fat absorption. However, the trials did not report improvements for other outcomes such as lung function, quality of life, or survival. The different drugs studied caused some adverse events; mainly diarrhoea (two people withdrew from one trial because of this) and bloating due to wind. As we could not combine the results from these trials, we were not able to reach firm conclusions about whether people with cystic fibrosis would benefit from taking these drugs. New long‐term trials are needed to examine the benefits and possible adverse effects for people with cystic fibrosis taking drugs to reduce stomach acid. Quality of the evidence There were 14 trials which had a cross‐over design (where people taking part are given first one treatment and then another treatment) and we did not have the appropriate information to analyse the results properly. Few of the included trials reported clearly on aspects of trial quality or gave enough information to allow us to judge whether any factors might cause a potential risk of bias to the results.","4","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Abdominal Pain [drug therapy]; Adult; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications, drug therapy]; Dietary Fats [pharmacokinetics]; Gastric Acid [*metabolism]; Gastrointestinal Agents [therapeutic use]; Histamine H2 Antagonists [*therapeutic use]; Humans; Intestinal Absorption [drug effects]; Pancreas [enzymology]; Proton Pump Inhibitors [*therapeutic use]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD003424.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003424.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD007923.PUB6","Dentice, R; Elkins, M","Timing of dornase alfa inhalation for cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2021","Abstract - Background Inhalation of the enzyme dornase alfa reduces sputum viscosity and improves clinical outcomes of people with cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives To determine whether the timing of dornase alfa inhalation (in relation to airway clearance techniques or morning versus evening inhalation) has an impact on objective and subjective measures of clinical efficacy in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods Relevant randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials were identified from the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), clinical trial registries and international cystic fibrosis conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 12 October 2020. Selection criteria Any trial of dornase alfa in people with cystic fibrosis where timing of inhalation was the randomised element in the trial with either: inhalation before compared to after airway clearance techniques; or morning compared to evening inhalation.  Data collection and analysis Both authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data with disagreements resolved by discussion. Relevant data were extracted and, where possible, meta‐analysed. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. Main results We identified 115 trial reports representing 55 trials, of which five trials (providing data on 122 participants) met our inclusion criteria. All five trials used a cross‐over design. Intervention periods ranged from two to eight weeks. Four trials (98 participants) compared dornase alfa inhalation before versus after airway clearance techniques. Inhalation after instead of before airway clearance did not significantly change forced expiratory volume at one second (very‐low quality evidence). Similarly, forced vital capacity (low‐quality evidence) and quality of life (very‐low quality evidence) were not significantly affected; forced expiratory flow at 25% was significantly worse with dornase alfa inhalation after airway clearance, mean difference ‐0.17 litres (95% confidence interval ‐0.28 to ‐0.05), based on the pooled data from two small trials in children (7 to 19 years) with well‐preserved lung function. All other secondary outcomes were statistically non‐significant. In one trial (25 participants), morning versus evening inhalation had no impact on lung function or symptoms (low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions The current evidence derived from a small number of participants does not indicate that inhalation of dornase alfa after airway clearance techniques is more or less effective than the traditional recommendation to inhale nebulised dornase alfa 30 minutes prior to airway clearance techniques, for most outcomes. For children with well‐preserved lung function, inhalation before airway clearance may be more beneficial for small airway function than inhalation after. However, this result relied on a measure with high variability and trials with variable follow‐up. In the absence of strong evidence to indicate that one timing regimen is better than another, the timing of dornase alfa inhalation can be largely based on pragmatic reasons or individual preference with respect to the time of airway clearance and time of day. Further research is warranted. Plain language summary The timing of inhalation of dornase alfa in people with cystic fibrosis Review question To determine the effect of timing of dornase alfa inhalation on measures of effectiveness in people with cystic fibrosis (in relation to airway clearance techniques or time of day). This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Background Inhaling the enzyme dornase alfa reduces the stickiness of sputum and improves clinical outcomes in people with cystic fibrosis. It is not certain whether it is better to inhale dornase alfa before or after clearing the airways with physical techniques. It is also not clear whether it is better to inhale it in the morning or in the evening. Search date The evidence is current to: 12 October 2020. Study characteristics We included five trials with a total of 122 participants. In these trials the length of treatment ranged from two to eight weeks. Key results Four of the trials compared inhaling before to inhaling after the airways had been cleared and found no overall difference in clinical outcomes. However, in children with well‐preserved lung function, inhaling of dornase alfa before airway clearance techniques was better for small airways function. However, this did not affect quality of life or other outcomes. In the remaining trial, morning versus evening inhalation had no impact on lung function or symptoms. Therefore, for many people with cystic fibrosis, the timing of dornase alfa inhalation (before or after airway clearance or the time of day) can be based on practical reasons or individual preference. Quality of the evidence Apart from one trial published only in abstract form, the quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low. This was due to issues relating to group allocation, blinding, incomplete reporting of outcome data and the the limited age range of participants.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Administration, Inhalation; Adolescent; Child; Combined Modality Therapy [methods]; Cystic Fibrosis [*therapy]; Deoxyribonuclease I [*administration & dosage]; Drug Administration Schedule; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Recombinant Proteins [administration & dosage]; Respiratory Therapy [*methods]; Time Factors; Vital Capacity; Young Adult","10.1002/14651858.CD007923.pub6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007923.pub6","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Injury to the spleen, among other factors, contribute to persons with SCD being particularly susceptible to infection. Infants and very young children are especially vulnerable. The 'Co‐operative Study of Sickle Cell Disease' observed an incidence rate for pneumococcal septicaemia of 10 per 100 person‐years in children under the age of three years. Vaccines, including customary pneumococcal vaccines, may be of limited use in this age group. Therefore, prophylactic penicillin regimens may be advisable for this population. This is an update of a Cochrane Review which was first published in 2002, and previously updated, most recently in 2017.  Objectives To compare the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis against pneumococcus in children with SCD receiving antibiotic prophylaxis compared to those without in relation to: 1. incidence of  Streptococcus pneumoniae  infection; 2. mortality (as reported in the included studies); 3. drug‐related adverse events (as reported in the included studies) to the individual and the community; 4. the impact of discontinuing at various ages on incidence of infection and mortality. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which is comprised of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and also two clinical trials registries: ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Registry Platform (not in 2020 given access issues relating to Covid‐19 pandemic). Additionally, we carried out hand searching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 25 January 2021. Selection criteria All randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing prophylactic antibiotics to prevent pneumococcal infection in children with SCD with placebo, no treatment or a comparator drug. Data collection and analysis The standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane were used. Both authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. The authors used the GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence. Main results Six trials were identified by the searches, of which three trials were eligible for inclusion. A total of 880 children, who were between three months to five years of age at randomization were included. The included studies were conducted in centres in the USA and in Kingston, Jamaica. In trials that investigated initiation of penicillin on risk of pneumococcal infection, the odds ratio was 0.37 (95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.86) (two trials, 457 children) (low‐certainty evidence), while for withdrawal the odds ratio was 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.09 to 2.71) (one trial, 400 children) (low‐certainty evidence). Adverse drug effects were rare and minor. Rates of pneumococcal infection were found to be relatively low in children over the age of five years. Overall, the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes was judged to be low. The results from the risk of bias assessment undertaken identified two domains in which the risk of bias was considered to be high, these were incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) (two trials) and allocation concealment (selection bias) (one trial). Domains considered to have a low risk of bias for all three trials were selective reporting (reporting bias) and blinding (performance and detection bias). Authors' conclusions The evidence examined was determined to be of low certainty and suggests that prophylactic penicillin significantly reduces risk of pneumococcal infection in children with homozygous SCD, and is associated with minimal adverse reactions. Further research may help to determine the ideal age to safely withdraw penicillin. Plain language summary Regular antibiotics for preventing pneumococcal infection in young children with sickle cell disease Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effects of prophylactic antibiotic regimens for preventing pneumococcal infection in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). This is an updated version of a previously published Cochrane Review. Background People living with SCD are especially prone to respiratory and blood infections. These infections are often caused by a germ (bacteria) known as  Streptococcus pneumoniae,  otherwise known as pneumococcus, which can cause many types of serious illnesses. Individuals with SCD can acquire infections more easily than unaffected persons because their spleen (an organ in the body that filters blood and is vital for the proper functioning of the immune system) does not work correctly, and also because damaged tissue and bone resulting from SCD can harbour bacteria. Infection prevention is therefore one of the major ways to improve the health of persons living with SCD and reduce the risk of death. The highest risk of infection occurs in children under three years of age, but the special vaccines that help to prevent illnesses with  S pneumoniae  are of limited use in this young population. Therefore, regular antibiotics in addition to these special vaccines are needed to prevent infection. As risk of infection decreases with age, there might be a time when preventative antibiotic treatment can be discontinued. The aim of the review was to determine the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis against pneumococcus in children with SCD. Search date The evidence is current to 25 January 2021. Study characteristics We gathered evidence for this Cochrane Review by examining three clinical trials with over 800 children included. Key results and quality of the evidence All three clinical trials showed a reduced rate of pneumococcal infection in children with SCD receiving penicillin preventatively. Two of these trials looked at whether treatment was effective. The third trial followed on from one of the early trials and looked at when it was safe to stop treatment. Adverse drug effects were rare and minor. However, there were problems with children keeping to the treatment schedule and with the development of antibiotic resistance. The quality of the evidence for both primary and secondary outcomes (end result) was judged to be low. We conclude that penicillin given to preventatively reduces the rate of pneumococcal infections in children with SCD under five years of age. The risk of infection in older children is lower, and the follow‐on trial did not show a significant increase in risk when regular penicillin was halted at five years old. Further research is needed to look at how commonly bacteria develop that are resistant to treatment and how clinically important this is.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Antibiotic Prophylaxis [adverse effects]; Age Factors; Anemia, Sickle Cell [*complications, genetics]; Bias; Child, Preschool; Hemoglobin SC Disease [complications]; Homozygote; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Medication Adherence; Penicillins [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Pneumococcal Infections [epidemiology, mortality, *prevention & control]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Streptococcus pneumoniae; beta-Thalassemia [complications]","10.1002/14651858.CD003427.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003427.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

It reduces mucus viscosity in the lungs, promoting improved clearance of secretions. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To determine whether the use of dornase alfa in cystic fibrosis is associated with improved mortality and morbidity compared to placebo or other medications that improve airway clearance, and to identify any adverse events associated with its use. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals and abstracts from conferences. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Register: 12 October 2020. Clinicaltrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were also searched to identify unpublished or ongoing trials. Date of most recent search: 08 February 2021. Selection criteria All randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing dornase alfa to placebo, standard therapy or other medications that improve airway clearance. Data collection and analysis Authors independently assessed trials against the inclusion criteria; two authors carried out analysis of methodological quality and data extraction. GRADE was used to assess the level of evidence. Main results The searches identified 74 trials, of which 19 (2565 participants) met our inclusion criteria. 15 trials compared dornase alfa to placebo or no dornase alfa (2447 participants); two compared daily dornase to hypertonic saline (32 participants); one compared daily dornase alfa to hypertonic saline and alternate day dornase alfa (48 participants); one compared dornase alfa to mannitol and the combination of both drugs (38 participants). Trial duration varied from six days to three years. Dornase alfa compared to placebo or no treatment Dornase alfa probably improved forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV 1 ) at one month (four trials, 248 participants), three months (one trial, 320 participants; moderate‐quality evidence), six months (one trial, 647 participants; high‐quality evidence) and two years (one trial, 410 participants). Limited low‐quality evidence showed treatment may make little or no difference  in quality of life. Dornase alfa probably reduced the number of pulmonary exacerbations in trials of up to two years (moderate‐quality evidence). One trial that examined the cost of care, including the cost of dornase alfa, found that the cost savings from dornase alfa offset 18% to 38% of the medication costs. Dornase alfa: daily versus alternate day One cross‐over trial (43 children) found little or no difference between treatment regimens for lung function, quality of life or pulmonary exacerbations (low‐quality evidence). Dornase alfa compared to other medications that improve airway clearance Results for these comparisons were mixed. One trial (43 children) showed dornase alfa may lead to a greater improvement in FEV 1  compared to hypertonic saline (low‐quality evidence), and one trial (23 participants) reported little or no differences in lung function between dornase alfa and mannitol or dornase alfa and dornase alfa plus mannitol (low‐quality evidence). One trial (23 participants) found dornase alfa may improve quality of life compared to dornase alfa plus mannitol (low‐quality evidence); other comparisons found little or no difference in this outcome (low‐quality evidence). No trials in any comparison reported any difference between groups in the number of pulmonary exacerbations (low‐quality evidence). When all comparisons are assessed, dornase alfa did not cause significantly more adverse effects than other treatments, except voice alteration and rash. Authors' conclusions There is evidence to show that, compared with placebo, therapy with dornase alfa may improve lung function in people with cystic fibrosis in trials lasting from one month to two years. There was a decrease in pulmonary exacerbations in trials of six months or longer, probably due to treatment. Voice alteration and rash appear to be the only adverse events reported with increased frequency in randomised controlled trials. There is not enough evidence to firmly conclude if dornase alfa is superior to other hyperosmolar agents in improving lung function. Plain language summary Dornase alfa, an inhaled drug, for treating lung disease in cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of using inhaled dornase alfa for treating lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Cystic fibrosis is an inherited condition which affects the movement of salt across cells in the body and affects, for example, the sweat glands, airways, pancreas and male reproductive system. Lung disease is the most common cause of death in people with cystic fibrosis and although the average life expectancy has increased over the last 30 years, it is still only 48.5 years in high‐income countries. People with cystic fibrosis develop chronic lung disease because of thick mucus that builds up in the lungs which causes infections and inflammation. Dornase alfa was developed to thin out this mucus, so it is easier for people to cough it up from their lungs; this in turn should decrease the number of infections and amount of inflammation and prevent chronic lung disease. Search date The evidence is current to: 12 October 2020. Study characteristics We included 19 trials with 2565 people with cystic fibrosis; 15 trials (2447 people) compared dornase alfa to placebo (a dummy treatment with no active medication) or no dornase alfa treatment; two trials (32 people) compared daily dornase to hypertonic saline; one trial (48 people) compared daily dornase alfa with hypertonic saline and alternate day dornase alfa; and one trial (38 people) compared dornase alfa to mannitol and the combination of both drugs. People from all age groups (infants through to adults) took part in the trials which lasted from six days to three years. Key results Dornase alfa compared to placebo or no treatment We found that dornase alfa probably improves lung function within one month when compared to a placebo or no treatment and this improvement was also seen in longer trials lasting from six months to two years (eight trials; 1708 participants). There were also fewer pulmonary exacerbations (flare up of lung inflammation) in these longer trials. One trial found that the cost savings from dornase alfa offset 18% to 38% of the medication costs. Dornase alfa ‐ daily versus alternate day One trial (43 children) found no differences between treatment schedules for lung function, quality of life or pulmonary exacerbations. Dornase alfa compared to other medications that improve airway clearance The results from trials comparing dornase alfa to hypertonic saline or mannitol were mixed. One trial (43 children) showed a greater improvement in lung function with dornase alfa compared to hypertonic saline and one trial (23 participants) reported no difference in lung function between dornase alfa and mannitol or dornase alfa and dornase alfa plus mannitol. In one trial (23 participants) quality of life scores were better with dornase alfa alone than with dornase alfa plus mannitol; other drug comparisons found no difference between treatments for quality of life. No trials in any comparison of treatments reported any difference between groups in the number of pulmonary exacerbations. Overall, no serious side effects were reported, with only rash and a change in voice seen more frequently in those people taking dornase alfa. However, it is not definitively clear from the current evidence if dornase alfa is better than other medications such as hypertonic saline or mannitol. Quality of the evidence The quality of evidence from the trials comparing dornase alfa to placebo or no treatment was moderate to high for lung function results, but only one trial reported any changes in quality of life so the evidence for this outcome is limited. Also, there were few trials comparing different treatment schedules of dornase alfa (e.g. once a day versus twice a day) or comparing dornase alfa to other medications which help with clearing secretions, so current evidence from these trials is limited and of low quality.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Cystic Fibrosis [*drug therapy]; Deoxyribonuclease I [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Disease Progression; Expectorants [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Infant; Mannitol [therapeutic use]; Placebos [therapeutic use]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Recombinant Proteins [adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Saline Solution, Hypertonic [therapeutic use]; Vital Capacity","10.1002/14651858.CD001127.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001127.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Vitamin E deficiency can cause a host of conditions such as haemolytic anaemia, cerebellar ataxia and cognitive difficulties. Vitamin E supplementation is widely recommended for people with cystic fibrosis and aims to ameliorate this deficiency. This is an updated version of the review. Objectives To determine the effects of any level of vitamin E supplementation on the frequency of vitamin E deficiency disorders in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register and also searched international online trial registries for any ongoing clinical trials that were not identified during our register search. Date of last search of the Register: 11 August 2020. Date of last search of international online trial registries: 20 July 2020. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing any preparation of vitamin E supplementation to placebo or no supplement, regardless of dosage or duration. Data collection and analysis Two authors extracted outcome data from each study (published information) and assessed the risk of bias of each included study. They assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. Main results Four studies with a total of 141 participants were included in the review, two of these were in children (aged six months to 14.5 years), and two did not specify participants’ age. All studies used different formulations and doses of vitamin E for various durations of treatment (10 days to six months). Two studies compared the supplementation of fat‐soluble as well as water‐soluble formulations to no supplementation in different arms of the same study. A third study compared a water‐soluble formulation to a placebo; and in the fourth study a fat‐soluble formulation of vitamin E was assessed against placebo. There was limited detail about randomisation and blinding in the included studies which compromises the quality of the evidence base for the review. The heterogeneous mix of the formulations with differing biovailabilities among these studies also limits the generalisability of the data to the wider cystic fibrosis population. None of the studies in either comparison report the review's primary outcomes of vitamin E total lipid ratio or the incidence of vitamin E‐specific deficiency disorders, or the secondary outcomes lung function or quality of life. Water‐soluble vitamin E Water‐soluble vitamin E may improve serum vitamin E levels compared with control at six months, one study (45 participants), mean difference (MD) 19.74 umol/L (95% confidence interval (CI) 13.48 to 26.00) (low‐quality evidence). Similar results were also seen at one month, two studies (32 participants), MD 17.66 umol/L (95% CI 10.59 to 24.74) and at three months, one study (45 participants), MD 11.61 umol/L (95% CI 4.77 to 18.45). Only one study (45 participants) reported weight (secondary outcome of growth and nutritional status) at one and six months, but showed no difference between treatment and control at either time point. Fat‐soluble vitamin E Two studies (36 participants) reported higher levels of serum vitamin E at one month with fat‐soluble vitamin E compared with control, MD 13.59 umol/L (95% CI 9.52 to 17.66); however, at three months one study (36 participants) showed no difference between treatment and control. No studies in this comparison reported on growth or nutritional status. Authors' conclusions Vitamin E supplementation may lead to an improvement in vitamin E levels in people with cystic fibrosis, although evidence we assessed was low quality. No data on other outcomes of interest were available to allow conclusions about any other benefits of this therapy. In future, larger studies are needed, especially in people already being treated with enteric‐coated pancreatic enzymes and supplemented with vitamin E, to look at more specific outcome measures such as vitamin E status, lung function and nutritional status. Future studies could also look at the optimal dose of vitamin E required to achieve maximal clinical effectiveness. Plain language summary Vitamin E supplementation in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We wanted to know what effects, if any, vitamin E supplementation (at any dose) has on how often people with cystic fibrosis have health problems due to vitamin E deficiency. Background Approximately 85% to 90% of people with cystic fibrosis do not produce enough enzymes in their pancreas and are not able to absorb fat when digesting food; they are also likely to have problems absorbing the fat‐soluble vitamins A, D, E and K. If levels of vitamin E are too low, this may cause blood disorders and problems with the nervous system, with memory and with thinking skills. Search date We last searched for evidence on 20 July 2020. Study characteristics We identified four studies including 141 participants; two of these were in children (aged six months to 14.5 years) and two did not specify the age of the participants. Those taking part in the studies received different forms of vitamin E supplements (either water‐soluble or fat‐soluble), placebo (a substance containing no medication) or no supplements. Three studies stated that the treatment for each person was chosen at random, but one study only said the people were split into different groups. Key results Water‐soluble vitamin E Evidence from one study (45 participants) showed that supplementation may increase vitamin E levels in the blood after six months. Similar results were seen at the earlier time points of one month (two studies, 32 participants) and three three months (one study, 45 participants). Only one study (45 participants) reported weight at one and six months, but showed no difference between supplementation and placebo at either time point. Fat‐soluble vitamin E Two studies (36 participants) reported higher levels of serum vitamin E after one month of fat‐soluble vitamin E supplements compared with no treatment, but a different study (36 participants) did not find any difference between supplementation and no treatment after three months. None of the studies in either comparison reported results for our planned outcomes of vitamin E total lipid ratio, the incidence of vitamin E‐specific deficiency disorders, lung function or quality of life. As the studies used different forms of supplements and different doses, it was difficult to combine the results and apply them to the wider cystic fibrosis population. The results showed that vitamin E supplementation may lead to an improvement in vitamin E levels in people with cystic fibrosis, but the quality of the evidence was low. Future studies should look at more specific outcomes such as vitamin E status, lung function and nutritional status, especially in people already receiving treatment with pancreatic enzymes and vitamin E supplements. They could also look at the best level of vitamin E supplements needed to be most clinically effective. Quality of the evidence We judged the evidence to be low quality for the following reasons. We do not think that any of the people taking part in the studies could tell whether they received the supplements or the placebo, so that would not have affected the results; although they would have known if they were taking supplements or not taking anything. We could not tell from the information we have whether most of the studies were designed so all people had an equal chance of being in any of the groups. We also could not tell if anyone would have been able to guess in advance which group they would be in. It was also not clear if there were results reported for everyone taking part in the studies and the reasons why anyone might have dropped out of the studies. We do not know if these facts will affect our confidence in the results.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Dietary Supplements; Adolescent; Adult; Bias; Child; Child, Preschool; Cystic Fibrosis [*blood]; Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency [complications]; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Placebos [administration & dosage]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Vitamin E Deficiency [prevention & control]; Vitamin E [*administration & dosage, blood, chemistry]; Vitamins [*administration & dosage, chemistry]; alpha-Tocopherol [administration & dosage]","10.1002/14651858.CD009422.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009422.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD004730.PUB5","Onady, GM; Stolfi, A","Drug treatments for managing cystic fibrosis‐related diabetes","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2020","Abstract - Background The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation recommends both short‐term and long‐acting insulin therapy when cystic fibrosis‐related diabetes (CFRD) has been diagnosed. Diagnosis is based on: an elevated fasting blood glucose level greater than 6.94 mmol/L (125 mg/dL); or oral glucose tolerance tests greater than 11.11 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) at two hours; or symptomatic diabetes for random glucose levels greater than 11.11 mmol/L (200 mg/dL); or glycated hemoglobin levels of at least 6.5%. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To establish the effectiveness of insulin and oral agents for managing diabetes in people with cystic fibrosis in relation to blood sugar levels, lung function and weight management. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also handsearched abstracts from pulmonary symposia and the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conferences. Date of most recent register search: 10 September 2020. We searched online trials registries; date of most recent searches: 21 March 2020. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials comparing all methods of pharmacological diabetes therapy in people with diagnosed CFRD. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. Authors also used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. Main results The searches identified 29 trials (45 references). Four included trials provide results: one short‐term single‐center cross‐over trial (seven adults) comparing insulin with oral repaglinide and no medication in adults with CFRD and normal fasting glucose; one long‐term multicenter trial (61 adults with CFRD) comparing insulin with oral repaglinide and placebo; one long‐term multicenter trial (67 adults) comparing insulin with oral repaglinide; and one 12‐week single‐center cross‐over trial (20 adults) comparing the long‐acting insulin glargine to short‐term neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin. Two ongoing trials of newly approved incretin mimics have been noted for possible future inclusion. Downgrading of the quality of the evidence was mainly due to risks of bias across all domains, but particularly due to concerns surrounding allocation concealment and selective reporting. There were also some concerns due to imprecision from small sample sizes and low event rates. Finally, there may be some bias due to the amounts of insulin and repaglinide given not being comparable. Data from one trial comparing insulin to placebo (39 participants) did not show any difference between groups for the primary outcomes of blood glucose levels (very low‐quality evidence), lung function (low‐quality evidence) or nutritional status (low‐quality evidence). Similarly, no differences between groups were seen for the secondary outcomes of number of hypoglycemic episodes (low‐quality evidence), secondary infection complications or quality of life (QoL). These results were mirrored in the narrative reports for the second trial in this comparison (seven participants). Data from the one‐year trial comparing repaglinide to placebo (38 participants), showed no differences between groups for the primary outcomes of blood glucose levels (very low‐quality evidence), lung function (low‐quality evidence) and nutritional status (low‐quality evidence). Also, no differences were seen between groups for the secondary outcomes of number of hypoglycemic episodes (low‐quality evidence), secondary infection complications or QoL. These findings were mirrored in the narrative reports for the second trial (n = 7) in this comparison. Three trials compared insulin to repaglinide (119 participants). Data from one trial (n = 67) showed no difference in blood glucose levels at either 12 months (high‐quality evidence) or 24 months; narrative reports from one trial (45 participants) reported no difference between groups, but the second trial (7 participants) reported a beneficial effect of insulin over repaglinide. Two trials (112 participants) found no difference between insulin and repaglinide in lung function or nutritional status (moderate‐quality evidence). Two trials (56 participants) reported no difference in the number of hypoglycemic episodes (low‐quality evidence). One trial (45 participants) reported no difference between groups in secondary infections and cystic fibrosis QoL. The single trial comparing glargine to neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin did not report directly on the review's primary outcomes, but did report no differences between groups in post‐prandial glucose values and weight; neither group reported infectious complications. There was no difference in episodes of hypoglycemia (very low‐quality evidence) and while there was no difference reported in QoL, all participants opted to continue treatment with glargine after the trial was completed. Mortality was not reported by any trial in any comparison, but death was not given as a reason for withdrawal in any trial. Authors' conclusions This review has not found any conclusive evidence that any agent has a distinct advantage over another in controlling hyperglycemia or the clinical outcomes associated with CFRD. Given the treatment burden already experienced by people with cystic fibrosis, oral therapy may be a viable treatment option. While some cystic fibrosis centers use oral medications to help control diabetes, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (USA) clinical practice guidelines support the use of insulin therapy and this remains the most widely‐used treatment method. Randomized controlled trials specifically related to controlling diabetes and its impact on the course of pulmonary disease process in cystic fibrosis continue to be a high priority. Specifically, investigators should evaluate adherence to different therapies and also whether there is benefit in using additional hypoglycemic agents as well as the newly approved incretin mimics. Agents that potentiate insulin action, especially agents with additional anti‐inflammatory potential should also be further investigated as adjuvant therapy to insulin. Plain language summary Drug treatments for managing cystic fibrosis‐related diabetes Review question We reviewed the evidence regarding different drugs for managing cystic fibrosis‐related diabetes (CFRD). Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common life‐limiting genetic condition, mainly causing damage to the lungs and pancreas. The pancreas makes insulin, a hormone which the body needs to take sugar into the cells so it can be converted into energy. In up to 90% of people with CF, problems with the pancreas and digestive enzymes mean nutrients are not properly absorbed. People with CF need high‐calorie and high‐protein diets to provide enough energy to maintain muscle mass so as to support their breathing and make up for breathing difficulties from disease‐damaged lungs. It is important for people with CF to turn sugar into energy efficiently. This is especially challenging for people with CFRD because damage to the pancreas affects insulin production and release. Inflammation seen in CF can reduce insulin production and lessen its effect by causing insulin resistance. Increased life expectancy for people with CF means that 50% of adults with CF are likely to develop CFRD. We wanted to assess different treatments for CFRD to limit any related decline in health. These include artificial sources of insulin (like long‐acting glargine or short‐acting protamine insulin), the control of natural hormones that stimulate insulin release and medications that enhance a person’s own insulin release or affect insulin resistance. Search date The evidence is current to: 10 September 2020. Study characteristics We included four trials (145 adults). Two trials compared insulin to either no treatment for two months (seven participants) or to a placebo (dummy drug with no active medication) for one year (61 participants). These trials, along with a third trial lasting two years (67 adults), also compared insulin (given via a syringe) to repaglinide tablets. The fourth trial (20 participants) compared the long‐acting insulin glargine to short‐term neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin over a 12‐week period. Key results We found results for our primary outcomes of blood glucose levels, lung function and nutritional status and our secondary outcomes of pulmonary exacerbations (flare up of disease), complications and quality of life. We could only analyse limited results and did not find evidence that showed that any one treatment was better than another. Our analysis did not show that either insulin or repaglinide made any difference to any of our outcomes compared to placebo or no treatment at any time point. Similarly, most of our results did not show whether insulin or repaglinide was better, but the evidence was a little stronger that there was no difference in lung function, nutritional status or blood glucose levels at 12 months. Similarly, the evidence was not strong enough to show if there is any difference between glargine and neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin for any of our outcome measures. None of the trials reported if there were any deaths. Given the treatment burden already experienced by people with CF, tablets may be a welcome alternative to injecting insulin. Longer‐term trials with larger numbers of people are still needed to see how controlling CFRD affects lung function. Investigators should also assess how many people keep to their treatment plan when comparing insulin to tablets. Research should look at using the drugs by themselves or together with insulin to enhance insulin action, especially those agents with additional anti‐inflammatory potential. Quality of the evidence We had some concerns about the quality of the evidence; mainly that there would be bias because clinicians probably knew in advance which treatment group the next person was going to be put into (e.g. healthier participants might be put into one group to show better results for that treatment) or bias from people taking part knowing which treatment group they were in (e.g. insulin via a syringe or repaglinide as a tablet). There may also be bias because results may only be selectively reported. We had some concerns that the analysis would not be precise due to small numbers of participants and low event rates. Finally, there may be bias in the results as the amounts of insulin and repaglinide given were not comparable.","10","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Administration, Oral; Bias; Blood Glucose [analysis]; Carbamates [administration & dosage]; Cystic Fibrosis [blood, *complications]; Diabetes Mellitus [blood, *drug therapy, etiology]; Fasting [blood]; Humans; Hyperglycemia [drug therapy]; Hypoglycemic Agents [*administration & dosage]; Insulin Glargine [administration & dosage]; Insulin [*administration & dosage]; Insulin, Isophane [administration & dosage]; Piperidines [administration & dosage]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD004730.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004730.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Selection criteria Randomised trials of continuous oral prophylactic antibiotics (given for at least one year) compared to intermittent antibiotics given 'as required', in people with cystic fibrosis of any disease severity. Data collection and analysis The authors assessed studies for eligibility and methodological quality and extracted data. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE criteria. The review's primary outcomes of interest were lung function by spirometry (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 )) and the number of people with one or more isolates of  Staphylococcus aureus  (sensitive strains). Main results We included four studies, with a total of 401 randomised participants aged zero to seven years on enrolment; one study is ongoing. The two older included studies generally had a higher risk of bias across all domains, but in particular due to a lack of blinding and incomplete outcome data, than the two more recent studies. We only regarded the most recent study as being generally free of bias, although even here we were not certain of the effect of the per protocol analysis on the study results. Evidence quality was judged to be low for all outcomes assessed after being downgraded based on GRADE assessments. Downgrading decisions were due to limitations in study design (all outcomes), for imprecision and for inconsistency . Prophylactic anti‐staphylococcal antibiotics probably make little or no difference to lung function measured as FEV 1  % predicted after six years (mean difference (MD) ‐2.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐13.59 to 8.99, one study, n = 119, low‐quality evidence); but may reduce the number of children having one or more isolates of  Staphylococcus aureus  at two years (odds ratio (OR) 0.21, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.35, three studies, n = 315, low‐quality evidence). At the same time point, there may be little or no effect on nutrition as reported using weight z score (MD 0.06, 95% CI ‐0.33 to 0.45, two studies, n = 140, low‐quality evidence), additional courses of antibiotics (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.60, one study, n = 119, low‐quality evidence) or adverse effects (low‐quality evidence). There was no difference in the number of isolates of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  between groups at two years (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.23, three studies, n = 312, low‐quality evidence), though there was a trend towards a lower cumulative isolation rate of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in the prophylaxis group at two and three years and towards a higher rate from four to six years. As the studies reviewed lasted six years or less, conclusions cannot be drawn about the long‐term effects of prophylaxis. Authors' conclusions Anti‐staphylococcal antibiotic prophylaxis may lead to fewer children having isolates of  Staphylococcus aureus , when commenced early in infancy and continued up to six years of age. The clinical importance of this finding is uncertain. Further research may establish whether the trend towards more children with CF with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa , after four to six years of prophylaxis, is a chance finding and whether choice of antibiotic or duration of treatment might influence this. Plain language summary Giving antibiotics regularly to people with cystic fibrosis to prevent lung infection with a germ called  Staphylococcus aureus Review question We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and adverse effects of giving regular antibiotics to people with cystic fibrosis to prevent lung infection with a germ called  Staphylococcus aureus . Background Cystic fibrosis blocks the airways with mucus and causes frequent airway infections. Over time, these can lead to lung damage and breathing failure. Most deaths in CF are caused by breathing failure. People with cystic fibrosis are sometimes given regular antibiotics to prevent infections from a germ called  Staphylococcus aureus . However, antibiotics can also have side effects such as oral thrush or diarrhoea and long term use might lead to other more serious kinds of infection. This is an update of a previously published review. Search date The evidence is current to: 27 February 2020. Study characteristics The review includes four studies with 401 children; there were no adult studies. The children were put into groups at random and received either an oral antibiotic continuously as a prevention for at least one year or no antibiotic treatment to prevent infection with  Staphylococcus aureus . All children could be given additional antibiotics if their doctor thought they needed them, based on symptoms and germs grown in their respiratory secretions. Studies lasted for a maximum of six years. Key results The review found some low‐quality evidence that giving regular antibiotics to young children (continued up to six years of age) may lead to fewer infections with  Staphylococcus aureus . For other outcomes in the review (weight, need for additional antibiotics, side effects or the number of infections with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa ) there was no difference between giving regular antibiotics or not. Since none of the studies lasted longer than six years, we can't draw any conclusions about long‐term use. Also, since all studies were in children, we can not comment on the use of these drugs in adults. Future research should seek more fully to address whether this treatment reduces, increases or has no effect on subsequent rates of infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  and look at patterns of antibiotic resistance and survival. A large ongoing study called CF‐START aims to address these uncertainties. Quality of the evidence Overall, the quality of the evidence was concerning. All the studies were of variable quality and we judged the quality of the evidence to be low for the outcomes we assessed. We judged that the two older studies had a higher risk of bias overall compared to the two newer studies. In particular this was because those taking part in the studies (or their parents or caregivers) would be able to guess which treatment they were receiving, and also one study did not state if anyone had dropped out and if so what the reasons were. Only the newest study seemed to be free of bias, although even here we were not certain if the study results were distorted by the way the data were analysed. Given these concerns, if results from future trials confirm the current findings, it would increase our certainty in our conclusions.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Antibiotic Prophylaxis; *Staphylococcus aureus [isolation & purification]; Bias; Child; Child, Preschool; Cystic Fibrosis [*microbiology]; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Forced Expiratory Volume; Growth; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Pseudomonas aeruginosa [isolation & purification]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Tract Infections [*prevention & control]; Staphylococcal Infections [*prevention & control]","10.1002/14651858.CD001912.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001912.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD001507.PUB4","Remmington, T; Smith, S","Tyrosine supplementation for phenylketonuria","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2021","Abstract - Background Phenylketonuria is an inherited disease for which the main treatment is the dietary restriction of the amino acid phenylalanine. The diet has to be initiated in the neonatal period to prevent or reduce mental handicap. However, the diet is very restrictive and unpalatable and can be difficult to follow. A deficiency of the amino acid tyrosine has been suggested as a cause of some of the neuropsychological problems exhibited in phenylketonuria. Therefore, this review aims to assess the efficacy of tyrosine supplementation for phenylketonuria. This is an update of previously published versions of this review. Objectives To assess the effects of tyrosine supplementation alongside or instead of a phenylalanine‐restricted diet for people with phenylketonuria, who commenced on diet at diagnosis and either continued on the diet or relaxed the diet later in life. To assess the evidence that tyrosine supplementation alongside, or instead of a phenylalanine‐restricted diet improves intelligence, neuropsychological performance, growth and nutritional status, mortality rate and quality of life. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register which is comprised of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Additional studies were identified from handsearches of the  Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease  (from inception in 1978 to 1998). The manufacturers of prescribable dietary products used in the treatment of phenylketonuria were also contacted for further references. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register: 07 December 2020. Selection criteria All randomised or quasi‐randomised trials investigating the use of tyrosine supplementation versus placebo in people with phenylketonuria in addition to, or instead of, a phenylalanine‐restricted diet. People treated for maternal phenylketonuria were excluded. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed the trial eligibility, methodological quality and extracted the data. Main results Six trials were found, of which three trials reporting the results of a total of 56 participants, were suitable for inclusion in the review. The blood tyrosine concentrations were significantly higher in the participants receiving tyrosine supplements than those in the placebo group, mean difference 23.46 (95% confidence interval 12.87 to 34.05). No significant differences were found between any of the other outcomes measured. The trials were assessed as having a low to moderate risk of bias across several domains. Authors' conclusions From the available evidence no recommendations can be made about whether tyrosine supplementation should be introduced into routine clinical practice. Further randomised controlled studies are required to provide more evidence. However, given this is not an active area of research, we have no plans to update this review in the future. Plain language summary Adding the amino acid tyrosine to the diet of people with phenylketonuria Review question We reviewed the evidence that in people with PKU (who commenced the diet at diagnosis and either continued on the diet or relaxed the diet later in life) tyrosine supplementation alongside, or instead of low phenylalanine diet, improves: intelligence; neuropsychological performance; growth and nutritional status; mortality rate; and quality of life. This is an update of previously published versions of this review. Background Phenylketonuria is an inherited disease. People with phenylketonuria can either not process phenylalanine from their diet at all or only in part. High blood levels of phenylalanine can cause brain or nerve damage. A diet avoiding foods high in phenylalanine can be hard to follow. People with phenylketonuria can have low levels of the amino acid tyrosine in their blood. Search date The evidence is current to: 07 December 2020. Study characteristics The review included three trials with 56 people with phenylketonuria aged between six and 28 years of age. Trials compared adding tyrosine or placebo (a substance which contains no medication) to a phenylalanine‐restricted diet and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly. The length of the treatment and control arms were short in all three trials and some of the outcomes considered important in this review were not measured. Key results Although the amount of tyrosine measured in the blood of those taking the supplement was higher, there were no differences noted in any other outcome measures. There is no evidence to suggest that tyrosine should be routinely added to the diet of people with phenylketonuria. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to provide more evidence. However, given this is not an active area of research, we have no plans to update this review in the future. Quality of the evidence The three trials considered in this review were of a good quality, but only included a small number of participants.","1","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Dietary Supplements; Humans; Intelligence [drug effects]; Neuropsychological Tests; Phenylalanine [blood]; Phenylketonurias [blood, diet therapy, *drug therapy]; Placebos [therapeutic use]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Tyrosine [blood, *therapeutic use]","10.1002/14651858.CD001507.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001507.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Many treatment options are available to the healthcare professional, although it is uncertain which treatments have been assessed for effectiveness in people with sickle cell disease. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives To assess the clinical effectiveness and harms of interventions for treating leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register. We searched LILACS (1982 to January 2020), ISI Web of Knowledge (1985 to January 2020), and the Clinical Trials Search Portal of the World Health Organization (January 2020). We checked the reference lists of all the trials identified. We also contacted those groups or individuals who may have completed relevant randomised trials in this area. Date of the last search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 13 January 2020; date of the last search of the Cochrane Wounds Group Trials Register: 17 February 2017. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of interventions for treating leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease compared to placebo or an alternative treatment. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion. All three authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. Main results Six studies met the inclusion criteria (198 participants with 250 ulcers). Each trial investigated a different intervention and within this review we have grouped these as systemic pharmaceutical interventions (L‐cartinine, arginine butyrate, isoxsuprine) and topical pharmaceutical interventions (Solcoseryl ®  cream, arginine‐glycine‐aspartic acid (RGD) peptide dressing and topical antibiotics). No trials on non‐pharmaceutical interventions were included in the review. All trials had an overall unclear or high risk of bias, and drug companies sponsored four of them. We were unable to pool findings due to the heterogeneity in outcome definitions, and inconsistency between the units of randomisation and analysis. Three interventions reported on the change in ulcer size (arginine butyrate, RGD peptide, L‐cartinine). Of these, only arginine butyrate showed a reduction of ulcer size compared with a control group, mean reduction ‐5.10 cm² (95% CI ‐9.65 to ‐0.55), but we are uncertain whether this reduces ulcer size compared to standard care alone as the certainty of the evidence has been assessed as very low. Three trials reported on complete leg ulcer closure (isoxsuprine, arginine butyrate, RGD peptide matrix; very low quality of evidence). None reported a clinical benefit. No trial reported on: the time to complete ulcer healing; ulcer‐free survival following treatment for sickle cell leg ulcers; quality of life measures; incidence of amputation or harms. Authors' conclusions Given the very low quality of the evidence identified in this updated Cochrane Review we are uncertain whether any of the assessed pharmaceutical interventions reduce ulcer size or result in leg ulcer closure in treated participants compared to controls. However, this intervention was assessed as having a high risk of bias due to inadequacies in the single trial report. Other included studies were also assessed as having an unclear or high risk of bias. The harm profile of the all interventions remains inconclusive. Plain language summary Treatments for leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease Review question We reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness and harms of interventions for treating leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Background Leg ulcers are a chronic complication for people living with sickle cell disease. Ulcers tend to be difficult to treat successfully, healing slowly over months or years. They can severely disrupt quality of life, increase disability, require extended absence from the workplace, and place a high burden of care on healthcare systems. We looked at whether treatments for leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease were effective and safe. Search date The evidence is current to: 13 January 2020. Study characteristics In this updated Cochrane Review we have included six randomised controlled trials including 198 participants with 250 ulcers. Four of the randomised controlled trials were conducted in Jamaica and two in the USA. These trials included medications or dressings applied directly to the ulcer (topical medications) and medications given orally or intravenously (systemic medications). Given the very different modes of action of these two groups, we treated them separately throughout the review. The topical agents included Solcoseryl® cream, RGD peptide matrix dressing and topical antibiotics. Socoseryl aims to improve the use of oxygen by the skin tissue and so promote wound healing. Topical antibiotics are also used to prevent infection. The RGD peptide matrix is a gel that promotes cell growth. The systemic interventions included arginine butyrate, L‐cartinine, and isoxsuprine. Aginine butyrate, given intravenously, is thought to accelerate wound healing, L‐carnitine, given orally, is thought to improve tissue hypoxia, and isoxsuprine, given orally as isoxsuprine hydrochloride, is thought to widen blood vessels, so increasing blood flow to an affected wound. Key results Given the very low quality of the evidence we are uncertain whether any of the assessed pharmaceutical interventions reduce ulcer size or result in leg ulcer closure. None of the included trials reported on our other outcomes of interest: the time to complete ulcer healing; ulcer‐free survival following treatment for sickle cell leg ulcers; quality of life measures; incidence of amputation; or harms. Quality of the evidence There is very limited evidence available on the use of interventions to treat people with sickle cell disease and chronic leg ulceration. All randomised clinical trials that we included in this review were associated with an unclear or high risk of bias, providing very low‐quality evidence. This systematic review has shown the need for well‐designed, high‐quality randomised trials to assess the benefits and harms of interventions to improve the healing of leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease.","1","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Anemia, Sickle Cell [complications, therapy]; *Leg Ulcer [etiology, therapy]; Bandages; Humans; Quality of Life; Wound Healing","10.1002/14651858.CD008394.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008394.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD010966.PUB3","Southern, KW; Murphy, J; Sinha, IP; Nevitt, SJ","Corrector therapies (with or without potentiators) for people with cystic fibrosis with class II CFTR gene variants (most commonly F508del)","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2020","Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common life‐shortening genetic condition caused by a variant in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. A class II  CFTR  variant F508del (found in up to 90% of people with CF (pwCF)) is the commonest CF‐causing variant. The faulty protein is degraded before reaching the cell membrane, where it needs to be to effect transepithelial salt transport. The F508del variant lacks meaningful CFTR function and corrective therapy could benefit many pwCF. Therapies in this review include single correctors and any combination of correctors and potentiators. Objectives To evaluate the effects of CFTR correctors (with or without potentiators) on clinically important benefits and harms in pwCF of any age with class II CFTR mutations (most commonly F508del). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, reference lists of relevant articles and online trials registries. Most recent search: 14 October 2020. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (parallel design) comparing CFTR correctors to control in pwCF with class II mutations. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias and evidence quality (GRADE); we contacted investigators for additional data. Main results We included 19 RCTs (2959 participants), lasting between 1 day and 24 weeks; an extension of two lumacaftor‐ivacaftor studies provided additional 96‐week safety data (1029 participants). We assessed eight monotherapy RCTs (344 participants) (4PBA, CPX, lumacaftor, cavosonstat and FDL169), six dual‐therapy RCTs (1840 participants) (lumacaftor‐ivacaftor or tezacaftor‐ivacaftor) and five triple‐therapy RCTs (775 participants) (elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor or VX‐659‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor); below we report only the data from elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor combination which proceeded to Phase 3 trials. In 14 RCTs participants had F508del/F508del genotypes, in three RCTs F508del/minimal function (MF) genotypes and in two RCTs both genotypes. Risk of bias judgements varied across different comparisons. Results from 11 RCTs may not be applicable to all pwCF due to age limits (e.g. adults only) or non‐standard design (converting from monotherapy to combination therapy). Monotherapy Investigators reported no deaths or clinically‐relevant improvements in quality of life (QoL). There was insufficient evidence to determine any important effects on lung function. No placebo‐controlled monotherapy RCT demonstrated differences in mild, moderate or severe adverse effects (AEs); the clinical relevance of these events is difficult to assess with their variety and small number of participants (all F508del/F508del). Dual therapy Investigators reported no deaths (moderate‐ to high‐quality evidence). QoL scores (respiratory domain) favoured both lumacaftor‐ivacaftor and tezacaftor‐ivacaftor therapy compared to placebo at all time points. At six months lumacaftor 600 mg or 400 mg (both once daily) plus ivacaftor improved Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire (CFQ) scores slightly compared with placebo (mean difference (MD) 2.62 points (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 4.59); 1061 participants; high‐quality evidence). A similar effect was observed for twice‐daily lumacaftor (200 mg) plus ivacaftor (250 mg), but with low‐quality evidence (MD 2.50 points (95% CI 0.10 to 5.10)). The mean increase in CFQ scores with twice‐daily tezacaftor (100 mg) and ivacaftor (150 mg) was approximately five points (95% CI 3.20 to 7.00; 504 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). At six months, the relative change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) % predicted improved with combination therapies compared to placebo by: 5.21% with once‐daily lumacaftor‐ivacaftor (95% CI 3.61% to 6.80%; 504 participants; high‐quality evidence); 2.40% with twice‐daily lumacaftor‐ivacaftor (95% CI 0.40% to 4.40%; 204 participants; low‐quality evidence); and 6.80% with tezacaftor‐ivacaftor (95% CI 5.30 to 8.30%; 520 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). More pwCF reported early transient breathlessness with lumacaftor‐ivacaftor, odds ratio 2.05 (99% CI 1.10 to 3.83; 739 participants; high‐quality evidence). Over 120 weeks (initial study period and follow‐up) systolic blood pressure rose by 5.1 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 4.1 mmHg with twice‐daily 400 mg lumacaftor‐ivacaftor (80 participants; high‐quality evidence). The tezacaftor‐ivacaftor RCTs did not report these adverse effects. Pulmonary exacerbation rates decreased in pwCF receiving additional therapies to ivacaftor compared to placebo: lumacaftor 600 mg hazard ratio (HR) 0.70 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.87; 739 participants); lumacaftor 400 mg, HR 0.61 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.76; 740 participants); and tezacaftor, HR 0.64 (95% CI, 0.46 to 0.89; 506 participants) (moderate‐quality evidence). Triple therapy Three RCTs of elexacaftor to tezacaftor‐ivacaftor in pwCF (aged 12 years and older with either one or two F508del variants) reported no deaths (high‐quality evidence). All other evidence was graded as moderate quality. In 403 participants with F508del/minimal function (MF) elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor improved QoL respiratory scores (MD 20.2 points (95% CI 16.2 to 24.2)) and absolute change in FEV 1  (MD 14.3% predicted (95% CI 12.7 to 15.8)) compared to placebo at 24 weeks. At four weeks in 107 F508del/F508del participants, elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor improved QoL respiratory scores (17.4 points (95% CI 11.9 to 22.9)) and absolute change in FEV 1  (MD 10.0% predicted (95% CI 7.5 to 12.5)) compared to tezacaftor‐ivacaftor. There was probably little or no difference in the number or severity of AEs between elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor and placebo or control (moderate‐quality evidence). In 403 F508del/F508del participants, there was a longer time to protocol‐defined pulmonary exacerbation with elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor over 24 weeks (moderate‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence that corrector monotherapy has clinically important effects in pwCF with F508del/F508del. Both dual therapies (lumacaftor‐ivacaftor, tezacaftor‐ivacaftor) result in similar improvements in QoL and respiratory function with lower pulmonary exacerbation rates. Lumacaftor‐ivacaftor was associated with an increase in early transient shortness of breath and longer‐term increases in blood pressure (not observed for tezacaftor‐ivacaftor). Tezacaftor‐ivacaftor has a better safety profile, although data are lacking in children under 12 years. In this population, lumacaftor‐ivacaftor had an important impact on respiratory function with no apparent immediate safety concerns; but this should be balanced against the blood pressure increase and shortness of breath seen in longer‐term adult data when considering lumacaftor‐ivacaftor. There is high‐quality evidence of clinical efficacy with probably little or no difference in AEs for triple (elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor) therapy in pwCF with one or two F508del variants aged 12 years or older. Further RCTs are required in children (under 12 years) and those with more severe respiratory function. Plain language summary CFTR correctors, a therapy for cystic fibrosis targeted at specific variants (most commonly F508del) Review question We looked at drugs (or drug combinations) for correcting the basic defect in the most common cystic fibrosis (CF)‐causing gene variant (F508del) and assessed their impact on outcomes important to people with CF (pwCF), e.g. survival, quality of life (QoL), lung function and safety. Background The CF gene makes a protein that helps salts move across cells in many parts of the body; over 80% of pwCF have at least one copy of F508del, meaning they make a full length of this protein, but it can not move through the cell correctly. Laboratory experiments suggest that if this protein reaches the cell wall, it may be able to function, restore salt movement and correct the chronic problems that pwCF experience. We examined several agents for correcting F508del. Our original review showed that while single drugs alone were not effective, they were when combined with other drugs. This updated review includes single, dual (corrector plus potentiator) and triple therapies (two different correctors plus one potentiator). Search date Evidence is current to: 14 October 2020. Study characteristics We included 19 studies (2959 pwCF (children and adults)) lasting between 1 day and 24 weeks (with an extension of two studies up to 96 weeks). Eight studies (344 participants) compared monotherapy: 4PBA, CPX, lumacaftor, cavosonstat and FDL169) to placebo (dummy treatment containing no active medicine), six studies (1840 participants) compared dual therapy (lumacaftor‐ivacaftor or tezacaftor‐ivacaftor) to placebo. Five studies (775 participants) assessed triple therapy (elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor or VX‐659‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor); only the combination with elexacaftor progressed beyond early studies. In 14 studies participants had two copies of F508del, in two studies participants had one F508del variant and one different variant, while in three studies participants had either two copies of F508del or one copy of F508del and one different variant. Key results Monotherapy versus control These studies did not report any deaths or clinically relevant improvements in QoL scores. There was insufficient evidence to show an effect on lung function. All studies reported side effects, but it is difficult to assess their relevance due to the range of effects and the small number of participants in the studies. Dual therapy versus control Neither the lumacaftor‐ivacaftor or tezacaftor‐ivacaftor studies in people with two copies of F508del reported any deaths and there were improvements in QoL and lung function. Pulmonary exacerbation (a flare‐up of symptoms) rates were also lower. Neither combination therapy was linked to severe side effects, although people starting treatment with lumacaftor‐ivacaftor experienced shortness of breath for one to two weeks, this usually stopped without further treatment .  More concerningly, in longer studies some people taking lumacaftor‐ivacaftor experienced a rise in blood pressure; two people (out of over 500) even stopped lumacaftor‐ivacaftor treatment because of high blood pressure. These side effects were not reported for tezacaftor‐ivacaftor. Tezacaftor‐ivacaftor therapy has not yet been assessed in children with CF under 12 years old. Triple therapy versus control. The three studies reported no deaths. Triple therapies improved QoL scores and lung function, with no difference in the number or severity of side effects; there was a longer time until the next pulmonary exacerbation. There is high‐quality evidence that elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor therapy is clinically effective with few side effects for pwCF with one or two F508del variants aged 12 years or older. Further RCTs are required in children (under 12 years) and those with more severe respiratory function. The side effect profile of elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor therapy seems to be similar to tezacaftor‐ivacaftor, but we need to collect information over the longer term. Quality of the evidence The overall quality of the evidence varied from low to high. There were generally few details about study design, so we could not make clear judgements on potential biases. We had fewer concerns with the larger more recent studies. In 10 studies, some results were not analysed or reported. Some findings were based on studies that were too small to show important effects and for nine studies the results may not be applicable to all pwCF due to the age (i.e. only adults or only children studied) or an unusual design (pwCF received monotherapy and then combination therapy).","12","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Mutation; Adult; Aminophenols [therapeutic use]; Aminopyridines [therapeutic use]; Benzodioxoles [therapeutic use]; Bias; Child; Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator [*drug effects, *genetics]; Cystic Fibrosis [*drug therapy, *genetics]; Drug Combinations; Humans; Indoles [therapeutic use]; Phenylbutyrates [therapeutic use]; Pyrazoles [therapeutic use]; Pyridines [therapeutic use]; Quality of Life; Quinolines [therapeutic use]; Quinolones [therapeutic use]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD010966.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010966.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Data collection and analysis Review authors independently selected articles for inclusion, evaluated the methodological quality of the studies, and extracted data. Additional information was sought from trial authors where necessary. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE system. Main results Authors identified 20 studies, of which 10 studies with 238 participants met the review's inclusion criteria. There was wide variation in the methodological and written quality of the included studies. Four of the 10 included studies were published as abstracts only and lacked concise details, thus limiting the information available. Eight studies were parallel studies and two of a cross‐over design. Respiratory muscle training interventions varied dramatically, with frequency, intensity and duration ranging from thrice weekly to twice daily, 20% to 80% of maximal effort, and 10 to 30 minutes, respectively. Participant numbers ranged from 11 to 39 participants in the included studies; five studies were in adults only, one in children only and four in a combination of children and adults. No differences between treatment and control were reported in the primary outcome of pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in one second and forced vital capacity) or postural stability (very low‐quality evidence). Although no change was reported in exercise capacity as assessed by the maximum rate of oxygen use and distance completed in a six minute walk test, a 10% improvement in exercise duration was found when working at 60% of maximal effort in one study (n = 20) (very low‐quality evidence). In a further study (n = 18), when working at 80% of maximal effort, health‐related quality of life improved in the mastery and emotion domains (very low‐quality evidence). With regards to the review's secondary outcomes, one study (n = 11) found a change in intramural pressure, functional residual capacity and maximal inspiratory pressure following training (very low‐quality evidence). Another study (n=36) reported improvements in maximal inspiratory pressure following training (P < 0.001) (very low‐quality evidence). A further study (n = 22) reported that respiratory muscle endurance was longer in the training group (P < 0.01). No studies reported significant differences on any other secondary outcomes. Meta‐analyses could not be performed due to a lack of consistency and insufficient detail in reported outcome measures. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to suggest whether this intervention is beneficial or not. Healthcare practitioners should consider the use of respiratory muscle training on a case‐by‐case basis. Further research of reputable methodological quality is needed to determine the effectiveness of respiratory muscle training in people with cystic fibrosis. Researchers should consider the following clinical outcomes in future studies; respiratory muscle function, pulmonary function, exercise capacity, hospital admissions, and health‐related quality of life. Sensory‐perceptual changes, such as respiratory effort sensation (e.g. rating of perceived breathlessness) and peripheral effort sensation (e.g. rating of perceived exertion) may also help to elucidate mechanisms underpinning the effectiveness of respiratory muscle training. Plain language summary Training the muscles that cause the chest to expand and contract in people with cystic fibrosis Review question What are the effects of training muscles to influence breathing (in and out) in people with cystic fibrosis? Background Cystic fibrosis is the most common genetic disease in white populations and causes problems with the lungs in most people with the condition. Training the muscles that cause the chest to expand and contract may help to improve lung function and the quality of life for people with cystic fibrosis. Search date The evidence is current to: 11 June 2020. Study characteristics We searched for studies where people with cystic fibrosis were put into either a group for respiratory muscle training or a control group at random. We included ten studies with 238 people which used a wide variety of training methods and levels. In eight of the studies, the treatment group and the control group each only received either respiratory muscle training or a control treatment (one study had three groups in total: one receiving control treatment and two receiving different levels of training). In one study the participants received both types of treatment, but in a random order. Lastly, one study compared training with usual care. The studies lasted for a maximum of 12 weeks and all were quite small; the largest only had 39 people taking part. The studies included people with a range of ages over six years old, but most seemed to be adults. The studies reported a variety of outcomes. All reported some measure of respiratory muscle strength, and most reported at least one measure of lung function, however only three studies reported on quality of life. Key results Results could not be combined to answer the review question, because the studies either did not publish enough details or did not use the same standard measurements. No study found any difference in lung function after training, but one of the studies reported an improvement in exercise duration when training at 60% of maximal effort and a further study which trained participants at 80% of maximal effort reported some improvements in quality of life judgements. There was some evidence of an improvement in respiratory muscle function in two studies. Given this lack of information, a recommendation for or against respiratory muscle training cannot be made. Future studies should look to improve upon the methods of those previously conducted, and should report using standardised measurements. Quality of the evidence It was generally unclear how people were split into groups for treatment and whether this would have affected the results. Three studies stated that the people assessing the outcomes did not know which treatment those taking part had received, but this was unclear in other studies. Individuals dropped out of three of the studies for reasons which may be directly related to the treatment and therefore may introduce a risk of bias to the results. One study had no‐one drop out and the other six studies did not state how many people dropped out of them. We assessed the quality of the evidence and judged the evidence for lung function, exercise capacity, postural stability and health‐related quality of life to be very low quality, but the evidence for respiratory muscle function to be low quality.","12","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adult; Breathing Exercises [*methods]; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*therapy]; Forced Expiratory Flow Rates; Humans; Inhalation [*physiology]; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Muscles [*physiology]; Vital Capacity","10.1002/14651858.CD006112.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006112.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

It is associated with complications and a reduced life expectancy. Phytomedicines (medicine derived from plants in their original state) encompass many of the plant remedies from traditional healers which the populations most affected would encounter. Laboratory research and limited clinical trials have suggested positive effects of phytomedicines both in vivo and in vitro. However, there has been little systematic appraisal of their benefits. This is an updated version of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives To assess the benefits and risks of phytomedicines in people with sickle cell disease of all types, of any age, in any setting. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register (ISRCTN), the Allied and Complimentary Medicine Database (AMED), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). Dates of most recent searches: Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 17 March 2020; ISRCTN: 19 April 2020; AMED: 18 May 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov: 24 April 2020; and the WHO ICTRP: 27 July 2017. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi‐randomised trials with participants of all ages with sickle cell disease, in all settings, comparing the administration of phytomedicines, by any mode to placebo or conventional treatment, including blood transfusion and hydroxyurea. Data collection and analysis Both authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Main results Three trials (212 participants) of three phytomedicines: Niprisan ®  (also known as Nicosan ® ), Ciklavit ®  and a powdered extract of  Pfaffia paniculata  were included. The Phase IIB (pivotal) trial suggests that Niprisan ®  may be effective in reducing episodes of severe painful sickle cell disease crisis over a six‐month period (low‐quality evidence). It did not appear to affect the risk of severe complications or the level of anaemia (low‐quality evidence). The single trial of  Cajanus cajan  (Ciklavit ® ) reported a possible benefit to individuals with painful crises, and a possible adverse effect (non‐significant) on the level of anaemia (low‐quality evidence). We are uncertain of the effect of  Pfaffia paniculata  on the laboratory parameters and symptoms of SCD (very low‐quality of evidence). No adverse effects were reported with Niprisan ®  and  Pfaffia paniculata  (low‐ to very low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions While Niprisan ®  appeared to be safe and effective in reducing severe painful crises over a six‐month follow‐up period, further trials are required to assess its role in managing people with SCD and the results of its multicentre trials are awaited. Currently, no conclusions can be made regarding the efficacy of Ciklavit ®  and the powdered root extract of  Pfaffia paniculata  in managing SCD. Based on the published results for Niprisan ®  and in view of the limitations in data collection and analysis of the three trials, phytomedicines may have a potential beneficial effect in reducing painful crises in SCD. This needs to be further validated in future trials. More trials with improved study design and data collection are required on the safety and efficacy of phytomedicines used in managing SCD. Plain language summary Phytomedicines (medicines derived from plants) for sickle cell disease Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect and safety of phytomedicines in people with sickle cell disease of all types, of any age, in any setting. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Background Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood condition caused by defects in the production of haemoglobin. Haemoglobin is the part of the red blood cell that carries oxygen across the body. Sickle cell disease occurs when people inherit faulty genes responsible for producing haemoglobin from both parents. A variety of complications and a reduced life expectancy are linked with sickle cell disease. Phytomedicines are medicines derived from plants in their original state. People with sickle cell disease may come across them in terms of plant‐remedies from traditional healers. Their benefits have not been evaluated systematically. Laboratory work has long suggested that these medicines may help to ease the symptoms of sickle cell disease. Search date The evidence is current to: 18 May 2020 . Study characteristics Three trials (212 participants) and three phytomedicines Niprisan ®  (also known as Nicosan ® ), Ciklavit ®  and the powdered root extract of  Pfaffia paniculata  were included. Key results This review found that Niprisan ®  may help to reduce episodes of sickle cell disease crises associated with severe pain. Ciklavit ®  may have little or no effect in reducing painful crises in SCD, and a possible adverse effect on the level of anaemia. We are uncertain of the effect of the powdered root extract of  Pfaffia Paniculata  in SCD. The three phytomedicine formulations reported no serious adverse symptoms or derangement of liver or kidney function in the participants. More scientifically robust trials of these medicines will need to be carried out before we can make any recommendations about their use. Further research should also assess long‐term outcome measures. Quality of the evidence We judged the quality of the evidence from this review to be of low to very low quality, depending on the outcome measured.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Phytotherapy [adverse effects]; Adolescent; Adult; Amaranthaceae [chemistry]; Anemia [chemically induced]; Anemia, Sickle Cell [blood, *drug therapy]; Antisickling Agents [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Cajanus; Child; Child, Preschool; Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Plant Extracts [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Plant Roots [chemistry]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD004448.pub7","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004448.pub7","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Commercially‐available extract supplements are marketed for preventing or treating various chronic conditions associated with oxidative stress. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of pine bark extract supplements for treating chronic disorders. Search methods We searched three databases and three trial registries; latest search: 30 September 2019. We contacted the manufacturers of pine bark extracts to identify additional studies and hand‐searched bibliographies of included studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating pine bark extract supplements in adults or children with any chronic disorder. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Where possible, we pooled data in meta‐analyses. We used GRADE to evaluate the certainty of evidence. Primary outcomes were participant‐ and investigator‐reported clinical outcomes directly related to each disorder and all‐cause mortality. We also assessed adverse events and biomarkers of oxidative stress. Main results This review included 27 RCTs (22 parallel and five cross‐over designs; 1641 participants) evaluating pine bark extract supplements across 10 chronic disorders: asthma (two studies; 86 participants); attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (one study; 61 participants), cardiovascular disease (CVD) and risk factors (seven studies; 338 participants), chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) (two studies; 60 participants), diabetes mellitus (DM) (six studies; 339 participants), erectile dysfunction (three studies; 277 participants), female sexual dysfunction (one study; 83 participants), osteoarthritis (three studies; 293 participants), osteopenia (one study; 44 participants) and traumatic brain injury (one study; 60 participants). Two studies exclusively recruited children; the remainder recruited adults. Trials lasted between four weeks and six months. Placebo was the control in 24 studies. Overall risk of bias was low for four, high for one and unclear for 22 studies. In adults with asthma, we do not know whether pine bark extract increases change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) % predicted/forced vital capacity (FVC) (mean difference (MD) 7.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.19 to 12.21; one study; 44 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), increases change in FEV 1  % predicted (MD 7.00, 95% CI 0.10 to 13.90; one study; 44 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), improves asthma symptoms (risk ratio (RR) 1.85, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.58; one study; 60 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) or increases the number of people able to stop using albuterol inhalers (RR 6.00, 95% CI 1.97 to 18.25; one study; 60 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). In children with ADHD, we do not know whether pine bark extract decreases inattention and hyperactivity assessed by parent‐ and teacher‐rating scales (narrative synthesis; one study; 57 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) or increases the change in visual‐motoric coordination and concentration (MD 3.37, 95% CI 2.41 to 4.33; one study; 57 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). In participants with CVD, we do not know whether pine bark extract decreases diastolic blood pressure (MD ‐3.00 mm Hg, 95% CI ‐4.51 to ‐1.49; one study; 61 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); increases HDL cholesterol (MD 0.05 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐0.01 to 0.11; one study; 61 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) or decreases LDL cholesterol (MD ‐0.03 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐0.05 to 0.00; one study; 61 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). In participants with CVI, we do not know whether pine bark extract decreases pain scores (MD ‐0.59, 95% CI ‐1.02 to ‐0.16; one study; 40 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), increases the disappearance of pain (RR 25.0, 95% CI 1.58 to 395.48; one study; 40 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) or increases physician‐judged treatment efficacy (RR 4.75, 95% CI 1.97 to 11.48; 1 study; 40 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). In type 2 DM, we do not know whether pine bark extract leads to a greater reduction in fasting blood glucose (MD 1.0 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.09; one study; 48 participants;very low‐certainty evidence) or decreases HbA1c (MD ‐0.90 %, 95% CI ‐1.78 to ‐0.02; 1 study; 48 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). In a mixed group of participants with type 1 and type 2 DM we do not know whether pine bark extract decreases HbA1c (MD ‐0.20 %, 95% CI ‐1.83 to 1.43; one study; 67 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). In men with erectile dysfunction, we do not know whether pine bark extract supplements increase International Index of Erectile Function‐5 scores (not pooled; two studies; 147 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). In women with sexual dysfunction, we do not know whether pine bark extract increases satisfaction as measured by the Female Sexual Function Index (MD 5.10, 95% CI 3.49 to 6.71; one study; 75 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) or leads to a greater reduction of pain scores (MD 4.30, 95% CI 2.69 to 5.91; one study; 75 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).

We do not know whether pine bark extract increases bone alkaline phosphatase in post‐menopausal women with osteopenia (MD 1.16 ug/L, 95% CI ‐2.37 to 4.69; one study; 40 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). In individuals with traumatic brain injury, we do not know whether pine bark extract decreases cognitive failure scores (MD ‐2.24, 95% CI ‐11.17 to 6.69; one study; 56 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) or post‐concussion symptoms (MD ‐0.76, 95% CI ‐5.39 to 3.87; one study; 56 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). For most comparisons, studies did not report outcomes of hospital admissions or serious adverse events. Authors' conclusions Small sample sizes, limited numbers of RCTs per condition, variation in outcome measures, and poor reporting of the included RCTs mean no definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy or safety of pine bark extract supplements are possible. Plain language summary Using pine bark supplements to help treat a variety of chronic diseases Review question Can pine bark antioxidant supplements help to treat chronic diseases? Background The main ingredients in pine bark extract supplements are proanthocyanidins, which are antioxidants. These supplements are marketed to prevent or treat a wide range of chronic diseases. This is an update of a previously published review, where we assessed how well these supplements work for treating chronic diseases, as well as their safety. Search date The evidence is current to 30 September 2019. Study characteristics We included 27 studies (1641 participants) across 10 chronic diseases. These included: asthma (two studies; 86 participants), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (one study; 61 participants), heart disease and risk factors (seven studies; 332 participants), chronic venous insufficiency (leg veins not working effectively; two studies; 60 participants), diabetes (six studies; 336 participants), erectile dysfunction (three studies; 227 participants), female sexual dysfunction (one study; 75 participants), osteoarthritis (cartilage damage in joints; three studies; 293 participants), osteopenia (beginning of bone mass loss; one study; 44 participants) and traumatic brain injury (one study; 56 participants). Two of the studies were conducted exclusively in children; the others were in adults. Studies compared pine bark supplements with placebo (i.e. a dummy supplement) or non‐antioxidant interventions and participants were randomly selected for one treatment or the other. The duration of treatment ranged from four weeks to six months. Key results For most outcomes across the different chronic diseases we only included one study with a small number of participants. In adults with asthma, we do not know whether pine bark extract increases lung function, improves asthma symptoms or increases the number of people able to stop using albuterol inhalers (a specific type of asthma pump). In children with ADHD, we do not know whether pine bark supplements decrease inattention and hyperactivity (assessed by parents and teachers) or whether it increases co‐ordination and concentration. In people with heart disease we do not know if pine bark supplements decrease blood pressure and LDL cholesterol (the bad type) or whether it increases HDL cholesterol (the good type). In adults with chronic venous insufficiency we do not know whether pine bark supplements decrease pain, increase the number of people free of pain, or how well doctors think the treatment works. In people with type 2 diabetes, we do not know whether pine bark supplements improve blood sugar levels or HbA1c levels (the long‐term marker for measuring blood sugar control); we also do not know if pine bark supplements decrease HbA1c in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. In men with erectile dysfunction, we do not know if pine bark supplements increase erectile function. Similarly, in women with sexual dysfunction, we do not know if pine bark supplements increase sexual satisfaction or reduce pain. In adults with osteoarthritis, it is not clear if pine bark supplements improve pain, swelling or stiffness in the knee, or whether it decreases the use of anti‐inflammatory drugs. We also do not know if pine bark supplements increase bone formation in postmenopausal women with weakened bones. Lastly, in people with a traumatic brain injury, it is not clear if pine bark supplements improve memory and post‐concussion symptoms . For most comparisons, studies did not report outcomes of hospital admissions or serious adverse events. With the available studies, we cannot clearly say how well (or not) pine bark supplements work and whether they are safe. Quality of the evidence The overall risk of bias was low for four studies, high for one and unclear for 22 studies. By this we mean the extent to which the methods used in a study enable it to determine the truth. The certainty of evidence was very low for all outcomes across all chronic diseases in the included studies.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adolescent; Adult; Antioxidants [*therapeutic use]; Asthma [drug therapy]; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity [drug therapy]; Bias; Bone Diseases, Metabolic [drug therapy]; Brain Injuries, Traumatic [drug therapy]; Cardiovascular Diseases [drug therapy]; Child; Chronic Disease [*drug therapy]; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1 [drug therapy]; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 [drug therapy]; Erectile Dysfunction [drug therapy]; Female; Flavonoids [*therapeutic use]; Humans; Hypertension [drug therapy]; Male; Middle Aged; Osteoarthritis [drug therapy]; Pinus; Plant Bark [*chemistry]; Plant Extracts [*therapeutic use]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Sexual Dysfunctions, Psychological [drug therapy]; Venous Insufficiency [drug therapy]","10.1002/14651858.CD008294.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008294.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

With increased catabolism and deficits in energy and nutrient intake, individuals with SCD suffer multiple macro‐ and micro‐nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin D deficiency. This is an update of a previous review. Objectives To investigate the effects of vitamin D supplementation in children and adults with SCD and to compare different dose regimens. To determine the effects of vitamin D supplementation on general health (e.g. growth status and health‐related quality of life), on musculoskeletal health (including bone mineral density, pain crises, bone fracture and muscle health), on respiratory health (including lung function, acute chest syndrome, acute exacerbation of asthma and respiratory infections) and the safety of vitamin D supplementation. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of last search: 19 March 2020. We also searched database such as PubMed, clinical trial registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 14 January 2020. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing oral administration of any form of vitamin D supplementation at any dose and for any duration to another type or dose of vitamin D or placebo or no supplementation in people with SCD, of all ages, gender, and phenotypes. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. They used the GRADE guidelines to assess the quality of the evidence. Main results Vitamin D versus placebo One double‐blind RCT (n = 39) compared oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) supplementation (20 participants) to placebo (19 participants) for six weeks. Only 25 participants completed the full six months of follow‐up. The study had a high risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data, but a low risk of bias for randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding (of participants, personnel and outcome assessors) and selective outcome reporting; and an unclear risk of other biases. Vitamin D supplementation probably led to higher serum 25(OH)D levels at eight weeks, mean difference (MD) 29.79 (95% confidence interval (CI) 26.63 to 32.95); at 16 weeks, MD 12.67 (95% CI 10.43 to 14.90); and at 24 weeks, MD 15.52 (95% CI 13.50 to 17.54) (moderate‐quality evidence). There was little or no difference in adverse events (tingling of lips or hands) between the vitamin D and placebo groups, risk ratio 3.16 (95% CI 0.14 to 72.84) (low‐quality evidence). Vitamin D supplementation probably caused fewer pain days compared to the placebo group at eight weeks, MD ‐10.00 (95% CI ‐16.47 to ‐3.53) (low‐quality evidence), but probably led to a lower (worse) health‐related quality of life score (change from baseline in physical functioning PedsQL scores); at both 16 weeks, MD ‐12.56 (95% CI ‐16.44 to ‐8.69) and 24 weeks, MD ‐12.59 (95% CI ‐17.43 to ‐7.76), although this may not be the case at eight weeks (low‐quality evidence). Vitamin D supplementation regimens compared Two double‐blind RCTs (83 participants) compared different regimens of vitamin D. One RCT (n = 62) compared oral vitamin D3 7000 IU/day to 4000 IU/day for 12 weeks, while the second RCT (n = 21) compared oral vitamin D3 100,000 IU/month to 12,000 IU/month for 24 months. Both RCTs had low risk of bias for blinding (of participants, personnel and outcome assessors) and incomplete outcome data, but the risk of selective outcome reporting bias was high. The bias from randomisation and allocation concealment was low in one study but not in the second. There was an unclear risk of other biases. When comparing oral vitamin D 100,000 IU/month to 12,000 IU/month, the higher dose may have resulted in higher serum 25(OH)D levels at one year, MD 16.40 (95% CI 12.59 to 20.21) and at two years, MD 18.96 (95% CI 15.20 to 22.72) (low‐quality evidence). There was little or no difference in adverse events between doses (low‐quality evidence). There were more episodes of acute chest syndrome in the high‐dose group, at one year, MD 0.27 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.52) but there was little or no difference at two years, MD 0.09 (95% CI ‐0.04 to 0.22) (moderate‐quality evidence). At one year and two years there was also little or no difference between the doses in the presence of pain (moderate‐quality evidence) or forced expiratory volume in one second % predicted. However, the high‐dose group had lower values for % predicted forced vital capacity at both one and two years, MD ‐7.20% predicted (95% CI ‐14.15 to ‐0.25) and MD ‐7.10% predicted (95% CI ‐14.03 to ‐0.17), respectively. There were little or no differences between dose regimens in the muscle health of either hand or the dominant hand. The study comparing oral vitamin D3 7000 IU/day to 4000 IU/day (21 participants) did not provide data for analysis, but median serum 25(OH)D levels were reported to be lower in the low‐dose group at both six and 12 weeks. At 12 weeks the median serum parathyroid hormone level was lower in the high‐dose group. Authors' conclusions We included three RCTs of varying quality. We consider that the current evidence presented in this review is not of sufficient quality to guide clinical practice. Until further evidence becomes available, clinicians should consider the relevant existing guidelines for vitamin D supplementation and dietary reference intakes for calcium and vitamin D. Well‐designed RCTs of parallel design, are required to determine the effects and the safety of vitamin D supplementation as well as to assess the relative benefits of different doses in children and adults with SCD. Plain language summary Vitamin D supplementation for sickle cell disease Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of giving vitamin D supplements to people with sickle cell disease (SCD). Background Vitamin D deficiency is common in people with SCD. Vitamin D regulates calcium levels and supports bone health and a lack of it make worse any bone health problems that people with SCD may have. We wanted to discover whether vitamin D supplements for people with SCD were better or worse than either a placebo (substance which contains no medication) or no vitamin D supplements and also if one dose schedule was better than another. Search date The evidence is current to: 14 January 2020. Study characteristics We looked at three studies where individuals were selected for different treatments at random. In one study, 39 people with SCD took either vitamin D or placebo tablets for six weeks and were then followed up for six months. In a second study, 62 people with SCD took either vitamin D 100,000 international units (IU)/month or 12,000 IU/month for two years. In the third study, 21 people with SCD took either 7000 IU/day or 4000 IU/day for three months. Key results Vitamin D versus placebo People taking a vitamin D supplement had higher levels of vitamin D in their blood when it was measured after eight, 16 and 24 weeks. There were no differences in the number of people reporting side effects (tingling in the lips or hands). The vitamin D group had fewer days of pain. After eight weeks, the vitamin D group had a slightly worse score for health‐related quality of life (physical functioning score); the difference was greater after 16 and 24 weeks. However, the quality of this evidence was low. Different vitamin D doses compared Only one of the two included studies which compared different doses of vitamin D supplementation provided any data for analysis. In the study with data, those taking a high‐dose of vitamin D (100,000 IU/month) had higher levels of vitamin D in their blood when it was measured after one and two years. There were no differences in the number of people reporting side effects, respiratory events, lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second) and hand grip strength. But forced vital capacity (another measure of lung function) was lower in high‐dose group. The study comparing oral vitamin D3 7000 IU/day to 4000 IU/day reported that people taking the low‐dose had lower average levels of vitamin D in the blood at both six and 12 weeks. At 12 weeks average levels of growth hormone were lower in the high‐dose group. Given the results from three small clinical trials with moderate to low‐quality evidence, we do not think the results of our review are of sufficient quality to guide clinical practice. Until further evidence is available, clinicians should consider relevant existing guidelines for vitamin D supplementation, and recommendations for calcium and vitamin D intake. Quality of the evidence Vitamin D versus placebo The risk of bias resulting from how people were put into the different groups was low. Also, neither those taking part or their doctor could guess which group they were in once the study started. Adverse events were not detailed in the original report, but the author provided the information when asked. More people dropped out of the placebo group (68.4%) than the vitamin D group (5%). The risk of bias from how the study reported results was high. We considered the evidence for vitamin D blood levels to be moderate quality, and for adverse events, days of pain and health‐related quality of life to be low quality. Different vitamin D doses compared The risk of bias resulting from how people were put into the different dose groups was low in one study and unclear in the second. Neither those taking part nor their doctor could guess which group they were in once both studies started. The risk of bias from people taking part dropping out was low, but the risk was high for how the study reported results. Tthe quality of the evidence for vitamin D blood levels and side effects was low, and for respiratory events it was moderate.","5","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Administration, Oral; Anemia, Sickle Cell [*blood, *complications]; Bias; Child; Cholecalciferol [*administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Humans; Pain [drug therapy]; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Time Factors; Vitamin D Deficiency [therapy]; Vitamin D [*administration & dosage, adverse effects, *analogs & derivatives, blood]","10.1002/14651858.CD010858.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010858.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

In those affected by the more severe forms, regular blood transfusions are required which may lead to iron overload. Accumulated iron from blood transfusions may be deposited in vital organs including the heart, liver and endocrine organs such as the pituitary glands which can affect growth hormone production. Growth hormone deficiency is one of the factors that can lead to short stature, a common complication in people with thalassaemia. Growth hormone replacement therapy has been used in children with thalassaemia who have short stature and growth hormone deficiency. This review on the role of growth hormone was originally published in September 2017 and updated in April 2020. Objectives To assess the benefits and safety of growth hormone therapy in people with thalassaemia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of latest search: 14 November 2019. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles, reviews and clinical trial registries. Date of latest search: 06 January 2020. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing the use of growth hormone therapy to placebo or standard care in people with thalassaemia of any type or severity. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion. Data extraction and assessment of risk of bias were also conducted independently by two authors. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE criteria. Main results We included one parallel trial conducted in Turkey. The trial recruited 20 children with homozygous beta thalassaemia who had short stature; 10 children received growth hormone therapy administered subcutaneously on a daily basis at a dose of 0.7 IU/kg per week and 10 children received standard care. The overall risk of bias in this trial was low except for the selection criteria and attrition bias which were unclear. The certainty of the evidence for all major outcomes was moderate, the main concern was imprecision of the estimates due to the small sample size leading to wide confidence intervals. Final height (cm) (the review's pre‐specified primary outcome) and change in height were not assessed in the included trial. The trial reported no clear difference between groups in height standard deviation (SD) score after one year, mean difference (MD) ‐0.09 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.33 to 0.15 (moderate‐certainty evidence). However, modest improvements appeared to be observed in the following key outcomes in children receiving growth hormone therapy compared to control (moderate‐certainty evidence): change between baseline and final visit in height SD score, MD 0.26 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.39); height velocity, MD 2.28 cm/year (95% CI 1.76 to 2.80); height velocity SD score, MD 3.31 (95% CI 2.43 to 4.19); and change in height velocity SD score between baseline and final visit, MD 3.41 (95% CI 2.45 to 4.37). No adverse effects of treatment were reported in either group; however, while there was no clear difference between groups in the oral glucose tolerance test at one year, fasting blood glucose was significantly higher in the growth hormone therapy group compared to control, although both results were still within the normal range, MD 6.67 mg/dL (95% CI 2.66 to 10.68). There were no data beyond the one‐year trial period. Authors' conclusions A small single trial contributed evidence of moderate certainty that the use of growth hormone for a year may improve height velocity of children with thalassaemia although height SD score in the treatment group was similar to the control group. There are no randomised controlled trials in adults or trials that address the use of growth hormone therapy over a longer period and assess its effect on final height and quality of life. The optimal dosage of growth hormone and the ideal time to start this therapy remain uncertain. Large well‐designed randomised controlled trials over a longer period with sufficient duration of follow up are needed. Plain language summary Growth hormone therapy for people with thalassaemia Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of treating people with thalassaemia with growth hormones. Background Thalassaemia is an inherited blood disorder that causes anaemia of varying severity. People who have the more severe forms of thalassaemia need regular blood transfusions from early childhood resulting in excess iron accumulating in vital organs such as the heart, liver and hormone‐secreting glands (endocrine glands). One of the glands at risk is the pituitary gland which secretes growth hormone which in turn regulates the growth and function of the human body. If the production of growth hormone is disrupted by iron deposition, the affected children may not grow very tall. Short stature is very common amongst people with thalassaemia. It may be caused by various factors including problems with growth hormone or other hormones, insufficient blood transfusions or poor nutrition. Synthetic growth hormone is one way of treating short stature in thalassaemia, especially in children with defective growth hormone production. This usually involves an injection of growth hormone under the skin (subcutaneously) several days a week over a period of time. However, it is unclear whether the use of synthetic growth hormone provides any consistent or clear benefits to people with thalassaemia. Search date In this update, we included evidence current to 14 November 2019. Study characteristics We found only one small trial for our review. It included 20 children with beta thalassaemia who were considerably shorter than they should be based on growth charts. Ten of the children were randomly selected to receive daily growth hormone treatment in addition to their usual (standard) treatment and the other 10 children just had their usual treatment. Investigators recorded the height of the children and did blood tests every three months. The trial was conducted over a one‐year period. Key results Height velocity is the rate at which a child grows taller and is calculated by measuring the difference in height over a period of time (usually measured as cm per year). In this review, the children who received growth hormone for one year had a higher height velocity (on average 2.28 cm per year more) compared to those who did not receive growth hormone. In other words, those given growth hormone grew modestly faster than those not on growth hormone. The height of a child may also be scored based on standard charts of the population (height standard deviation scores). Using this measurement, children treated with growth hormone had similar scores to those not on growth hormone at the end of one year. None of the 20 children suffered from any side effects. While there was no clear difference between groups in the oral glucose tolerance test at one year, those children on growth hormone therapy had higher fasting blood glucose levels, but these were still within the normal range. The trial did not provide information beyond the one‐year period, hence we do not know if the adult height of the children in the trial was affected by growth hormone therapy in any way. There were no trials in people with thalassaemia which examined the effects of growth hormone therapy over a longer period, at different dosages or in different age groups; neither were there any trials studying the effect of growth hormone therapy on adult height or general well‐being (quality of life). Certainty of the evidence Overall, we considered the certainty of evidence for the outcomes described above (short‐term growth and side effects) to be moderate, but we had a major concern that there was only a small number of participants. Conclusions Based on moderate‐certainty evidence from one small trial, the use of growth hormone may modestly improve some measures of growth. However, there was no information on final height or quality of life. More trials are needed before a clear conclusion can be drawn on the overall benefits and risks of using growth hormone in people with thalassaemia.","5","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adolescent; Child; Confidence Intervals; Female; Growth Disorders [*drug therapy, etiology]; Growth [*drug effects, physiology]; Homozygote; Human Growth Hormone [*therapeutic use]; Humans; Male; beta-Thalassemia [*complications, genetics]","10.1002/14651858.CD012284.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012284.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Sickle cell disease can cause severe pain, significant end‐organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Stroke affects around 10% of children with sickle cell anaemia (HbSS). Chronic blood transfusions may reduce the risk of vaso‐occlusion and stroke by diluting the proportion of sickled cells in the circulation. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002, and last updated in 2017. Objectives To assess risks and benefits of chronic blood transfusion regimens in people with sickle cell disease for primary and secondary stroke prevention (excluding silent cerebral infarcts). Search methods We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980), and ongoing trial databases; all searches current to 8 October 2019. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 19 September 2019. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing red blood cell transfusions as prophylaxis for stroke in people with sickle cell disease to alternative or standard treatment. There were no restrictions by outcomes examined, language or publication status. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and the risk of bias and extracted data. Main results We included five trials (660 participants) published between 1998 and 2016. Four of these trials were terminated early. The vast majority of participants had the haemoglobin (Hb)SS form of sickle cell disease. Three trials compared regular red cell transfusions to standard care in primary prevention of stroke: two in children with no previous long‐term transfusions; and one in children and adolescents on long‐term transfusion. Two trials compared the drug hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) and phlebotomy to long‐term transfusions and iron chelation therapy: one in primary prevention (children); and one in secondary prevention (children and adolescents). The quality of the evidence was very low to moderate across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to the trials being at a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, indirectness and imprecise outcome estimates. Red cell transfusions versus standard care Children with no previous long‐term transfusions Long‐term transfusions probably reduce the incidence of clinical stroke in children with a higher risk of stroke (abnormal transcranial doppler velocities or previous history of silent cerebral infarct), risk ratio 0.12 (95% confidence interval 0.03 to 0.49) (two trials, 326 participants), moderate quality evidence. Long‐term transfusions may: reduce the incidence of other sickle cell disease‐related complications (acute chest syndrome, risk ratio 0.24 (95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.48)) (two trials, 326 participants); increase quality of life (difference estimate ‐0.54, 95% confidence interval ‐0.92 to ‐0.17) (one trial, 166 participants); but make little or no difference to IQ scores (least square mean: 1.7, standard error 95% confidence interval ‐1.1 to 4.4) (one trial, 166 participants), low quality evidence. We are very uncertain whether long‐term transfusions: reduce the risk of transient ischaemic attacks, Peto odds ratio 0.13 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 2.11) (two trials, 323 participants); have any effect on all‐cause mortality, no deaths reported (two trials, 326 participants); or increase the risk of alloimmunisation, risk ratio 3.16 (95% confidence interval 0.18 to 57.17) (one trial, 121 participants), very low quality evidence. Children and adolescents with previous long‐term transfusions (one trial, 79 participants) We are very uncertain whether continuing long‐term transfusions reduces the incidence of: stroke, risk ratio 0.22 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 4.35); or all‐cause mortality, Peto odds ratio 8.00 (95% confidence interval 0.16 to 404.12), very low quality evidence. Several review outcomes were only reported in one trial arm (sickle cell disease‐related complications, alloimmunisation, transient ischaemic attacks). The trial did not report neurological impairment, or quality of life. Hydroxyurea and phlebotomy versus red cell transfusions and chelation Neither trial reported on neurological impairment, alloimmunisation, or quality of life. Primary prevention, children (one trial, 121 participants) Switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy may have little or no effect on liver iron concentrations, mean difference ‐1.80 mg Fe/g dry‐weight liver (95% confidence interval ‐5.16 to 1.56), low quality evidence. We are very uncertain whether switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy has any effect on: risk of stroke (no strokes); all‐cause mortality (no deaths); transient ischaemic attacks, risk ratio 1.02 (95% confidence interval 0.21 to 4.84); or other sickle cell disease‐related complications (acute chest syndrome, risk ratio 2.03 (95% confidence interval 0.39 to 10.69)), very low quality evidence. Secondary prevention, children and adolescents (one trial, 133 participants) Switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy may: increase the risk of sickle cell disease‐related serious adverse events, risk ratio 3.10 (95% confidence interval 1.42 to 6.75); but have little or no effect on median liver iron concentrations (hydroxyurea, 17.3 mg Fe/g dry‐weight liver (interquartile range 10.0 to 30.6)); transfusion 17.3 mg Fe/g dry‐weight liver (interquartile range 8.8 to 30.7), low quality evidence. We are very uncertain whether switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy: increases the risk of stroke, risk ratio 14.78 (95% confidence interval 0.86 to 253.66); or has any effect on all‐cause mortality, Peto odds ratio 0.98 (95% confidence interval 0.06 to 15.92); or transient ischaemic attacks, risk ratio 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.25 to 1.74), very low quality evidence. Authors' conclusions There is no evidence for managing adults, or children who do not have HbSS sickle cell disease. In children who are at higher risk of stroke and have not had previous long‐term transfusions, there is moderate quality evidence that long‐term red cell transfusions reduce the risk of stroke, and low quality evidence they also reduce the risk of other sickle cell disease‐related complications. In primary and secondary prevention of stroke there is low quality evidence that switching to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy has little or no effect on the liver iron concentration. In secondary prevention of stroke there is low‐quality evidence that switching to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy increases the risk of sickle cell disease‐related events. All other evidence in this review is of very low quality. Plain language summary Long‐term blood transfusions to prevent a stroke in people with sickle cell disease Review question We wanted to determine if long‐term blood transfusions given to people with sickle cell disease who are at a higher risk of stroke (primary prevention) or have had a previous stroke (secondary prevention) decreases their risk of a subsequent stroke without causing severe side effects. We compared long‐term blood transfusions to standard treatment or other ways of preventing a stroke. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Interventions for silent stroke are addressed in a separate Cochrane Review. Background Sickle cell disease is a serious inherited blood disorder where the red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body, develop abnormally. Normal red blood cells are flexible and disc‐shaped, but in sickle cell disease they can become rigid, crescent shaped and also stickier. This can lead to blockage of blood vessels, resulting in tissue and organ damage and episodes of severe pain. The abnormal blood cells are more fragile and break apart, which leads to a decreased number of red blood cells, known as anaemia. Sickled red blood cells can block flow in blood vessels in the brain, leading to strokes. Strokes occur in up to 10% of children with sickle cell anaemia (HbSS) and can cause limb weakness, slurred speech, seizures, and cognitive impairment. Two tests have been used in trials to identify children at higher risk of having a first stroke. One (transcranial Doppler ultrasonography) measures the speed of blood flowing through arteries in the brain, and those children with high blood flow are at increased risk of a stroke. The other (magnetic resonance imaging) takes images of the brain to see if there are any small areas of damage (silent strokes), those children with evidence of damage are at increased risk of stroke. Blood transfusions may help prevent a stroke by reducing the level of anaemia, diluting the sickled red blood cells, and increasing the level of oxygen in the blood. Blood transfusions can be linked to adverse events, e.g. the development of antibodies to proteins on donor red blood cells (alloimmunisation), accumulation of too much iron in the body from repeated transfusions, increased risk of infection, and extended length of stay in hospital. Search date The evidence is current to: 8 October 2019. Study characteristics We found five randomised controlled trials which enrolled a total of 660 participants. Three trials compared blood transfusions to no blood transfusions and two trials compared blood transfusion to the drug hydroxyurea. Trials were published between 1998 and 2016 and included children and sometimes adolescents; the majority had one form of sickle cell disease (HbSS). All trials received government funding. Key Results In children who are at a higher risk of having a stroke who have not had previous blood transfusions, a long‐term blood transfusion regime probably reduces clinical strokes, and may also reduce other sickle cell disease‐related complications. We are very uncertain if stopping blood transfusions in children and adolescents receiving transfusions for a long time (greater than 12 months) increases the risk of stroke. We are very uncertain whether switching from long‐term transfusions with iron chelation to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy has any effect on stroke, mortality, or sickle cell disease‐related complications in children who have not had a stroke. Hydroxyurea may have little or no effect on iron levels in the liver. We are very uncertain if switching from long‐term transfusions with iron chelation to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy increases the risk of stroke or mortality in children and adolescents who have had a stroke and were previously receiving regular transfusions. Switching from long‐term transfusions to hydroxyurea may increase some sickle cell disease‐related serious adverse events such as painful crises. Quality of the evidence In children at higher risk of stroke who have not had previous long‐term transfusions, there is moderate quality evidence that long‐term red cell transfusions reduce the risk of stroke. The quality of evidence was rated as low to very low for the rest of the outcomes due to trials being at high risk of bias and because there were a small number of trials and a small number of participants included in the trials.","7","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Erythrocyte Transfusion [adverse effects]; *Primary Prevention; *Secondary Prevention; Adolescent; Anemia, Sickle Cell [blood, *complications]; Antisickling Agents [adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Blood Transfusion; Child; Child, Preschool; Early Termination of Clinical Trials; Hemoglobin, Sickle; Humans; Hydroxyurea [adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Iron Chelating Agents [therapeutic use]; Phlebotomy [adverse effects]; Stroke [etiology, *prevention & control]; Young Adult","10.1002/14651858.CD003146.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003146.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives To determine the impact of any surgical procedure compared with other surgical interventions or non‐surgical procedures, on avascular necrosis of bone in people with sickle cell disease in terms of efficacy and safety. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Additional trials were sought from both ongoing trial registries and the reference lists of papers identified by the search strategy. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 17 September 2019. Selection criteria Randomized clinical trials comparing specific therapies for avascular necrosis of bone in people with sickle cell disease. Data collection and analysis Each author independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Given only one trial was identified, meta‐analyses were not possible. Main results One trial (46 participants) was eligible for inclusion. After randomization eight participants were withdrawn, mainly because they declined to participate in the trial. Data were analysed for 38 participants at the end of the trial. After a mean follow‐up of three years, hip core decompression and physical therapy did not show clinical improvement when compared with physical therapy alone using the score from the original trial (an improvement of 18.1 points for those treated with intervention therapy versus an improvement of 15.7 points with control therapy). We are very uncertain whether there is any difference between groups regarding major complications (hip pain, risk ratio 0.95 (95% confidence interval 0.56 to 1.60; vaso‐occlusive crises, risk ratio 1.14 (95% confidence interval 0.72 to 1.80; very low quality of evidence); and acute chest syndrome, risk ratio 1.06 (95% confidence interval 0.44 to 2.56; very low quality of evidence)). This trial did not report results on mortality or quality of life. Authors' conclusions We found no evidence that adding hip core decompression to physical therapy achieves clinical improvement in people with sickle cell disease with avascular necrosis of bone compared to physical therapy alone. However, we highlight that our conclusion is based on one trial with high attrition rates. Further randomized controlled trials are necessary to evaluate the role of hip‐core depression for this clinical condition. Endpoints should focus on participants' subjective experience (e.g. quality of life and pain) as well as more objective 'time‐to‐event' measures (e.g. mortality, survival, hip longevity). The availability of participants to allow adequate trial power will be a key consideration for endpoint choice. Plain language summary Treatments for people with sickle cell disease in whom poor blood supply to an area of bone leads to bone death Review question   We reviewed the effects of treatments for avascular necrosis of bone in people with sickle cell disease. Background   Many people with sickle cell disease experience bone death due to temporary or permanent loss of blood supply to parts of their bones. This can be very painful. The bones usually affected are the thigh bones at the hip joint and the arm bones at the shoulder joint. The aim of treatment is to stop the pain and maintain a mobile joint. Treatments include resting the joint, physiotherapy, the use of pain relief, joint replacements and bone grafts. However, complications from surgery may be more frequent in people with sickle cell disease. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Search date   The evidence is current to: 17 September 2019. Study characteristics   We found one eligible trial, published in 2006, which analysed data from 38 people from 32 different treatment centers from the USA. The trial compared a treatment of surgery and physical therapy with physical therapy on its own. This trial did not show that the addition of surgery to a physical therapy regimen could improve the outcome for people with sickle cell disease and avascular necrosis. Key results After a mean follow‐up of three years, the combination of surgery and physical therapies did not show clinical improvement when compared with physical therapy alone. Given that the results are imprecise, we are uncertain as to whether surgery and physical therapies in combination has an important effect on hip pain, vaso‐occlusive crises and acute chest syndrome. Trial authors did not report information on mortality and quality of life. Quality of the evidence   The limited number of participants included in the study led to imprecise results, therefore, the confidence in the results is very low.","12","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Anemia, Sickle Cell [*complications]; Humans; Osteonecrosis [*etiology, *therapy]; Physical Therapy Modalities; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD004344.pub7","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004344.pub7","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

The main therapeutic interventions include preventive and supportive measures. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantations are carried out with the aim of replacing the defective cells and their progenitors (hematopoietic (i.e. blood forming) stem cells) in order to correct the disorder. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To determine whether stem cell transplantation can improve survival and prevent symptoms and complications associated with sickle cell disease. To examine the risks of stem cell transplantation against the potential long‐term gain for people with sickle cell disease. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register complied from electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (updated each new issue of the Cochrane Library) and quarterly searches of MEDLINE. We also searched trial registries for ongoing trials up to April 2020. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 09 December 2019. Selection criteria Randomized controlled and quasi‐randomized trials that compared any method of stem cell transplantation with either each other or with any of the preventive or supportive interventions (e.g. periodic blood transfusion, use of hydroxyurea, antibiotics, pain relievers, supplemental oxygen) in people with sickle cell disease irrespective of the type of sickle cell disease, gender and setting. Data collection and analysis No trials were eligible for inclusion in the review. Main results We identified 12 potentially‐eligible trials by the searches; we excluded 11 of these and the remaining trial is an ongoing trial that may be eligible for inclusion in a future version of the review. Authors' conclusions Reports on the use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation improving survival and preventing symptoms and complications associated with sickle cell disease are currently limited to observational and other less robust studies. We did not find any eligible randomized controlled trials assessing the benefit or risk of hematopoietic stem cell transplantations. However, there is an ongoing quasi‐randomized trial comparing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with standard care, Thus, this systematic review identifies the need for a multicentre randomized controlled trial assessing the benefits and possible risks of hematopoietic stem cell transplantations comparing sickle status and severity of disease in people with sickle cell disease. Plain language summary Transplantation of blood‐forming stem cells for children with sickle cell disease Review question We reviewed the evidence about the cure rate and risks of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for people with sickle cell disease. Background Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder mainly characterized by the presence of deformed, sickle‐shaped red blood cells in the blood stream. These cells deprive tissues of blood and oxygen resulting in periodic and recurrent painful attacks. Complications include acute chest syndrome and stroke. Although sickle cell disease is responsive to preventive and supportive measures such as the use of prophylactic antibodies and periodic blood transfusion, these do not provide a cure. The use of hematopoietic (blood forming) stem cell transplantation involves replacing the deformed red blood cells and its stem cells with stem cells from a healthy donor thereby producing normal red blood cells. These stem cells can be derived from either the bone marrow or blood (umbilical cord blood or peripheral blood) of a healthy individual. This is an update of a previously published review. Search date The evidence is current to: 09 December 2019. Study characteristics There are no trials included in the review. There is one ongoing trial which may, in the future, be eligible for inclusion. Key results There are currently no randomized controlled trials assessing the benefits and risks; the most appropriate source of stem cells; or the most eligible participants (those who have experience severe complication or those who have not) of the procedure in people with sickle cell disease.","7","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Anemia, Sickle Cell [*surgery]; Child; Humans","10.1002/14651858.CD007001.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007001.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Vitamin K is known to play an important role in both blood coagulation and bone formation, hence the role of supplementation of vitamin K in this category needs to be reviewed. This is an updated version of the review. Objectives To assess the effects of vitamin K supplementation in people with cystic fibrosis and to investigate the hypotheses that vitamin K will decrease deficiency‐related coagulopathy, increase bone mineral density, decrease risk of fractures and improve quality of life in people with CF. Also to determine the optimal dose and route of administration of vitamin K for people with CF (for both routine and therapeutic use). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Most recent search: 12 August 2019. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of all preparations of vitamin K used as a supplement compared to either no supplementation (or placebo) at any dose or route and for any duration, in patients with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened papers, extracted trial details and assessed their risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE criteria. Main results Three trials (total 70 participants, aged 8 to 46 years) assessed as having a moderate risk of bias were included. One trial compared vitamin K to placebo, a second to no supplementation and the third compared two doses of vitamin K. No trial in either comparison reported our primary outcomes of coagulation and quality of life or the secondary outcomes of nutritional parameters and adverse events. Vitamin K versus control Two trials compared vitamin K to control, but data were not available for analysis. One 12‐month trial (n = 38) compared 10 mg vitamin K daily or placebo in a parallel design and one trial (n = 18) was of cross‐over design with no washout period and compared 5 mg vitamin K/week for four‐weeks to no supplementation for four‐weeks. Only the 12‐month trial reported on the primary outcome of bone formation; we are very uncertain whether vitamin K supplementation has any effect on bone mineral density at the femoral hip or lumbar spine (very low‐quality evidence). Both trials reported an increase in serum vitamin K levels and a decrease in undercarboxylated osteocalcin levels. The cross‐over trial also reported that levels of proteins induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKA) showed a decrease and a return to normal following supplementation, but due to the very low‐quality evidence we are not certain that this is due to the intervention. High‐dose versus low‐dose vitamin K One parallel trial (n = 14) compared 1 mg vitamin K/day to 5 mg vitamin K/day for four weeks. The trial did report that there did not appear to be any difference in serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin or vitamin K levels (very low‐quality evidence). While the trial reported that serum vitamin K levels improved with supplementation, there was no difference between the high‐dose and low‐dose groups. Authors' conclusions There is very low‐quality evidence of any effect of vitamin K in people with cystic fibrosis. While there is no evidence of harm, until better evidence is available the ongoing recommendations by national CF guidelines should be followed. Plain language summary Vitamin K supplementation for cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence to see whether supplementing vitamin K in people with cystic fibrosis counteracts the effects of deficiency on blood clotting, bone strength and quality of life in people with cystic fibrosis. We tried to determine the best dose needed to prevent this deficiency. This is an update of an earlier review. Background Cystic fibrosis is an inherited condition which causes disease, most noticeably in the lungs, digestive system and pancreas. In people with cystic fibrosis, the pancreas often does not produce enough enzymes to allow the body to absorb digested food properly and this may also be linked to deficiencies of fat‐soluble vitamins like vitamin K. Vitamin K is needed for adequate blood clotting, bone formation and some metabolic functions. Search date The evidence is current to: 12 August 2019. Study characteristics We included three trials (total of 70 participants aged between 8 and 46 years) in the review. Two trials compared vitamin K to a control. In the first trial all 18 people taking part (aged 13 to 35 years) were given 5 mg oral vitamin K supplement once a week or nothing for a total duration of one month and then they swapped to the other group for another month. Unfortunately, we could not analyse the data from this trial because the investigators did not report data just from the first part of the trial (only from the end of the trial when everyone taking part had been in both groups), so we could not tell if the effects were due to supplements or no supplements. In the second trial a total of 38 people aged 16 to 45 years took part. They were given either 10 mg vitamin K or placebo (a dummy supplement not containing any vitamin K) every day for 12 months, but the investigators did not state how many people were in each group so we could not analyse the results. In the third trial (14 children aged 8 to 18 years old) participants were given oral vitamin K supplements, half of them at a dose of 1 mg every day and the other half were given 5 mg every day for one month. Key results No trial in either comparison reported our primary outcomes of blood clotting and quality of life or the secondary measures of nutrition and adverse events. Vitamin K versus control Only the 12‐month trial reported on the primary outcome of bone formation; we are very uncertain whether vitamin K supplementation has any effect on bone mineral density measured at the hip or lower back (very low‐quality evidence). Both trials reported an increase in vitamin K levels in the blood and a decrease in undercarboxylated osteocalcin levels (this is an indicator of the risk of hip fracture). The four‐week trial also reported that levels of proteins induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKA) dropped and returned to normal levels, but due to the very low‐quality evidence we are not certain that this is due to supplementation. High‐dose versus low‐dose vitamin K The trial reported that while vitamin K levels improved there did not seem to be any difference between the high‐dose and low‐dose groups. There also did not seem to be any difference in undercarboxylated osteocalcin levels (very low‐quality evidence). Quality of the evidence The overall quality of the evidence was judged to be very low due to risks of bias in the design of all trials and the low numbers of participants.","6","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adolescent; Adult; Biomarkers [blood]; Blood Coagulation [drug effects]; Bone Density; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*blood, complications]; Dietary Supplements; Fractures, Bone [prevention & control]; Humans; Middle Aged; Osteocalcin [blood]; Osteogenesis [*drug effects]; Protein Precursors [blood]; Prothrombin; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Vitamin K Deficiency [complications, *drug therapy]; Vitamin K [*administration & dosage, blood]; Vitamins [*administration & dosage]","10.1002/14651858.CD008482.pub6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008482.pub6","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Sickle cell disease is one of the most common severe monogenic disorders in the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. The two most common chronic chest complications due to sickle cell disease are pulmonary hypertension and chronic sickle lung disease. These complications can lead to morbidity (such as reduced exercise tolerance) and increased mortality. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2011 and updated in 2014 and 2016. Objectives We wanted to determine whether trials involving people with sickle cell disease that compare regular long‐term blood transfusion regimens with standard care, hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) any other drug treatment show differences in the following: mortality associated with chronic chest complications; severity of established chronic chest complications; development and progression of chronic chest complications; serious adverse events. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register. Date of the last search: 19 September 2019. We also searched for randomised controlled trials in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, Issue 10, 14 November 2018), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), CINAHL (from 1937), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1950), and ongoing trial databases to 14 November 2018. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials of people of any age with one of four common sickle cell disease genotypes, i.e. Hb SS, Sβº, SC, or Sβ +  that compared regular red blood cell transfusion regimens (either simple or exchange transfusions) to hydroxycarbamide, any other drug treatment, or to standard care that were aimed at reducing the development or progression of chronic chest complications (chronic sickle lung and pulmonary hypertension). Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results No studies matching the selection criteria were found. Authors' conclusions There is a need for randomised controlled trials looking at the role of long‐term transfusion therapy in pulmonary hypertension and chronic sickle lung disease. Due to the chronic nature of the conditions, such trials should aim to use a combination of objective and subjective measures to assess participants repeatedly before and after the intervention. Plain language summary The effect of long‐term red blood cell transfusions on chronic chest complications of sickle cell disease Review question We reviewed the evidence to see if regular long‐term red blood cell transfusions helped to reduce the occurrence or progression of chronic chest complications compared to hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea), any other treatment or standard care in people with sickle cell disease. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Background Oxygen is transported from our lungs to all parts of our body by haemoglobin, which is a major component of red blood cells. Sickle cell disease is an inherited disorder of haemoglobin. In people with sickle cell disease red blood cells become rigid once they have given up their oxygen and are often shaped like crescents. These rigid cells can block blood vessels, which causes problems throughout the body, including the lungs. The two most common chronic chest complications due to sickle cell disease are pulmonary hypertension and chronic sickle lung disease. Pulmonary hypertension is high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries (the arteries that supply blood to the lungs). High blood pressure in these arteries are associated with an increased risk of death. Chronic sickle lung disease arises as a result of lung damage and loss of lung tissue. Regular blood transfusions for people with sickle cell disease reduce the amount of the person's own sickled cells in their blood by replacing them with donated, non‐sickled cells. Regular transfusions have already been shown to reduce the risk of strokes in people with sickle cell disease. We aimed to find out if regular long‐term blood transfusions in people with this disease lead to a reduction in new chronic chest complications or slowed the progression of any chronic chest complications that have already developed. We also aimed to consider death rates due to chronic chest complications and any adverse effects of the transfusion programme. Study characteristics The evidence is current to 19 September 2019. We found no studies in this update of the review. Key results There are no results because we found no relevant randomised controlled trials. We would need to design a study with at least 946 participants to be able to detect a decrease in the number of people who died from 12 in 100 to six in 100. Quality of the evidence There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to answer our review questions.","10","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Acute Chest Syndrome [etiology, *therapy]; Anemia, Sickle Cell [*complications]; Antisickling Agents [therapeutic use]; Erythrocyte Transfusion [*methods]; Humans; Hypertension, Pulmonary [etiology, *therapy]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD008360.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008360.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

For people with thalassemia, long‐term red blood cell transfusion remains the mainstay of therapy, which may lead to iron overload causing severe complications and damage in different body organs. Long‐term iron chelation therapy is essential for people with thalassemia to minimize the ongoing iron‐loading process. In addition, suboptimal adherence can increase adverse events associated with iron overload and result in increased morbidity, mortality, healthcare utilization and cost of care. Objectives To identify and assess the effects of computer and mobile technology interventions designed to facilitate medication adherence and disease management in individuals with thalassemia, including: ‐ evaluating the effects of using computer and mobile technology interventions for medication adherence and disease management on health and behavioral outcomes; ‐ identifying and assessing the effects of computer and mobile technology interventions specific to different age groups (children, adolescents and adults) and type of modality (e.g. cell phone, the Internet). Search methods We searched CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, Web of Science Science & Social Sciences Conference Proceedings Indexes, IEEE Xplore and ongoing trial databases (22 February 2018). We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group’s Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register (20 June 2019). We also searched for unpublished work in the abstract book of nine major conferences in the related field. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and quasi‐RCTs comparing single‐ or multi‐component interventions versus no intervention, placebo or standard care, with adherence to iron chelation as the primary outcome were eligible for inclusion. Non‐randomized studies of interventions, controlled before‐after studies, and interrupted‐time‐series studies were also eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Three authors independently assessed study eligibility. If we had included any studies, we would have independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data; we planned to assess the quality of the evidence using GRADE. Main results We did not identify any eligible studies for inclusion in the review. Authors' conclusions Due to lack of evidence, we cannot comment on the efficacy or effectiveness of computer and mobile technology intervention strategies to promote disease management and adherence to iron chelation therapy in people with thalassemia. We concluded that RCTs are needed to examine a variety of computer and mobile technology intervention strategies that may be useful for promoting disease management and increasing adherence to iron chelation therapy in individuals with thalassemia. Plain language summary Strategies to improve disease management and increase adherence to iron chelation therapy in people with thalassaemia Review question We wanted to see if there were any interventions using computer and mobile technology (e.g. cell phone, the Internet) that would help people manage their thalassemia better and adhere more to their iron chelation therapy. Background People with thalassaemia, who receive regular transfusions, are exposed to excess iron in their body. This can result in medical complications, including organ damage and death. Some medications are used to remove excess iron in the body, but these treatment schedules can be difficult to follow and have undesirable side effects. Search date The evidence is current to 20 June 2019. Study characteristics We searched the literature for both randomized and non‐randomized studies, and found none which were eligible for inclusion.

Many different pathogens, including bacteria, have been implicated as causative agents of acute chest syndrome. There is no standardized approach to antibiotic therapy and treatment is likely to vary from country to country. Thus, there is a need to identify the efficacy and safety of different antibiotic treatment approaches for people with sickle cell disease suffering from acute chest syndrome. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2007, and most recently updated in 2015. Objectives To determine whether an empirical antibiotic treatment approach (used alone or in combination): 1. is effective for acute chest syndrome compared to placebo or standard treatment; 2. is safe for acute chest syndrome compared to placebo or standard treatment; Further objectives are to determine whether there are important variations in efficacy and safety: 3. for different treatment regimens, 4. by participant age, or geographical location of the clinical trials. Search methods We searched The Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched the LILACS database (1982 to 23 October 2017), African Index Medicus (1982 to 23 October 2017) and trial registries (23 October 2017). Date of most recent search of the Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 10 July 2019. Selection criteria We searched for published or unpublished randomised controlled trials. Data collection and analysis Each author intended to independently extract data and assess trial quality by standard Cochrane methodologies, but no eligible randomised controlled trials were identified. Main results For this update, we were unable to find any randomised controlled trials on antibiotic treatment approaches for acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease. Authors' conclusions This update was unable to identify randomised controlled trials on efficacy and safety of the antibiotic treatment approaches for people with sickle cell disease suffering from acute chest syndrome. While randomised controlled trials are needed to establish the optimum antibiotic treatment for this condition, we do not envisage further trials of this intervention will be conducted, and hence the review will no longer be regularly updated. Plain language summary Antibiotics for treating acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effects and safety of antibiotics (alone or in combination) as compared to other antibiotics, placebo (a 'dummy' treatment) or standard treatment. We wanted to know if the different antibiotic treatments were effective, if they were safe, and which doses worked best for treating acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Background Sickle cell disease affects millions of people throughout the world. Acute chest syndrome is a major cause of illness and death in people with sickle cell disease. Symptoms include fever, chest pain and a raised white blood cell count. Acute infection of the lung tissue is a major cause of acute chest syndrome. Antibiotics are often given to treat these lung infections, but there is no worldwide standard treatment. Search date The evidence is current to: 10 July 2019. Study characteristics This update was unable to find any trials to include in this review. Key results While we conclude that a randomised controlled trial should attempt to answer these questions, we do not envisage further trials of this intervention will be conducted, and hence the review will no longer be regularly updated. Until there is firm evidence, clinicians should treat acute chest syndrome on a case by case basis and according to the diagnosis and the treatment available.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Acute Chest Syndrome [*drug therapy, microbiology]; Anti-Bacterial Agents [*therapeutic use]; Cough [drug therapy]; Fever [drug therapy]; Humans; Hypoxia [drug therapy]; Sputum [metabolism]","10.1002/14651858.CD006110.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006110.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

However, graft rejection is an important potential consequence after lung transplantation. Immunosuppressive therapy is needed to prevent episodes of graft rejection and thus subsequently reduce morbidity and mortality in this population. There are a number of classes of immunosuppressive drugs which act on different components of the immune system. There is considerable variability in the use of immunosuppressive agents after lung transplantation in cystic fibrosis. While much of the research in immunosuppressive drug therapy has focused on the general population of lung transplant recipients, little is known about the comparative effectiveness and safety of these agents in people with cystic fibrosis. This is the final update of a previously published review; no longer being updated due to a lack of research in the area. Objectives To assess the effects of individual drugs or combinations of drugs compared to placebo or other individual drugs or combinations of drugs in preventing rejection following lung transplantation in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register and scanned references of the potentially eligible study. We also searched the  www.clinicaltrials.gov  registry and the World Health Organisation (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) to obtain information on unpublished and ongoing studies. Date of latest search: 29 May 2018. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised studies. Data collection and analysis We independently assessed the studies identified from our searches for inclusion in the review. If we had found eligible studies to include in the review, we planned to independently extract data and assess the risk of bias. We planned to use GRADE to summarize our results through a summary of findings table for each comparison we could present in the review. Main results While five studies addressed the interventions of interest, we did not include them in the review because the investigators of the studies did not report any information specific to people with cystic fibrosis. Our attempts to obtain this information have not yet been successful.  Authors' conclusions The lack of currently available evidence makes it impossible to draw conclusions about the comparative efficacy and safety of the various immunosuppressive drugs among people with cystic fibrosis after lung transplantation. A 2013 Cochrane Review comparing tacrolimus with cyclosporine in all lung transplant recipients (not restricted to those with cystic fibrosis) reported no significant difference in mortality and risk of acute rejection. However, tacrolimus use was associated with lower risk of broncholitis obliterans syndrome and arterial hypertension and higher risk of diabetes mellitus. It should be noted that this wider review contained only a small number of included studies (n = 3) with a high risk of bias. Additional randomised studies are required to provide evidence for the benefit and safety of the use of immunosuppressive therapy among people with cystic fibrosis after lung transplantation. Plain language summary Drugs to suppress the immune system after lung transplantation in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed evidence to find out the effects of individual drugs or combinations of drugs when they are given to prevent donor lungs being rejected following transplantation in people with cystic fibrosis. We only considered randomised studies (where it is decided at random which drug volunteers are given) comparing individual drugs or combinations of drugs to a placebo (dummy treatment with no active medicine) or to each other. Background Lung transplantation is an available and realistic treatment option for people with cystic fibrosis whose lungs are severely damaged. However, as a natural defence mechanism, the body recognises a transplanted lung as foreign and activates the immune system to reject it. This is known as graft rejection. To prevent this, drugs are needed to suppress the immune system after lung transplantation. There are several different types of such drugs that act by suppressing different components of the immune system. Much of the research on such drugs has focused on all people who have had a lung transplant and not specifically on those with cystic fibrosis. Currently, clinicians do not all agree on a common way of using anti‐rejection drugs in people with cystic fibrosis after they have received a lung transplant. Search date The evidence is current to: 29 May 2018. Study characteristics Although we found five studies which looked at anti‐rejection drugs, they included people with a number of chronic conditions and not just cystic fibrosis. Key results The studies we found reported results from all volunteers combined and we were not able to isolate the results that were specific to people with cystic fibrosis. We contacted the researchers who conducted these studies, but they have not sent us the specific results we need.  There is a review of drugs to suppress the immune systems of people who have had lung transplants (not restricted to those with cystic fibrosis) and this only included three studies which the review authors judged to have a high risk of bias. The review did not find that any one drug was better than another for reducing the chances of death or acute rejection; but one drug (tacrolimus) led to a lower risk of long‐term rejection and high blood pressure, although there was a higher risk of diabetes. Research is needed on the use of drugs that suppress the immune system in people with cystic fibrosis who have received a lung transplant. Due to the lack of research in this area, we do not plan to update this review again.","6","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Lung Transplantation; Cystic Fibrosis [*surgery]; Graft Rejection [*prevention & control]; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents [*therapeutic use]","10.1002/14651858.CD009421.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009421.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

The need for frequent blood transfusions in this condition poses a difficult problem to healthcare systems. The most common cause of morbidity and mortality is cardiac dysfunction from iron overload. The use of iron chelation therapy has reduced the severity of systemic iron overload but specific, non‐toxic treatment is required for removal of iron from the myocardium. Objectives To assess the effects of calcium channel blockers combined with standard iron chelation therapy in people with transfusion‐dependent beta thalassaemia on the amount of iron deposited in the myocardium, on parameters of heart function, and on the incidence of severe heart failure or arrhythmias and related morbidity and mortality. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched ongoing trials databases, and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 24 February 2018. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials of calcium channel blockers combined with standard chelation therapy compared with standard chelation therapy alone or combined with placebo in people with transfusion‐dependent beta thalassaemia. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently applied the inclusion criteria for the selection of trials. Two authors assessed the risk of bias of trials and extracted data and a third author verified these assessments. The authors used the GRADE system to assess the quality of the evidence. Main results Two randomised controlled trials (n = 74) were included in the review; there were 35 participants in the amlodipine arms and 39 in the control arms. The mean age of participants was 24.4 years with a standard deviation of 8.5 years. There was comparable participation from both genders. Overall, the risk of bias in included trials was low. The quality of the evidence ranged across outcomes from low to high, but the evidence for most outcomes was judged to be low quality. Cardiac iron assessment, as measured by heart T2*, did not significantly improve in the amlodipine groups compared to the control groups at six or 12 months (low‐quality evidence). However, myocardial iron concentration decreased significantly in the amlodipine groups compared to the control groups at both six months, mean difference ‐0.23 mg/g (95% confidence interval ‐0.07 to ‐0.39), and 12 months, mean difference ‐0.25 mg/g (95% confidence interval ‐0.44 to ‐0.05) (low‐quality evidence). There were no significant differences between treatment and control groups in serum ferritin (low‐quality evidence), liver T2* (low‐quality evidence), liver iron content (low‐quality evidence) and left ventricular ejection fraction (low‐quality evidence). There were no serious adverse events reported in either trial; however, one trial (n = 59) reported mild adverse events, with no statistically significant difference between groups (low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions The available evidence does not clearly suggest that the use of calcium channel blockers is associated with a reduction in myocardial iron in people with transfusion‐dependent beta thalassaemia, although a potential for this was seen. There is a need for more long‐term, multicentre trials to assess the efficacy and safety of calcium channel blockers for myocardial iron overload, especially in younger children. Future trials should be designed to compare commonly used iron chelation drugs with the addition of calcium channel blockers to investigate the potential interplay of these treatments. In addition, the role of baseline myocardial iron content in affecting the response to calcium channel blockers should be investigated. An analysis of the cost‐effectiveness of the treatment is also required. Plain language summary Calcium channel blockers for preventing heart dysfunction related with iron overload in transfusion‐dependent beta thalassaemia Review question We reviewed the evidence on whether drugs can prevent heart dysfunction due to excessive iron deposits in the hearts of people with beta thalassaemia who receive regular blood transfusions. Background Beta thalassaemia is a common inherited blood disorder that causes anaemia. People with this disorder need frequent blood transfusions which result in excess iron deposited in the heart causing it to be damaged. Complications related to the heart are the most common cause of death and disability in these individuals. High levels of iron in the heart strongly predicts subsequent heart failure. It is common practice to give drugs to reduce iron in the body (known as chelators) but there is no specific treatment for reducing iron deposited in the heart and protecting it from damage. Drugs that block calcium channels in the heart have been shown to reduce iron entering into this organ. However, little is known about how effective and safe these drugs are in people with beta thalassaemia. Search date The evidence is current to 24 February 2018. Trial characteristics We included two trials (74 participants) in the review, an earlier pilot study and the later larger study. Participants had beta thalassaemia, significant iron overload, and were receiving standard chelation treatment; they had an average age of 24 years. They were randomly selected to be treated for 12 months with either amlodipine (a calcium channel blocker) in addition to their chelation drugs or with chelation drugs alone (in the earlier trial) or with chelation drugs together with a placebo (dummy drug with no active medication) in the later trial. Key results Although there was no significant decrease in the amount of iron in the heart (main outcome) seen after 12 months of treatment with amlodipine when measured in one way, there was a significant decrease after 12 months of treatment using another measurement. There was no difference in other outcomes such as iron levels in the blood or the liver or in a further measure of heart function. Even though no serious adverse events were noted, further trials are needed to assess the safety of this treatment. Further research with larger, long‐term trials is needed. Quality of the evidence Overall, the trials included in this review appeared to be well run. However, the main outcome was reported differently in both trials and several other outcomes were missing details. The quality of evidence was low for all outcomes.","7","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Blood Transfusion; Adolescent; Adult; Amlodipine [*therapeutic use]; Calcium Channel Blockers [therapeutic use]; Cardiomyopathies [*prevention & control]; Chelation Therapy [*methods]; Child; Combined Modality Therapy [methods]; Female; Ferritins [blood]; Humans; Iron Overload [*complications]; Iron [analysis]; Liver [chemistry]; Myocardium [chemistry]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Time Factors; Transfusion Reaction [*complications]; Young Adult; beta‐Thalassemia [*therapy]","10.1002/14651858.CD011626.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011626.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of all identified articles. Full texts were obtained from potentially relevant abstracts and two authors independently assessed these for inclusion based of the selection criteria. A third author verified trial eligibility. Two authors independently performed data extraction and risk of bias assessments using standardized forms. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Main results No eligible trials in people on continuous treatment with DOACs undergoing oral or dental procedures were identified. Three randomised trials and one quasi‐randomised trial (follow‐up in all was seven days) in people on continuous treatment with VKAs were included with a total of 253 participants (mean age 60 years). Two trials published in 1989 and 1993 compared the antifibrinolytic agent TXA with placebo in people using VKAs. Two other trials were published in 1999 and 2015 and compared TXA with gelatin sponge and sutures, and dry gauze compression, respectively. In all included trials, those who were treated with VKAs had international normalised ratio (INR) values within the therapeutic range and TXA was applied locally, not systemically. The two trials from 1989 and 1993 comparing TXA with placebo showed a statistically significant beneficial effect regarding the number of major postoperative bleeding episodes requiring intervention, with a pooled risk difference (RD) of ‐0.25 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.36 to ‐0.14) (128 participants) (moderate‐quality evidence). For the two trials that compared TXA with either gelatin sponge and sutures or with dry gauze compression, there was no difference between the TXA and the standard care group, RD 0.02 (95% CI ‐0.07 to 0.11) (125 participants) (moderate‐quality evidence). The combined RD of all included trials was ‐0.13 (95% CI ‐0.30 to 0.05) (moderate‐quality evidence). There were no side effects of antifibrinolytic therapy that required treatment withdrawal (128 participants) (moderate‐quality evidence). Despite heterogeneity between trials with respect to the different haemostatic measures used in the control groups, the trials were comparable regarding design and baseline participant characteristics. Overall, we considered the risk of bias to be low in the trials comparing TXA with placebo and moderate in the trials comparing TXA with alternative haemostatic measures. Authors' conclusions Based on the results of this Cochrane Review, there seems to be a beneficial effect of locally applied TXA in preventing oral bleeding in people on continuous treatment with VKAs undergoing minor oral surgery or dental extractions. However, the small number of identified randomised controlled trials, the relatively small number of participants included in the trials and the differences in standard therapy and treatment regimens between trials, do not allow us to conclude definite efficacy of antifibrinolytic therapy in this population. We were unable to identify any eligible trials in people on continuous treatment with DOACs undergoing oral or dental procedures. Therefore, a beneficial effect of antifibrinolytic therapy can currently only be assumed based on data from the people using VKAs. Plain language summary Drugs that prevent oral bleeding in people using oral anticoagulants undergoing minor oral surgery or dental extractions Review question We reviewed the evidence about whether antifibrinolytic medicine (drugs that prevent breakdown of a blood clot), such as tranexamic acid or epsilon aminocaproic acid, can prevent oral bleeding after minor oral surgery or dental extractions in people using oral anticoagulants (blood thinners that are taken by mouth) without interruption during the procedure. Background People on continuous oral anticoagulant treatment are at an increased risk of bleeding complications during and after oral surgery or dental extractions. There are two types of oral anticoagulant treatment: vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) (e.g. warfarin and coumarin) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) (e.g. dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban). DOACs are becoming an increasingly popular alternative for VKAs, traditionally used for preventing blood clotting in people at risk of thrombosis. The number of bleeds and the severity of each bleed depend on medication‐related factors (such as the degree of anticoagulation, measured by the international normalised ratio (INR)), surgery‐related factors (such as the size of the wound or the number of roots extracted), as well as patient‐related factors (such as inflammation of the gums or blood vessel diseases). The INR level is important to determine how well the anticoagulant treatment is preventing blood clots. Within the desired range of the INR level, a person has both the least risk of blood clotting complications and the least risk of excessive bleeding. In routine practice antifibrinolytic medicine is often used before, during and after minor oral surgery or dental extractions for people using oral anticoagulants. The question is whether there is reliable scientific evidence for this practice. Search date The evidence is current to: 04 January 2018. Study characteristics We did not find any trials of antifibrinolytic medicine for preventing bleeding after minor oral surgery or dental extractions in people using DOACs. This review includes four trials (253 participants) in people continuously treated with VKAs during minor oral surgery or dental extractions. The earliest included trial was published in 1989 and the most recent one in 2015. The mean age of all participants was 60 years. The follow‐up time in all trials was seven days. Key results Overall, the included trials showed a reduction in the number of bleeds after dental extraction when using tranexamic acid solution in the mouth. Combining the results of the separate trials it appeared that antifibrinolytic medication reduces the bleeding rate after dental extractions by 25% when compared to placebo ('dummy' treatment). However, there was no difference in bleeding rate between people treated with tranexamic acid and those treated with standard care (e.g. gauze compression or stitches). Side effects of the antifibrinolytic medication rarely occurred and did not lead to individuals discontinuing tranexamic acid treatment. No evidence was found for people being treated with DOACs. It could, however, be argued that, if antifibrinolytic medicine is effective in people on continuous treatment with VKAs, it might also work for people receiving other comparable anticoagulant drugs. Quality of evidence In relation to the review's two primary outcomes of number of postoperative bleeds and side effects of therapy, we judged there to be moderate‐quality evidence. In the two trials comparing tranexamic acid with placebo, the risk of bias, in relation to trial design, was considered to be low, in the two trials comparing tranexamic acid to standard care (gelatin sponge and sutures; or dry gauze compression) the risk of bias was considered to be moderate. This was mainly due to the lack of blinding (a way of making sure that the people involved in the trial do not know which trial arm they are assigned to) and inadequate allocation concealment (using the play of chance to assign participants to comparison groups to prevent selection bias) in two of these trials. There were differences between the trials with regards to different standard care treatments.","7","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Anticoagulants [administration & dosage, *adverse effects]; Antifibrinolytic Agents [*therapeutic use]; Humans; Middle Aged; Minor Surgical Procedures [*adverse effects]; Oral Hemorrhage [chemically induced, *prevention & control]; Oral Surgical Procedures [*adverse effects]; Tooth Extraction [adverse effects]; Tranexamic Acid [*therapeutic use]","10.1002/14651858.CD012293.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012293.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD009530.PUB4","Jain, K; Wainwright, C; Smyth, AR","Bronchoscopy‐guided antimicrobial therapy for cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2018","Abstract - Background Early diagnosis and treatment of lower respiratory tract infections are the mainstay of management of lung disease in cystic fibrosis. When sputum samples are unavailable, treatment relies mainly on cultures from oropharyngeal specimens; however, there are concerns regarding the sensitivity of these to identify lower respiratory organisms. Bronchoscopy and related procedures (including bronchoalveolar lavage) though invasive, allow the collection of lower respiratory specimens from non‐sputum producers. Cultures of bronchoscopic specimens provide a higher yield of organisms compared to those from oropharyngeal specimens. Regular use of bronchoscopy and related procedures may help in a more accurate diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections and guide the selection of antimicrobials, which may lead to clinical benefits. This is an update of a previous review. Objectives To evaluate the use of bronchoscopy‐guided antimicrobial therapy in the management of lung infection in adults and children with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of latest search: 30 August 2018. We also searched three registries of ongoing studies and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of latest search: 10 April 2018. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled studies including people of any age with cystic fibrosis, comparing outcomes following therapies guided by the results of bronchoscopy (and related procedures) with outcomes following therapies guided by the results of any other type of sampling (including cultures from sputum, throat swab and cough swab). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed their risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study investigators for further information. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE criteria. Main results The search identified 11 studies, but we only included one study enrolling infants with cystic fibrosis under six months of age and diagnosed through newborn screening (170 enrolled); participants were followed until they were five years old (data from 157 children). The study compared outcomes following therapy directed by bronchoalveolar lavage for pulmonary exacerbations with standard treatment based on clinical features and oropharyngeal cultures. We considered this study to have a low risk of bias; however, the statistical power to detect a significant difference in the prevalence of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  was limited due to the prevalence (of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  isolation in bronchoalveolar lavage samples at five years age) being much lower in both the groups compared to that which was expected and which was used for the power calculation. The sample size was adequate to detect a difference in high‐resolution computed tomography scoring. The quality of evidence for the key parameters was graded as low except high‐resolution computed tomography scoring and cost of care analysis, which were graded as moderate quality. At five years of age, there was no clear benefit of bronchoalveolar lavage‐directed therapy on lung function z scores or nutritional parameters. Evaluation of total and component high‐resolution computed tomography scores showed no significant difference in evidence of structural lung disease in the two groups. In addition, this study did not show any difference between the number of isolates of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  per child per year diagnosed in the bronchoalveolar lavage‐directed therapy group compared to the standard therapy group. The eradication rate following one or two courses of eradication treatment was comparable in the two groups, as were the number of pulmonary exacerbations. However, the number of hospitalizations was significantly higher in the bronchoalveolar lavage‐directed therapy group, but the mean duration of hospitalizations was significantly less compared to the standard therapy group. Mild adverse events were reported in a proportion of participants, but these were generally well‐tolerated. The most common adverse event reported was transient worsening of cough after 29% of procedures. Significant clinical deterioration was documented during or within 24 hours of bronchoalveolar lavage in 4.8% of procedures. Authors' conclusions This review, limited to a single, well‐designed randomized controlled study, shows no clear evidence to support the routine use of bronchoalveolar lavage for the diagnosis and management of pulmonary infection in pre‐school children with cystic fibrosis compared to the standard practice of providing treatment based on results of oropharyngeal culture and clinical symptoms. No evidence was available for adult and adolescent populations. Plain language summary Using samples obtained by bronchoscopy to decide how to treat lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about whether to use samples obtained by bronchoscopy when deciding how to treat lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Breathing problems in people with cystic fibrosis are mainly due to repeated lung infections. Growing bugs from samples of mucus coughed up from the lower airways often allows doctors to quickly identify the bug causing the infection and start treatment early. If people can not cough up mucus, swabs are taken from the upper throat to identify the bug causing infection in the lower airways‐but this may not be the most reliable method. During a bronchoscopy, clinicians examine the lower airways using a long, thin flexible tube with a light and camera at one end; they may also collect mucus. The person needs to be sedated or have a general anaesthetic. We do not know if treatment based on samples taken during a bronchoscopy is better than treatment based on throat swabs. This is an update of an already published review. Search date The evidence is current to: 10 April 2018. Study characteristics We searched for studies of people of any age, but this review only includes one study in which 170 babies with cystic fibrosis, aged less than six months, were divided into two groups completely at random. One group was given antibiotics based on samples taken by bronchoscopy and the other group based on samples taken from throat. The investigators measured outcomes at five years of age. A total of 157 children completed the study. Key results This study did not show any difference between the groups in terms of lung function, weight, body mass index or in the score calculated by a CT scan of the lungs at five years of age. There were no differences in how many children in each group had an infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  at five years of age, or per year of follow up, or how often a child was unwell with respiratory symptoms. Children in the bronchoscopy group were admitted to hospital more often although admissions were generally shorter than the other group. There was no difference in the overall cost of care between the two groups. Side effects reported during, and after bronchoscopy, were not serious; the most common side effect was increased coughing (in one third of children). There is currently not enough evidence to support the regular use of bronchoscopy to diagnose and treat lung infections in children with cystic fibrosis. Quality of the evidence Evidence was limited to only one well‐designed study. Overall quality of evidence was of low (for most outcomes) to moderate quality (for high‐resolution computed tomography scoring and cost of care analysis). Quality limitations were due to fewer children taking part in the study than the statisticians thought were needed to show true results for some outcomes. Since the treatment of a first infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  is highly successful, larger and longer studies are needed to detect small differences between the groups. Conducting such large studies is extremely difficult. Also, the study only included young children and we do not know if the results would be the same in other age groups.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Bronchoalveolar Lavage; Anti‐Bacterial Agents [*therapeutic use]; Bronchoscopy; Child, Preschool; Cystic Fibrosis [*microbiology]; Humans; Infant; Pseudomonas Infections [*drug therapy]; Pseudomonas aeruginosa [*isolation & purification]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD009530.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009530.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Before the implementation of  Haemophilus influenzae  type b conjugate vaccination in high‐income countries ,  this was responsible for a high mortality rate in children under five years of age .  In African countries, where coverage of this vaccination is still extremely low, Hib remains one of the most common causes of bacteraemias in children with SCD. The increased uptake of this conjugate vaccination may substantially improve the survival of children with SCD. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives The primary objective was to determine whether Hib conjugate vaccines reduce mortality and morbidity in children and adults with SCD. The secondary objectives were to assess the following in children and adults with SCD: the immunogenicity of Hib conjugate vaccines; the safety of these vaccines; and any variation in effect according to type of vaccine, mode of administration (separately or in combination with other vaccines), number of doses, and age at first dose. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched trial registries (04 July 2018) and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies to identify unpublished trials. Date of last search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinoapthies Trials Register: 18 December 2017. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing Hib conjugate vaccines with placebo or no treatment, or comparing different types of Hib conjugate vaccines in people with SCD. Data collection and analysis No trials of Hib conjugate vaccines in people with SCD were found. Main results There is an absence of evidence from RCTs relating to the subject of this review. Authors' conclusions There has been a dramatic decrease in the incidence of invasive Hib infections observed in the post‐vaccination era in people with SCD living in high‐income countries. Therefore, despite the absence of evidence from RCTs, it is expected that Hib conjugate vaccines may be useful in children affected with SCD, especially in African countries where there is a high prevalence of the disease. The implementation of childhood immunisation schedules, including universal Hib conjugate vaccination, may substantially improve the survival of children with SCD living in low‐income countries. We currently lack data to evaluate the potential effect of Hib vaccination among unvaccinated adults with SCD. Further research should assess the optimal Hib immunisation schedule in children and adults with SCD. Plain language summary Vaccines for preventing severe  Haemophilus influenzae  type b (Hib) infections in people with sickle cell disease Review question We reviewed the available evidence from randomised controlled trials about how effective and safe  Haemophilus influenzae  type b (Hib) conjugate vaccines are for people with sickle cell disease (SCD). This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Background People with SCD are at high risk of infection from Hib ,  which was responsible for a high death rate in children under five years of age before Hib conjugate vaccination was introduced in high‐income countries .  In African countries, where coverage for this vaccination is extremely low, Hib remains one of the most common causes of bacteraemias (bacteria in the blood) in children with SCD. Another Cochrane Review on conjugate vaccines for preventing Hib infections in children under five years of age has shown that Hib conjugate vaccines were safe and effective but it did not specifically look at children with SCD, who have a high risk of this infection. Search date The evidence is current to: 18 December 2017. Study characteristics We did not find any randomised controlled trials comparing Hib conjugate vaccines with placebo ('dummy' treatment) or no treatment in people with SCD. Key results and quality of the evidence There are no randomised controlled trials of this vaccine in people with SCD. However, there has been a dramatic decrease in the occurrence of severe Hib infections in children with SCD living in high‐income countries since the vaccination has been included in childhood immunisation schedules. Therefore, including universal Hib conjugate vaccination in low‐income countries may improve the survival of children with SCD. There is not enough data to allow us to assess the potential effect of Hib vaccination in unvaccinated adults with SCD.

Chronic, progressive lung disease is the most important cause of morbidity and mortality in the condition and is therefore the main focus of clinical care and research.  Staphylococcus aureus  is a major cause of chest infection in people with cystic fibrosis. Early onset, as well as chronic, lung infection with this organism in young children and adults results in worsening lung function, poorer nutrition and increases the airway inflammatory response, thus leading to a poor overall clinical outcome. There are currently no evidence‐based guidelines for chronic suppressive therapy for  Staphylococcus aureus  infection in cystic fibrosis such as those used for  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  infection. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the evidence regarding the effectiveness of long‐term antibiotic treatment regimens for chronic infection with methicillin‐sensitive  Staphylococcus aureus  (MSSA) infection in people with cystic fibrosis and to determine whether this leads to improved clinical and microbiological outcomes. Search methods Trials were identified by searching the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, MEDLINE, Embase, handsearching article reference lists and through contact with local and international experts in the field. Date of the last search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 09 February 2018. We also searched ongoing trials databases. Date of latest search: 20 May 2018.

Authors' conclusions No randomised controlled trials were identified which met the inclusion criteria for this review. Although methicillin‐sensitive  Staphylococcus aureus  is an important and common cause of lung infection in people with cystic fibrosis, there is no agreement on how best to treat long‐term infection. The review highlights the need to organise well‐designed trials that can provide evidence to support the best management strategy for chronic methicillin‐sensitive  Staphylococcus aureus  infection in people with cystic fibrosis. Plain language summary Treatment for chronic  Staphylococcus aureus  chest infection in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We looked for evidence to see whether long‐term antibiotic treatment for chronic infection with methicillin‐sensitive  Staphylococcus aureus  (MSSA) in people with cystic fibrosis would lead to improved clinical outcomes and better results for measures of infection Background Cystic fibrosis is an inherited condition that causes thick mucus to build up in the lungs leading to persistent infection with bacteria. Methicillin‐sensitive  Staphylococcus aureus  (also known as MSSA), is the name given to a particular bacteria which is a common cause of lung infection in people with cystic fibrosis. It can cause long‐term infection in people with cystic fibrosis which leads to worsening lung function and poor overall clinical outcome.

"CD012082.PUB2","Fortin, PM; Hopewell, S; Estcourt, LJ","Red blood cell transfusion to treat or prevent complications in sickle cell disease: an overview of Cochrane reviews","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2018","Abstract - Background Globally, sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end‐organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are used to treat complications of SCD, e.g. acute chest syndrome (ACS) (this often involves a single transfusion episode), or they can be part of a regular long‐term transfusion programme to prevent SCD complications. Objectives To summarize the evidence in Cochrane Reviews of the effectiveness and safety of RBC transfusions versus no transfusion, or restrictive (to increase the total haemoglobin) versus liberal (to decrease the haemoglobin S level below a specified percentage) transfusion, for treating or preventing complications experienced by people with SCD. Methods We included Cochrane Reviews of randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, that addressed various SCD complications and had RBC transfusion as an intervention or comparator. We assessed the methodological quality of included reviews according to the AMSTAR quality assessment. Main results We included 15 Cochrane Reviews, 10 of which had no included studies with an RBC transfusion intervention (five reported RCTs with other interventions; and five contained no studies). Five of the 15 reviews included participants randomised to RBC transfusion, but in one of these reviews only 10 participants were randomised with no usable data. Four reviews (nine trials with 1502 participants) reported data comparing short‐ or long‐term RBC transfusions versus standard care, disease‐modifying agents, a restrictive versus a liberal transfusion strategy and long‐term RBC transfusions versus transfusions to treat complications. All reviews were of high quality according to AMSTAR quality assessment, however, the quality of the included trials was highly variable across outcomes. Trials were downgraded according to GRADE methodology for risk of bias, indirectness (most trials were conducted in children with HbSS), and imprecision (outcomes had wide confidence intervals). In all four reviews and all comparisons there was little or no difference in the risk of death (very low‐quality evidence). There were either no deaths or death was a rare event. Short‐term RBC transfusion versus standard care  (one review: two trials, 434 participants, GRADE very low‐ to low‐quality evidence)  In people undergoing low‐ to medium‐risk surgery, RBC transfusions may decrease the risk of acute chest syndrome (ACS) in people with African haplotypes compared to standard care (low‐quality evidence), but there was little or no difference in people with the Arabic haplotype (very‐low quality evidence). There was also little or no difference in the risk of other SCD‐related or transfusion‐related complications (very‐low quality evidence). Long‐term RBC transfusion versus standard care  (two reviews: three trials, 405 participants, very low‐ to moderate‐quality evidence)  In children and adolescents at high risk of stroke (abnormal transcranial doppler (TCD) velocities or silent cerebral infarct (SCI)), long‐term RBC transfusions probably decrease the risk of stroke (moderate‐quality evidence) and may decrease the risk of ACS and painful crisis compared to standard care (low‐quality evidence). Long‐term RBC transfusions may also decrease the risk of SCI in children with abnormal TCD velocities (low‐quality evidence), but there may be little or no difference in the risk of SCI in children with normal TCD velocities and previous SCI (low‐quality evidence). In children and adolescents already receiving long‐term RBC transfusions for preventing stroke, in comparison to standard care, continuing long‐term RBC transfusions may reduce the risk of SCI (low‐quality evidence) but we do not know whether there is a difference in the risk of stroke (very‐low quality evidence). In children with normal TCD velocities and SCI there was little or no difference in the risk of alloimmunisation or transfusion reactions, but RBC transfusions may increase the risk of iron overload (low‐quality evidence). Long‐term RBC transfusion versus RBC transfusion to treat complications  (one review: one trial, 72 participants, very low‐ to low‐quality evidence)  In pregnant women, long‐term RBC transfusions may decrease the risk of painful crisis compared to transfusion for complications (low‐quality evidence); but there may be little or no difference in the risk of other SCD‐related complications or transfusion reactions (very‐low quality evidence). RBC transfusion versus disease‐modifying agents (hydroxyurea)  (two reviews: two trials; 254 participants, very low‐ to low‐quality evidence)  For primary prevention of stroke in children, with abnormal TCD and no severe vasculopathy on magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography (MRI/MRA), who have received at least one year of RBC transfusions, we do not know whether there is a difference between RBC transfusion and disease‐modifying agents in the risk of stroke; SCI; ACS; or painful crisis (very‐low quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in the risk of iron overload (low‐quality evidence). Similarly, for secondary prevention of stroke in children and adolescents, we do not know whether there is a difference between these interventions in the risk of stroke; SCI; or ACS (very‐low quality evidence); but hydroxyurea with phlebotomy may increase the risk of painful crisis and global SCD serious adverse events compared to RBC transfusion (low‐quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in the risk of iron overload (low‐quality evidence). Restrictive versus liberal RBC transfusion strategy  (one review: one trial; 230 participants, very low‐quality evidence)  In people undergoing cholecystectomy, there was little or no difference between strategies in the risk of SCD‐related or transfusion‐related complications (very‐low quality evidence). Authors' conclusions This overview provides support from two high‐quality Cochrane Reviews for the use of RBC transfusions in preventing stroke in children and adolescents at high risk of stroke (abnormal TCDs or SCI) and evidence that it may decrease the risk of SCI in children with abnormal TCD velocities. In addition RBC transfusions may reduce the risk of ACS and painful crisis in this population. This overview highlights the lack of high‐quality evidence in adults with SCD and the number of reviews that have no evidence for the use of RBC transfusions across a spectrum of SCD complications. Also of concern is the variable and often incomplete reporting of patient‐relevant outcomes in the included trials such as SCD‐related serious adverse events and quality of life. Plain language summary An overview of Cochrane Reviews on red blood cell transfusions to treat or prevent sickle cell disease‐related complications Review question To summarize the evidence in Cochrane Reviews of the effectiveness and safety of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions for treating or preventing complications experienced by people with sickle cell disease (SCD). Background SCD is a serious inherited blood disorder where the RBCs, which carry oxygen around the body, develop abnormally. Normal RBCs are flexible and disc‐shaped, but in SCD they can become rigid and crescent shaped. Sickled cells are not only less flexible than healthy RBCs, they are also stickier. This can lead to the blockage of blood vessels, resulting in tissue and organ damage and episodes of severe pain. The abnormal RBCs are more fragile and break apart, which leads to fewer of them, known as anaemia. Overview characteristics We searched for Cochrane Reviews that analysed the data from randomised controlled trials (RCT; experiments that randomly allocate participants to one of two or more treatment groups), which looked at the effectiveness of RBC transfusions to prevent or treat SCD complications. This overview summarises the results of these reviews. Key results 15 reviews met the inclusion criteria for this overview. However, only four reviews (which included nine RCTs and 1052 participants) looked at the effects of RBCtransfusion and had results that could be reported. In the four reviews there was no difference in the risk of death with any comparison. We found that long‐term RBC transfusions compared to standard care, probably decrease the risk of stroke in children and adolescents at high risk of stroke (abnormal transcranial doppler (TCD) ultrasound (high blood flow to the brain) or a previous silent stroke (a stroke with no outward symptoms and where a person is typically unaware they have suffered a stroke)) and may also decrease their risk of painful crisis and acute chest syndrome. Red blood cell transfusions may also decrease the risk of silent stroke in children with abnormal TCD ultrasound when compared to standard care. We found there was a lack of evidence for treating adults with SCD‐related complications and that important outcomes, including quality of life were often not measured or reported. Quality of the reviews and evidence within reviews All reviews included in this review were of high quality and met Cochrane standards for systematic reviews. However, the quality of the trials included in the reviews was variable across the trials and in relation to the outcomes. The quality of the evidence within the trials was downgraded because trials had a high risk of bias, outcomes had imprecise measurements and much of the evidence applied only to children with HbSS disease. People with SCD are living longer and we need more high‐quality evidence on treating adults with SCD; as well as on the best treatment options, including the role of RBC transfusions, to treat SCD complications. We also need to improve and standardise the reporting of outcomes across trials.","8","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Erythrocyte Transfusion; *Systematic Reviews as Topic; Adolescent; Anemia, Sickle Cell [complications, *therapy]; Antisickling Agents [*therapeutic use]; Child; Humans; Hydroxyurea [*therapeutic use]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Stroke [*prevention & control]","10.1002/14651858.CD012082.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012082.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

It is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of alpha‐L‐iduronidase. Deficiency of this enzyme results in the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans within the tissues. The clinical manifestations are facial dysmorphism, hepatosplenomegaly, upper airway obstruction, skeletal deformity and cardiomyopathy. If Hurler syndrome is left untreated, death ensues by adolescence. There are more attenuated variants termed Hurler‐Scheie or Scheie syndrome, with those affected potentially not presenting until adulthood. Enzyme replacement therapy has been used for a number of years in the treatment of Hurler syndrome, although the current gold standard would be a haemopoietic stem cell transplant in those diagnosed by 2.5 years of age. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in 2013 and previously updated in 2015. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of treating mucopolysaccharidosis type I with laronidase enzyme replacement therapy as compared to placebo. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register, MEDLINE via OVID and Embase. Date of most recent search: 30 January 2019. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled studies of laronidase enzyme replacement therapy compared to placebo. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened the identified studies. The authors then appraised and extracted data. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Main results One study (45 participants) met the inclusion criteria. This double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, randomised, multinational study looked at laronidase at a dose of 0.58 mg/kg/week versus placebo in people with mucopolysaccharidosis type I. All primary outcomes listed in this review were studied in this study. The laronidase group achieved statistically significant improvements in per cent predicted forced vital capacity compared to placebo, MD 5.60 (95% confidence intervals 1.24 to 9.96) (low‐quality evidence) and in the six‐minute‐walk test (mean improvement of 38.1 metres in the laronidase group; P = 0.039, when using a prospectively planned analysis of covariance) (low‐quality evidence). The levels of urinary glycoaminoglycans were also significantly reduced (low‐quality evidence). In addition, there were improvements in hepatomegaly, sleep apnoea and hypopnoea. Laronidase antibodies were detected in nearly all participants in the treatment group with no apparent clinical effect and titres were reducing by the end of the study (very low‐quality evidence). Infusion‐related adverse reactions occurred in both groups but all were mild and none necessitated medical intervention or infusion cessation (low‐quality evidence). As assessed by questionnaires,changes in a 'Disability Index' after treatment were small and did not differ between groups (low‐quality evidence). There were no deaths in either group (low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions The current evidence demonstrates that laronidase is effective when compared to placebo in the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis type I. The included study was comprehensive, with few participants and of low quality. The study included all of the key outcome measures we wished to look at. It demonstrated that laronidase is efficacious in relation to reducing biochemical parameters (reduced urine glycosaminoglycan excretion) and improved functional capacity as assessed by forced vital capacity and the six‐minute‐walk test. In addition glycosaminoglycan storage was reduced as ascertained by a reduction in liver volume. Laronidase appeared to be safe and, while antibodies were generated, these titres were reducing by the end of the study. More studies are required to determine long‐term effectiveness and safety and to assess the impact upon quality of life. Enzyme replacement therapy with laronidase can be used pre‐ and peri‐haemopoietic stem cell transplant, which is now the gold standard treatment in those individuals diagnosed under 2.5 years of age. We do not anticipate any further trials to be undertaken and therefore do not plan to update this review. Plain language summary Enzyme replacement therapy with laronidase as a treatment for mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect and safety of enzyme replacement therapy with laronidase for people with mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) who do not undergo haemopoietic stem cell transplantation and in people with MPS I who receive enzyme replacement therapy prior to haemopoietic stem cell transplantation. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in 2013 and previously updated in 2015. Background Hurler syndrome or mucopolysaccharidosis type I is a rare genetic disorder that occurs when an enzyme that the body needs is missing or not working well enough. This leads to the build up of a number of complex molecules in certain cells and tissues. If untreated, this results in a classic picture of dwarfism, enlargement of body organs and a reduction in thinking ability. It occurs when a person inherits two copies of the defective gene (one from each parent) and is just as common in males as in females. It classically presents in infancy, however milder versions can present in adulthood. Enzyme replacement therapy with laronidase aims to replace the missing enzyme; however, given its high cost, it is essential to assess how effective and safe this treatment is. Search date The evidence is current to: 30 January 2019. Study characteristics One 26‐week randomised controlled study (45 participants) was included in the review. Participants were aged between six and 43 years old. The study was carried out in several centres around the world. Participants either received an intravenous infusion of laronidase 0.58 mg/kg or a placebo ('dummy' infusion). Key results Current evidence is limited because we only found one randomised clinical trial in the medical literature, which did not include very many participants. Compared with placebo, enzyme replacement therapy improved lung function, the individuals’ ability to walk, reduced the excretion of abnormal glycosaminoglycans (a type of carbohydrate molecule) in the urine and also reduced the stopping of breathing related to sleep. Adverse reactions in relation to the infusions occurred in both groups but all were mild and none required medical intervention or for the infusions to be stopped. Enzyme replacement therapy can be used before and around the time of stem cell transplant, which is now the gold standard treatment for Hurler syndrome in individuals diagnosed before the age of two and a half years. More studies are needed to look at the long‐term effects of this treatment and also to see the effects on the quality of life of these individuals. We do not anticipate any further trials to be undertaken and therefore do not plan to update this review. Quality of the evidence The included study was small and of low quality.","6","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Enzyme Replacement Therapy [methods]; *Iduronidase [therapeutic use]; *Mucopolysaccharidosis I [drug therapy]; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Humans; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD009354.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009354.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD008036.PUB5","Irons, JY; Petocz, P; Kenny, DT; Chang, AB","Singing as an adjunct therapy for children and adults with cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2019","Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis is a genetically inherited, life‐threatening condition that affects major organs. The management of cystic fibrosis involves a multi‐faceted daily treatment regimen that includes airway clearance techniques, pancreatic enzymes and other medications. Previous studies have found that compliance with this intensive treatment is poor, especially among adolescents. Because of both the nature and consequences of the illness and the relentless demands of the treatment, many individuals with cystic fibrosis have a poor quality of life. Anecdotal reports suggest that singing may provide both appropriate exercise for the whole respiratory system and a means of emotional expression which may enhance quality of life. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To evaluate the effects of singing as an adjunct therapy to standard treatment on the quality of life, morbidity, respiratory muscle strength and pulmonary function of children and adults with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Date of latest search: 07 January 2019. We also searched major allied complementary data bases, and clinical trial registers. Additionally, we handsearched relevant conference proceedings and journals. Date of latest search: 28 March 2019. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials in which singing (as an adjunct intervention) is compared with either a control intervention (for example, playing computer games or doing craft activities) or no singing in people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Results of searches were reviewed against pre‐determined criteria for inclusion. Only one eligible trial was available for analysis. Main results Since only one small study (n = 40) was included, no meta‐analysis could be performed. The included randomised controlled study was of parallel design and undertaken at two paediatric hospitals in Australia. The study evaluated the effects of a singing program on the quality of life and respiratory muscle strength of hospitalised children with cystic fibrosis (mean age 11.6 years, 35% male). While the singing group received eight individual singing sessions, the control group participated in preferred recreational activities, such as playing computer games or watching movies. This study was limited by a small sample size (51 participants) and a high drop‐out rate (21%).  There were no differences between the groups at either post‐intervention or follow‐up; although by the end of treatment there were some improvements in some of the domains of the quality of life questionnaire Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire‐Revised (e.g. emotional, social and vitality domains) for both singing and control groups. For the respiratory muscle strength indices, maximal expiratory pressure at follow‐up (six to eight weeks post‐intervention) was higher in the singing group, mean difference 25.80 (95% confidence interval 5.94 to 45.66). There was no difference between groups for any of the other respiratory function parameters (maximal inspiratory pressure, spirometry) at either post‐intervention or follow‐up. No adverse effects were observed in the singing group; adverse events for the control group were not reported in the paper. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of singing on quality of life or on the respiratory parameters in people with cystic fibrosis. However, there is growing interest in non‐medical treatments for cystic fibrosis and researchers may wish to investigate the impact of this inexpensive therapy on respiratory function and psychosocial well‐being further in the future. Plain language summary The effects of singing on lung function and quality of life in children and adults with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence of the effects of using singing as an add‐on treatment in children and adults with cystic fibrosis. Background People with cystic fibrosis are at risk of chest infections due to abnormally thick mucus in their airways. Airway clearance is therefore an important part of managing the condition. Increasing anecdotal reports suggest that singing may support lung function and enhance quality of life in people with cystic fibrosis. We searched for trials using the standard search methods of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group, and conducted extensive searches in other relevant databases and publications. This is an update of a previously published review. Search date The evidence is current to: 07 January 2019. Study characteristics The review includes one study with 40 children with cystic fibrosis aged between seven and 17 years of age. This study compared a specially designed singing intervention with other non‐physical leisure activities (recreation) and children were selected for the singing or the recreation program randomly. The study lasted two weeks and children were followed up for between six and eight weeks. The study assessed the impact of singing on respiratory muscle strength, quality of life and lung function tests. Key results Participants from both the singing and recreation groups reported some improvement in quality of life measurements. Participants in the singing group showed a greater increase in maximal expiratory pressure (a substitute measure of respiratory muscle strength test), while there was no improvement in this outcome for those in the recreation group. No adverse events were reported. There is currently not enough evidence to assess the effect of singing on clinical outcomes in people with cystic fibrosis. Future studies using robust methods are needed to assess the possible effects of singing for people with cystic fibrosis Quality of the evidence The included study was limited by the small number of participants (only 51 participants enrolled and only 40 were analysed) and a high drop‐out rate (21%). We also think the fact that the young people who were enrolled in the study were keen to sing, could have affected the study results.","7","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*therapy]; Humans; Music Therapy [*methods]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD008036.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008036.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

The use of this method of feeding is assessed on an individual basis taking into consideration the patients age and clinical status. This is a final update of a previously published review. Objectives To examine the evidence that in people with cystic fibrosis, supplemental enteral tube feeding improves nutritional status, respiratory function, and quality of life without significant adverse effects. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also contacted the companies that market enteral feeds and reviewed their databases. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 10 July 2019. Date of the most recent hand search of PubMed: 26 October 2018. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials comparing supplemental enteral tube feeding for one month or longer with no specific intervention in people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis The searches identified 44 trials; however, none were eligible for inclusion in this review. Main results There are no trials included in this review. Authors' conclusions Supplemental enteral tube feeding is widely used throughout the world to improve nutritional status in people with cystic fibrosis. The methods mostly used, nasogastric or gastrostomy feeding, are expensive and may have a negative effect on self‐esteem and body image. Reported use of enteral tube feeding suggests that it results in nutritional and respiratory improvement; but, efficacy has not been fully assessed by randomised controlled trials. It is acknowledged, however, that performing a randomised controlled trial would be difficult due to the ethics of withholding an intervention in a group of people whose nutritional status necessitates it. Plain language summary Tube feeding (mainly via the nose into the stomach or directly into the stomach) in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We planned to review the evidence about the effects of tube feeding (via either the nose or the stomach) in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Cystic fibrosis is an inherited condition which causes damage to the lungs and pancreas (an organ needed to produce chemicals that help to digest food). People with cystic fibrosis often need more calories in order to achieve a good nutritional status because their condition means food is not absorbed well and they burn more energy at rest and when breathing than people who don't have cystic fibrosis. They also often have poor appetites. Supplements are often given via a tube which is either placed through the nose into the stomach (nasogastric feeding) or directly into the stomach (gastrostomy feeding)), often overnight but sometimes during the day too. This type of feeding helps to improve weight gain, nutritional status, lung function and may improve quality of life. This is important as it is known that in cystic fibrosis nutritional status is closely linked to lung function. However, tube feeding is expensive and may also impact on self‐esteem and body image. Tubes through the nose may also become dislodged by coughing. Tube feeding may also cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, but these issues are usually resolved by either changing the type of feed, the rate of feeding or the way pancreatic enzymes are given. This is a final update of a previously published review. Search date We last searched for evidence on: 22 October 2018. Study characteristics We found 44 trials in our searches, but none matched the design and duration of the trials we wanted to examine. We therefore did not include any trials in this review. Key results Ideally, more research is needed to compare tube feeding with oral supplements and with normal diet. New trials should also look at when tube feeding should be started for the best results. These trials may be difficult to run as it may be wrong not to provide people with the extra calories they need, and when they need them, in this way.","7","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Cystic Fibrosis [*therapy]; Dietary Supplements; Enteral Nutrition [*methods]; Humans; Nutritional Status; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD001198.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001198.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Colonisation with  Burkholderia cepacia  complex species is linked to a more rapid decline in lung function and increases morbidity and mortality. There remain no objective guidelines for strategies to eradicate  Burkholderia cepacia  complex in cystic fibrosis lung disease, as these are inherently resistant to the majority of antibiotics and there has been very little research in this area. This review aims to examine the current treatment options for people with cystic fibrosis with acute infection with  Burkholderia cepacia  complex and to identify an evidence‐based strategy that is both safe and effective. This is an updated version of the review. Objectives To identify whether treatment of  Burkholderia cepacia  complex infections can achieve eradication, or if treatment can prevent or delay the onset of chronic infection. To establish whether following eradication, clinical outcomes are improved and if there are any adverse effects. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Last search: 12 March 2019. We also searched electronic clinical trials registers for the USA and Europe. Date of last search: 12 March 2019. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi‐randomised studies in people with cystic fibrosis of antibiotics or alternative therapeutic agents used alone or in combination, using any method of delivery and any treatment duration, to eradicate  Burkholderia cepacia  complex infections compared to another antibiotic, placebo or no treatment. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed for inclusion in the review the eligibility of 52 studies (79 references) identified by the search of the Group's Trial Register and the other electronic searches. Main results No studies looking at the eradication of  Burkholderia cepacia  complex species were identified. Authors' conclusions The authors have concluded that there was an extreme lack of evidence in this area of treatment management for people with cystic fibrosis. Without further comprehensive studies, it is difficult to draw conclusions about a safe and effective management strategy for  Burkholderia cepacia  complex eradication in cystic fibrosis. Thus, while the review could not offer clinicians evidence of an effective eradication protocol for  Burkholderia cepacia  complex, it has highlighted an urgent need for exploration and research in this area, specifically the need for well‐designed multi‐centre randomised controlled studies of a variety of (novel) antibiotic agents. Plain language summary Treatments to cure long‐term infections with  Burkholderia cepacia  in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence for antibiotic treatment to cure early infection with  Burkholderia cepacia  complex in people with cystic fibrosis and prevent it becoming permanent. Background Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease and people who have this disease produce large amounts of thick mucus which is difficult to clear. This mucus blocks up their lungs and digestive systems. People with cystic fibrosis suffer from lots of chest infections, which cause scarring of their airways. Eventually, they develop infections that can't be cured with antibiotics, so their lungs always contain lots of bugs, this is described as being chronically infected. One of these bugs,  Burkholderia cepacia , causes a lot of problems for people with cystic fibrosis because it is very difficult to treat and makes their lung disease deteriorate faster than it otherwise would. This is an updated version of the review. Search date We last searched for any evidence on 12 March 2019. Study characteristics We looked for studies of treatments which could eliminate  Burkholderia cepacia  from the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis. We did not find any relevant studies. This review highlights an urgent need for more research into new ways of treating long‐term  Burkholderia cepacia  infection in people with cystic fibrosis.","4","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Burkholderia cepacia complex; Anti‐Bacterial Agents [*therapeutic use]; Burkholderia Infections [*drug therapy]; Cystic Fibrosis [*microbiology]; Disease Eradication; Humans","10.1002/14651858.CD009876.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009876.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

The amount and severity of singular bleedings depend on disease‐related factors, such as the severity of the haemophilia, both local and systemic patient factors (such as periodontal inflammation, vasculopathy or platelet dysfunction) and intervention‐related factors (such as the type and number of teeth extracted or the dimension of the wound surface). Similar to local haemostatic measures and suturing, antifibrinolytic therapy is a cheap, safe and potentially effective treatment to prevent bleeding complications in individuals with bleeding disorders undergoing oral or dental procedures. However, a systematic review of trials reporting outcomes after oral surgery or a dental procedure in people with an inherited bleeding disorder, with or without, the use of antifibrinolytic agents has not been performed to date. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives Primarily, we aim to assess the efficacy of antifibrinolytic agents to prevent bleeding complications in people with haemophilia or VWD undergoing oral or dental procedures. Secondary objectives are to assess if antifibrinolytic agents can replace or reduce the need for clotting factor concentrate therapy in people with haemophilia or VWD and to establish the effects of these agents on bleeding in oral or dental procedures for each of these patient populations. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), of MEDLINE and from handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We additionally searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cinahl and the Cochrane Library. Additional searches were performed in ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). Date of last search of the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register: 01 March 2019. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials in people with haemophilia or VWD undergoing oral or dental procedures using antifibrinolytic agents (tranexamic acid or epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA)) to prevent perioperative bleeding compared to no intervention or usual care with or without placebo. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of all identified articles. Full texts were obtained for potentially relevant abstracts and two authors independently assessed these for inclusion based on the selection criteria. A third author verified trial eligibility. Two authors independently performed data extraction and risk of bias assessments using standardised forms. Main results While there were no eligible trials in people with VWD identified, two randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trials (total of 59 participants) in people with haemophilia undergoing dental extraction were included. One trial of tranexamic acid published in 1972 included 28 participants with mild, moderate or severe haemophilia A and B and one of EACA published in 1971 included 31 people with haemophilia with factor VIII or factor IX levels less than 15%. Overall, the two included trials showed a beneficial effect of tranexamic acid and EACA, administered systemically, in reducing the number of bleedings, the amount of blood loss and the need for therapeutic clotting factor concentrates. Regarding postoperative bleeding, the tranexamic acid trial showed a risk difference (RD) of ‐0.64 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.93 to ‐ 0.36) and the EACA trial a RD of ‐0.50 (95% CI 0.77 to ‐0.22). The combined RD of both trials was ‐0.57 (95% CI ‐0.76 to ‐0.37), with the quality of the evidence (GRADE) for this outcome is rated as moderate. Side effects occurred once and required stopping EACA (combined RD of ‐0.03 (95% CI ‐0.08 to 0.13). There was heterogeneity between the two trials regarding the proportion of people with severe haemophilia included, the concomitant standard therapy and fibrinolytic agent treatment regimens used. We cannot exclude that a selection bias has occurred in the EACA trial, but overall the risk of bias appeared to be low for both trials. Authors' conclusions Despite the discovery of a beneficial effect of systemically administered tranexamic acid and EACA in preventing postoperative bleeding in people with haemophilia undergoing dental extraction, the limited number of randomised controlled trials identified, in combination with the small sample sizes and heterogeneity regarding standard therapy and treatment regimens between the two trials, do not allow us to conclude definite efficacy of antifibrinolytic therapy in oral or dental procedures in people with haemophilia. No trials were identified in people with VWD. Plain language summary Drugs that prevent oral bleeding in people with haemophilia or Von Willebrand disease undergoing minor oral surgery or dental extractions Review question We reviewed the evidence about whether antifibrinolytic medicine (drugs that promote blood clotting) such as tranexamic acid or epsilon aminocaproic acid, can prevent oral bleeding in people with haemophilia or Von Willebrand disease undergoing minor oral surgery or dental extractions. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Background Haemophilia and Von Willebrand disease are inherited bleeding disorders. People with these disorders have an increased risk of bleeding complications during and after oral surgery or dental extractions, even if these are relatively minor and commonly performed. The number of bleeds and the severity of each depend on disease‐related factors (such as the severity of the haemophilia), as well as patient‐related factors (such as inflammation of the gums or blood vessel diseases) and intervention‐related factors (such as the type and the number of teeth extracted or how big the surface of the wound is). Measures such as giving clotting factors directly into the blood stream, are commonly used before, during or after surgery to prevent bleeding complications. However, these measures are costly and have risks such as the formation of inhibitors and the transmission of infections. Therefore, it is important to search for alternative methods to prevent bleeding complications. In routine practice antifibrinolytic medicine is often used before, during and after surgery. However, there is currently no clear scientific evidence for this practice. Search date The evidence is current to: 01 March 2019 Trial characteristics We did not find any trials of antifibrinolytic medicine to prevent bleeding after minor oral surgery or dental extractions in people with Von Willebrand disease. The review does include two trials published in the 1970s in 59 people with haemophilia undergoing dental extraction. In one trial the people were aged between 13 and 65 years and in the second trial the people had an average age of 34 years .  One trial lasted five days and used tranexamic acid; the second trial lasted 10 days and used epsilon aminocaproic acid tablets. Both trials compared the active medicine with a substance that contained no medication (a placebo) in addition to clotting factor concentrates. Key results Overall, the two included trials showed a reduction in the number of bleeds after dental extraction, in the amount of blood loss, and in the need for clotting factor concentrates in the people treated with tranexamic acid or epsilon aminocaproic acid tablets compared to those who received a placebo. When combining the results of both trials it appeared that antifibrinolytic medication roughly halves the bleeding rate after dental extraction and the trials reported. Side effects of the antifibrinolytic medicine rarely occurred and led to discontinuation of epsilon aminocaproic acid tablets in only one case. Quality of the evidence In the epsilon aminocaproic acid trial, the trial physicians assigned each person to receive a placebo or the active treatment based on a pair‐matching technique for age, factor‐assay and the number of extractions. The fact that the trial physicians made this decision may have introduced a selection bias. However, we do not think that this had a major impact on the trial's conclusions. Overall, the two trials were small and differed from each other in terms of how many of the people taking part had severe haemophilia, the simultaneous use of clotting factor concentrates and the different antifibrinolytic treatment schedules. We rated the overall quality of the evidence as low for using antifibrinolytic medicine to prevent bleeding in people with haemophilia after minor oral surgery or dental extractions. No evidence was found for people with Von Willebrand disease. It could however be argued that, if antifibrinolytic medicine works for people with haemophilia, it is likely that the medicine will also work for people with other bleeding disorders undergoing dental extractions or minor oral surgery.","4","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Antifibrinolytic Agents [*therapeutic use]; Hemophilia A [*complications, drug therapy]; Humans; Minor Surgical Procedures [adverse effects]; Oral Hemorrhage [*prevention & control]; Postoperative Hemorrhage [prevention & control]; Surgery, Oral; Tooth Extraction [adverse effects]; von Willebrand Diseases [*complications]","10.1002/14651858.CD011385.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011385.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

In order for young people to participate effectively in shared decision‐making they need to develop the skills of engagement with healthcare professionals and confidence in interacting with them. They also need to learn how to manage their condition and treatments on their own when they move into adulthood. Children and young people who participate in shared decision‐making in healthcare are likely to be more informed, feel more prepared, and experience less anxiety about the unknown. Significant improvements in cystic fibrosis (CF) survival over recent decades, due to improved therapies and better management of care, means that young people with CF are routinely transitioning to adult healthcare where increasing emphasis on self‐management brings greater complexity in decision‐making. We need to know what interventions are effective in promoting shared decision‐making for young people with CF. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions that promote participation in shared decision‐making for children and adolescents (aged between four and 18 years) with CF. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearches of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of articles and reviews addressing shared decision‐making. Date of most recent search: 12 March 2019. We searched PubMed, CINAHL (EBSCO), Embase (Elsevier), PsycINFO (EBSCO), WHO ICTRP, ASSIA (ProQuest), ERIC (ProQuest), ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted study authors with published relevant research in shared decision‐making for adults to ask if they were aware of any published or ongoing studies on the promotion of the intervention for children or adolescents (or both) with CF. Date of most recent search: 19 March 2019. Selection criteria We planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (but not cross‐over RCTs) of interventions promoting shared decision‐making for children and adolescents with CF aged between four and 18 years, such as information provision, booklets, two‐way interaction, checking understanding (by the participant), preparation to participate in a healthcare decision, decision‐aids, and training interventions or educational programs. We planned to include interventions aimed at children or adolescents (or both), parents or healthcare professionals or any combination of these groups provided that the focus was aimed at promoting shared decision‐making for children and adolescents with CF. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently reviewed papers identified in the searches. Main results No eligible RCTs were identified for inclusion in this systematic review. Authors' conclusions We were unable to identify RCTs with evidence which would support healthcare policy‐making and practice related to implementation of shared decision‐making for children and adolescents (aged between four and 18 years) with CF). We hope that having identified this gap in research, awareness will increase amongst researchers of the need to design high‐quality shared decision‐making interventions for young people with CF, perhaps adapted from existing models for adults, and to test these interventions and children's preferences in RCTs. It is also important to target health professionals with evidence‐based education programmes on shared decision‐making and a need for international consensus on addressing the variability in education programmes. Plain language summary Approaches for helping children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis to take part in decisions about their healthcare Review question We reviewed the evidence on ways to help children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis to take part in decisions about their healthcare. Background Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition mainly affecting the lungs and digestive system. In the lungs there is a build‐up of sticky mucus making infection more likely and damaging the airways. Sticky secretions from the pancreas block the flow of digestive juices into the gut, so that food is not digested or absorbed properly. Improvements in treatments mean that people with cystic fibrosis are living longer and long‐term management issues have become more relevant. In childhood there is a high burden of complicated treatments which then continues throughout life. Young people with cystic fibrosis need to be included in decisions about their healthcare, so that they can develop skills to manage their condition and assume responsibility for long‐term care. In shared decision‐making, a child or adolescent is actively included in healthcare decisions that affect them. We know from research with children that they want to be involved in healthcare decisions at a level of their choosing with the support of their parents and healthcare provider. We wanted to find out if there were any good techniques for encouraging children and young people with cystic fibrosis to take part in decisions about their healthcare and to identify any adverse effects. This review was funded by a Cochrane Fellowship awarded to the main author. Search date The evidence is current to: 19 March 2019. Study characteristics We planned to include studies where the people taking part would be put into groups at random. We wanted to compare approaches to shared decision‐making for children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis aged between four and 18 years. Examples of these would be providing information, checking the young person understood and was prepared to participate in decision‐making about their healthcare, the use of decision‐aids and training or educational programs. We planned to include approaches aimed at children and adolescents, at parents or at healthcare professionals (or any combination of these) where the focus was to promote shared decision‐making for children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis. Key results We did not find any studies that were eligible to include in the review. We think future research should aim to test models of shared decision‐making for young people with cystic fibrosis, which could be developed from existing models for adults; and also work out which methods young people prefer. It is also important to train health professionals in using shared decision‐making and make sure that training is consistent across all countries.","5","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Cystic Fibrosis; *Decision Making; *Patient Participation; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Humans; Self‐Management","10.1002/14651858.CD012578.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012578.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD001915.PUB6","Balfour-Lynn, IM; Welch, K; Smith, S","Inhaled corticosteroids for cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2019","Abstract - Background The reduction of lung inflammation is one of the goals of cystic fibrosis therapy. Inhaled corticosteroids are often used in this respect to treat children and adults with cystic fibrosis. The rationale for this is their potential to reduce lung damage arising from inflammation, as well as their effect on symptomatic wheezing. It is important to establish the current level of evidence for the risks and benefits of inhaled corticosteroids, especially in the light of their known adverse effects on growth. This is an update of a previously published review; however, due to the lack of research in this area, we do not envisage undertaking any further updates. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of taking regular inhaled corticosteroids compared to not taking them in children and adults with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We requested information from pharmaceutical companies manufacturing inhaled corticosteroids and authors of identified trials. Date of most recent search of the Group's Trials Register: 19 November 2018. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi‐randomised trials, published and unpublished, comparing inhaled corticosteroids to placebo or standard treatment in individuals with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Two independent authors assessed methodological quality and risk of bias in trials using established criteria and extracted data using standard pro formas. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE criteria. Main results The searches identified 35 citations, of which 27 (representing 13 trials) were eligible for inclusion. These 13 trials reported the use of inhaled corticosteroids in 525 people with cystic fibrosis aged between 6 and 55 years. One was a withdrawal trial in 171 individuals who were already taking inhaled corticosteroids. Methodological quality and risk of bias were difficult to assess from published information. Objective measures of airway function were reported in most trials but were often incomplete and reported at different time points. We found no difference in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) or forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted in any of the trials, although the quality of the evidence was low due to risks of bias within the included trials and low participant numbers. We are uncertain whether inhaled corticosteroids result in an improvement in exercise tolerance, bronchial hyperreactivity or exacerbations as the quality of the evidence was very low. Data from one trial suggested that inhaled corticosteroids may make little or no difference to quality of life (low‐quality evidence). Three trials reported adverse effects, but the quality of the evidence is low and so we are uncertain whether inhaled corticosteroids increase the risk of adverse effects. However, one study did show that growth was adversely affected by high doses of inhaled corticosteroids. Authors' conclusions Evidence from these trials is of low to very low quality and insufficient to establish whether inhaled corticosteroids are beneficial in cystic fibrosis, but withdrawal in those already taking them has been shown to be safe. There is some evidence they may cause harm in terms of growth. It has not been established whether long‐term use is beneficial in reducing lung inflammation, which should improve survival, but it is unlikely this will be proven conclusively in a randomised controlled trial. Plain language summary Inhaled corticosteroids for cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of inhaled corticosteroids in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Repeated chest infections in people with cystic fibrosis cause inflammation and damage to the lungs which, in the long term, is the most common reason for death. Inhaled corticosteroids are often used to treat inflammation, but may cause some side effects. Some of these side effects are less serious, e.g., oral thrush, but others are more serious, such as reduced growth rate in childhood. This is an update of a previously published review and due to a lack of research in this area, we do not plan any further updates. Search date The last search for evidence was on 19 November 2018. Study characteristics In this updated review, 13 trials reported the use of inhaled corticosteroids in 525 people with cystic fibrosis. In most of the trials participants started taking steroids or placebo (treatment that appeared the same as the steroids, but did not have any active medicine in it) at the start of the trial, but one trial was a withdrawal trial (171 participants), where everyone was already taking steroids and while half of them carried on, the rest took a placebo, in effect stopping the treatment. Participants were aged between 6 and 55 years; three of the trials were in children only, four in adults only and four were mixed ages; two trials did not describe the ages of the people taking part. The lung function and severity of disease of the participants varied across trials and only two trials gave information about their genetic mutations. All trials took place in Europe. In 10 of the trials, all those taking part remained in the same group up to the end of the trial (either a treatment group or a group receiving no treatment or a placebo), but in three trials they swapped groups halfway through the trial. The trials lasted between three weeks and two years. Key results The clinical trials have not been able to prove that inhaled corticosteroids reduce inflammation in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis. We found no difference in measurements of lung function, exercise tolerance, the reaction of airways to irritation or the number of exacerbations (flare up of symptoms). Generally, it was unclear if inhaled corticosteroids increased the risk of adverse effects, but one trial did show that these drugs can slow down children's growth when used in high doses. Furthermore, results from the withdrawal trial showed that under close supervision of the cystic fibrosis team, it may be safe for people who have been taking inhaled corticosteroids for some time to stop doing so. Quality of the evidence We thought the quality of the evidence was low to very low. A lack of information meant we were often not able to judge if the way the trials were designed or run could have affected our confidence in the results. Only three trials gave details of how they made sure people taking part had equal chances of being in the treatment or placebo groups; and only five described how they made sure the people recruiting participants did not know which groups they would be going into. In most cases, we did not think that once the trials started the people taking part or their doctors knew whether they were getting steroids or placebo. However, we did have some concerns that four of the trials had not been published in journals, who would have sent the reports to experts to check for accuracy and we were not sure how this might affect our confidence in the results.","7","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Administration, Inhalation; Adolescent; Adrenal Cortex Hormones [administration & dosage, adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Adult; Anti-Inflammatory Agents [administration & dosage, adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*drug therapy]; Forced Expiratory Volume [drug effects]; Humans; Middle Aged; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Vital Capacity; Young Adult","10.1002/14651858.CD001915.pub6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001915.pub6","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Although nociceptive pain is more common, at times, people with SCD may have neuropathic pain. The latter can occur due to peripheral or central nerve injury. This review is focused on identifying treatment of only painful sensory neuropathy in people with SCD. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and safety of any pharmacological or non‐pharmacological therapies for treating neuropathic pain in people with SCD. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched trial registries, the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews and contacted experts in the field. Date of last search: 31 January 2019. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (parallel or cross‐over in design), quasi‐RCTs of pharmacological or non‐pharmacological therapies for treating neuropathic pain in people with SCD compared to placebo or another intervention in any category (i.e. pharmacological or non‐pharmacological). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed all trials identified by the searches and extracted relevant data. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias in the selected trials using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Two review authors independently rated the quality of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE guidelines. Main results One RCT of 22 participants with SCD, conducted in the USA was included in this review. Participants were randomly assigned to either pregabalin (n = 11) or placebo (n = 11). Oral pregabalin was administered at an initial dose of 75 mg twice daily. The drug was titrated at increments of 75 mg to a maximum of 600 mg daily or decreased by 75 mg per day if necessary, based on clinical presentation and pain level. Neuropathic pain was assessed using self‐reports on the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (S‐LANNS) scale and the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI), where higher scores were indicative of more pain. Outcomes included self‐reported pain, quality of life and withdrawal due to adverse effects measured at baseline and monthly for three months post‐intervention. The overall risk of bias was low with a high risk of bias due to attrition. In relation to this reviews primary outcomes, for self‐reported neuropathic pain relief, given the paucity of data, we are very uncertain whether there is a difference between the pregabalin and placebo groups at the end of three months as measured by the S‐LANSS scale, mean difference (MD) ‐2.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐9.18 to 5.18), or the NPSI scale, MD ‐11.10 (95% CI ‐33.97 to 11.77) (very low‐quality evidence). There was no report of 'Patient Global Impression of Change' in the included trial. Although the mean quality of life scores (Short Form‐36) at three months showed small increases in seven of the eight domains post‐intervention in the pregabalin group as compared to the placebo group, this was very low‐quality evidence and we are very uncertain whether pregabalin increases quality of life. Neither of our pre‐defined outcomes of 'time to improvement of symptoms' or 'changes in sleep quality', were measured in the included trial. While treatment‐related adverse effects appeared higher in pregabalin group than the placebo group at three months, this was very low‐quality evidence and we are very uncertain whether there is a difference, RR 1.33 (95% CI 0.39 to 4.62) (very low‐quality evidence). There was one withdrawal for adverse effects in the pregabalin group while three people withdrew or dropped out from the placebo group due to adverse effects and complications and hospitalisation related to SCD. Authors' conclusions The included trial provided very low‐quality evidence. Self‐reported pain relief was greater in the pregabalin group compared to the placebo control group but only using the S‐LANSS scale and we are very unsure whether there is a difference. While the pregabalin group tended to have improved quality of life over the duration of the trial, this was very low‐quality evidence and we are uncertain whether there is a difference. Adverse effects and withdrawals were similar across the treatment and placebo control group in trial. There are both insufficient trials addressing this review question and insufficient outcomes addressed in the single included RCT. Therefore, there is still a significant gap in evidence on interventions for neuropathic pain in people with SCD. Plain language summary Treatments for neuropathic pain in persons with sickle cell disease Review question   We reviewed the evidence about the effect and safety of drug, or other therapies, for treating pain due to nerve damage (neuropathic pain) in people with sickle cell disease (SCD). Background Pain is the most common complication of SCD. Some of this pain may be due to damage to nerves and this pain needs to be treated differently from the usual sickle cell pain. The usual medications such as ibuprofen or morphine may not be effective in managing this nerve pain. This trial aimed to examine how safe and effective medications or other alternative treatments are for nerve pain in people with SCD. Search date   The evidence is current to: 31 January 2019. Study characteristics   After a detailed search of scientific literature, we identified one trial that was eligible for inclusion. In this trial people with SCD who were diagnosed to have neuropathic pain were randomly put into groups to take either a drug named pregabalin or a placebo (no active medication) treatment. Key results   The trial was conducted in the USA and included 22 participants with SCD, with 11 people in the pregabalin group and 11 in the placebo drug group. Assessments were measured at baseline and monthly for three months. Self‐reported neuropathic pain relief and quality of life scores (Short Form‐36) were no different between the pregabalin and placebo groups. The outcomes of time to improvement of symptoms and changes in sleep quality were not measured in the included trial. Few unwanted effects were noted and the numbers of these were not different between participants who were given pregabalin versus those given placebo. In conclusion, the effect of pregabalin on SCD neuropathic pain was no different to placebo. We are unable to make firm conclusions regarding our objectives on the basis of a single small trial which only addressed three of our seven prespecified outcomes. Larger, well‐conducted trials of different treatments for neuropathic pain in people with SCD need to be carried out. Quality of the evidence   The evidence in this review was assessed as very‐low quality. The single trial in this review lost more than 15% of participants to follow‐up over three months. We downgraded the level of evidence due to lack of clarity in how the participants were assigned to the pregabalin or the placebo group and due to the small number of events and participants in the trial.","7","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Analgesics [*therapeutic use]; Anemia, Sickle Cell [*complications]; Humans; Neuralgia [*drug therapy, *etiology]; Pregabalin [*therapeutic use]; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD012943.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012943.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD012267.PUB2","Ryan, A; Nevitt, SJ; Tuohy, O; Cook, P","Biomarkers for diagnosis of Wilson's disease","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2019","Abstract - Background Wilson's disease, first described by Samuel Wilson in 1912, is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder resulting from mutations in the  ATP7B  gene. The disease develops as a consequence of copper accumulating in affected tissues. There is no gold standard for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, which is often delayed due to the non‐specific clinical features and the need for a combination of clinical and laboratory tests for diagnosis. This delay may in turn affect clinical outcome and has implications for other family members in terms of diagnosis. The Leipzig criteria were established to help standardise diagnosis and management. However, it should be emphasised that these criteria date from 2003, and many of these have not been formally evaluated; this review examines the evidence behind biochemical testing for Wilson's disease. Objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of three biochemical tests at specified cut‐off levels for Wilson's disease. The index tests covered by this Cochrane Review are caeruloplasmin, 24‐hour urinary copper and hepatic copper content. These tests were evaluated in those with suspected Wilson's disease and appropriate controls (either healthy or those with chronic liver disease other than Wilson's). In the absence of a gold standard for diagnosing Wilson's disease, we have used the Leipzig criteria as a clinical reference standard. To investigate whether index tests should be performed in all individuals who have been recommended for testing for Wilson's disease, or whether these tests should be limited to subgroups of individuals. Search methods We identified studies by extensive searching of, e.g. the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, the Web of Science and clinical trial registries (29 May 2019). Date of the most recent search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Inborn Errors of Metabolism Register: 29 May 2019. Selection criteria We included prospective and retrospective cohort studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of an index test using the Leipzig criteria as a clinical reference standard for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently reviewed and extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of each included study using the QUADAS‐2 tool. We had planned to undertake meta‐analyses of the sensitivity, specificity at relevant cut‐offs for each of the biochemical tests for Wilson's, however, due to differences in the methods used for each biochemical index test, it was not possible to combine the results in meta‐analyses and hence these are described narratively. Main results Eight studies, involving 5699 participants (which included 1009 diagnosed with Wilson's disease) were eligible for inclusion in the review. Three studies involved children only, one adults only and the four remaining studies involved both children and adults. Two evaluated participants with hepatic signs and six with a combination of hepatic and neurological signs and symptoms of Wilson's disease, as well as pre‐symptomatic individuals. The studies were of variable methodological quality; with high risk if bias for participant selection and the reference standard used being of greatest methodological concern. Key differences between studies include differences in assay methodology, different cut‐off values for diagnostic thresholds, different age and ethnicity groups. Concerns around study design imply that diagnostic accuracy figures may not transfer to populations outside of the relevant study. Index test: caeruloplasmin Five studies evaluated various thresholds of caeruloplasmin (4281 participants, of which 541 had WD). For caeruloplasmin a cut‐off of 0.2 g/L as in the Leipzig criteria achieved a sensitivity of 77.1% to 99%, with variable specificity of 55.9% to 82.8%. Using the cut‐off of 0.1 g/L of the Leipzig criteria seemed to lower the sensitivity overall, 65% to 78.9%, while increasing the specificity to 96.6% to 100%. Index test: hepatic copper Four studies evaluated various thresholds of hepatic copper (1150 participants, of which 367 had WD). The hepatic copper cut‐off of 4 μmol/g used in the Leipzig criteria achieved a sensitivity of 65.7% to 94.4%, with a variable specificity of 52.2% to 98.6%. Index test: 24‐hour urinary copper Three studies evaluated various thresholds of 24‐hour urinary copper (268 participants, of which 101 had WD). For 24‐hour urinary copper, a cut‐off of 0.64 to 1.6 μmol/24 hours used in the Leipzig criteria achieved a variable sensitivity of 50.0% to 80.0%, with a specificity of 75.6% to 98.3%. Authors' conclusions The cut‐offs used for caeruloplasmin, 24‐hour urinary copper and hepatic copper for diagnosing Wilson's disease are method‐dependent and require validation in the population in which such index tests are going to be used. Binary cut‐offs and use of single‐test strategies to rule Wilson's disease in or out is not supported by the evidence in this review. There is insufficient evidence to inform testing in specific subgroups, defined by age, ethnicity or clinical subgroups. Plain language summary Laboratory blood, urine tests and liver biopsy used for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease in children and adults Why is improving Wilson's disease diagnosis important? Wilson's disease is an inherited disease that leads to a build‐up of copper in affected parts of the body. Diagnosis usually occurs in children or young adults, but has been seen in adults over 60 years of age. Copper build‐up begins in the liver progressing over time to affect the brain; however, the challenge for doctors is that liver disease in Wilson's disease has non‐specific features and standard liver blood tests may be normal, even with advanced scarring of the liver or cirrhosis. Early diagnosis allows earlier treatment, however, other causes of chronic liver disease may cause false‐positive results and, depending on cut‐off values used for testing, may result in further unnecessary testing. Conversely, false‐negative results may also arise when a single‐test strategy for diagnosis is used, possibly leading to a delay in treatment. What is the aim and what was included in this review? We aimed to examine the accuracy of three commonly used diagnostic tests to correctly identify Wilson's disease. These tests are: caeruloplasmin (a protein that carries copper in blood); copper in the urine; and copper in the liver. Initial evaluation usually involves checking an individual's eyes for signs of Wilson's disease and a blood test for caeruloplasmin, as this is the most widely accessible biochemical test for Wilson's disease. However, the pathway to diagnosing Wilson's disease is highly variable. Follow‐up testing depends on results of initial testing, plus the ability to access relevant tests and the likelihood with which the doctor believes the individual has Wilson's disease. What are the main results in the review? We found eight studies (5699 participants), of whom 1009 were diagnosed with Wilson's disease. One study assessed all three biochemical tests, three assessed caeruloplasmin, one assessed 24‐hour urinary copper, two assessed hepatic copper and one assessed both urine and hepatic copper. Four studies evaluated adults and children, three evaluated children and adolescents and one evaluated adults. The clinical presentation of Wilson's disease also varied: six studies evaluated individuals with both liver and neurological symptoms of Wilson's disease in addition to individuals who had not yet developed symptoms; and two studies evaluated individuals with liver symptoms only. The ability of the three tests evaluated to detect those with Wilson's disease (termed sensitivity) was variable (50% to 94.4%); the ability to detect those without disease (termed specificity) was also variable (52.2% to 98.3%). No single test was capable of diagnosing Wilson's disease in isolation. There was also not enough evidence to determine the accuracy of the tests within different age groups or Wilson's disease subgroups (e.g. those with liver or neurological symptoms). How reliable are the results of the studies in this review? Since there is no gold standard test for diagnosing Wilson's disease, we selected a clinical and laboratory standard (the Leipzig criteria) to determine the diagnosis of the disease. Results of this review suggest that part of the variability in test sensitivity and specificity at the cut‐offs in the Leipzig criteria is likely to be influenced by the method used to undertake the diagnostic tests. However, there were some problems with how the included studies were conducted. This may result in the caeruloplasmin, urine or liver copper appearing more accurate than it is, increasing the number of positive results (sensitivity). What are the implications of this review? Limited evidence from the included studies support the use of multiple‐index testing as outlined in the Leipzig criteria. The diagnostic thresholds used in this criteria will vary with laboratory test, with the method used to conduct the laboratory test, and with the individuals in the included studies (who varied by age, ethnicity and clinical presentation of disease). These factors should therefore be taken into account when interpreting the results. High sensitivity (true‐positive rate) for each of the laboratory tests is possible at particular cut‐off values; however, when used in isolation, each laboratory test may have a false‐positive or false‐negative rate. Limitations in study design may exaggerate test accuracy. How up‐to‐date is this review?

Those who are homozygous have severe disease. The average worldwide prevalence of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is at least 1 in 500, although recent genetic epidemiological data from Denmark and next generation sequencing data suggest the frequency may be closer to 1 in 250. Diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia in children is based on elevated total cholesterol and low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels or DNA‐based analysis, or both. Coronary atherosclerosis has been detected in men with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia as young as 17 years old and in women with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia at 25 years old. Since the clinical complications of atherosclerosis occur prematurely, especially in men, lifelong treatment, started in childhood, is needed to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. In children with the disease, diet was the cornerstone of treatment but the addition of lipid‐lowering medications has resulted in a significant improvement in treatment. Anion exchange resins, such as cholestyramine and colestipol, were found to be effective, but they are poorly tolerated. Since the 1990s studies carried out on children aged 6 to 17 years with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia have demonstrated significant reductions in their serum total and low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. While statins seem to be safe and well‐tolerated in children, their long‐term safety in this age group is not firmly established. This is an update of a previously published version of this Cochane Review. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of statins in children with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Search methods Relevant studies were identified from the Group's Inborn Errors and Metabolism Trials Register and Medline. Date of most recent search: 04 November 2019. Selection criteria Randomized and controlled clinical studies including participants up to 18 years old, comparing a statin to placebo or to diet alone. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. Main results We found 26 potentially eligible studies, of which we included nine randomized placebo‐controlled studies (1177 participants). In general, the intervention and follow‐up time was short (median 24 weeks; range from six weeks to two years). Statins reduced the mean low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration at all time points (high‐quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in liver function (serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferase, as well as creatinine kinase concentrations) between treated and placebo groups at any time point (low‐quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in myopathy (as measured in change in creatinine levels) (low‐quality evidence) or clinical adverse events (moderate‐quality evidence) with statins compared to placebo. One study on simvastatin showed that this may slightly improve flow‐mediated dilatation of the brachial artery (low‐quality evidence), and on pravastatin for two years may have induced a regression in carotid intima media thickness (low‐quality evidence). No studies reported rhabdomyolysis (degeneration of skeletal muscle tissue) or death due to rhabdomyolysis, quality of life or compliance to study medication. Authors' conclusions Statin treatment is an effective lipid‐lowering therapy in children with familial hypercholesterolemia. Few or no safety issues were identified. Statin treatment seems to be safe in the short term, but long‐term safety remains unknown. Children treated with statins should be carefully monitored and followed up by their pediatricians and their care transferred to an adult lipidologist once they reach 18 years of age. Large long‐term randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the long‐term safety issues of statins. Plain language summary Statins for children with inherited high blood cholesterol Review question We reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of statins in children with inherited high blood cholesterol. Background Familial hypercholesterolemia is an inherited disease in which the blood cholesterol level is high. Vascular disease, i.e. furring up of the blood vessels, often occurs at an earlier age than usual, especially amongst men. Thus lifelong therapies, started in childhood, to reduce blood cholesterol are needed. In children with familial hypercholesterolemia, diet has been the main treatment option. Medications, such as cholestyramine and colestipol, have been used effectively, but due to their unpleasant taste they are poorly tolerated and treatment plans are not followed. The advent of statin therapy for children has improved treatment and this review updates the previous published version. Search date The evidence is current to: 04 November 2019. Study characteristics The review included 9 studies with 1177 people with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia aged between 4 and 18 years of age. Studies compared different statin treatments with a substance which contains no medication (termed placebo) and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly. The studies lasted from 12 weeks to 104 weeks. Key results In general, the intervention and follow‐up time was short (median 24 weeks; range from six weeks to two years). Statins probably reduced the mean low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration at all time points (high‐quality evidence). The levels of the liver enzymes, serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferase, and the muscle enzyme, creatinine kinase, did not differ between treated and placebo groups at any time point (low‐quality evidence). The risks of myopathy (disease of muscle tissue) and side‐effects were very low and similar in both groups (low‐quality evidence). Two of the statins, simvastatin and pravastatin may have a positive effect on two of the major blood vessels typically affected by raised cholesterol levels (low‐quality evidence). Quality of the evidence Information regarding blinding (performance bias and detection bias), was available for all nine studies; each was described as double blind, indicating that participants and those participating in treatment procedures were blinded to treatment. In two studies information on how the participants were allocated to treatment groups (selection bias) was clearly presented, but this information was not clearly stated in the remaining seven studies. There is a lack of information whether investigators knew which treatment group participants would be put into (selection bias) and or whether selective reporting (reporting bias) occurred, but it is very unlikely. In conclusion, it can be stated all the studies appeared to be well run and we do not think any of the above‐mentioned factors influenced the results in a negative way. Quality of evidence varied from high (change in serum low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol) through moderate (adverse events) to low (change in blood vessel wall (carotid intima‐media) thickness, change in measures if growth and maturation, liver dysfunction, myopathy and change in blood wall (endothelial) function).","11","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Cholesterol, LDL [blood]; Female; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II [blood, *drug therapy, genetics]; Male; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Young Adult","10.1002/14651858.CD006401.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006401.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Supplementation of antioxidant micronutrients (vitamin E, vitamin C, beta‐carotene and selenium) or N‐acetylcysteine (NAC) as a source of glutathione, may therefore potentially help maintain an oxidant‐antioxidant balance. Glutathione or NAC can also be inhaled and if administered in this way can also have a mucolytic effect besides the antioxidant effect. Current literature suggests a relationship between oxidative status and lung function. This is an update of a previously published review.

We contacted authors of included studies and checked reference lists of these studies for additional, potentially relevant studies. We also searched online trials registries. Last search of Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 08 January 2019. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled studies comparing antioxidants as listed above (individually or in combination) in more than a single administration to placebo or standard care in people with CF. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. We contacted study investigators to obtain missing information. If meta‐analysed, studies were subgrouped according to supplement, method of administration and the duration of supplementation. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. Main results One quasi‐randomised and 19 randomised controlled studies (924 children and adults) were included; 16 studies (n = 639) analysed oral antioxidant supplementation and four analysed inhaled supplements (n = 285). Only one of the 20 included studies was judged to be free of bias. Oral supplements versus control The change from baseline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) % predicted at three months and six months was only reported for the comparison of NAC to control. Four studies (125 participants) reported at three months; we are uncertain whether NAC improved FEV 1  % predicted as the quality of the evidence was very low, mean difference (MD) 2.83% (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐2.16 to 7.83). However, at six months two studies (109 participants) showed that NAC probably increased FEV 1  % predicted from baseline (moderate‐quality evidence), MD 4.38% (95% CI 0.89 to 7.87). A study of a combined vitamin and selenium supplement (46 participants) reported a greater change from baseline in FEV 1  % predicted in the control group at two months, MD ‐4.30% (95% CI ‐5.64 to ‐2.96). One study (61 participants) found that NAC probably makes little or no difference in the change from baseline in quality of life (QoL) at six months (moderate‐quality evidence), standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.03 (95% CI ‐0.53 to 0.47), but the two‐month combined vitamin and selenium study reported a small difference in QoL in favour of the control group, SMD ‐0.66 (95% CI ‐1.26 to ‐0.07). The NAC study reported on the change from baseline in body mass index (BMI) (62 participants) and similarly found that NAC probably made no difference between groups (moderate‐quality evidence). One study (69 participants) found that a mixed vitamin and mineral supplement may lead to a slightly lower risk of pulmonary exacerbation at six months than a multivitamin supplement (low‐quality evidence). Nine studies (366 participants) provided information on adverse events, but did not find any clear and consistent evidence of differences between treatment or control groups with the quality of the evidence ranging from low to moderate. Studies of β‐carotene and vitamin E consistently reported greater plasma levels of the respective antioxidants. Inhaled supplements versus control Two studies (258 participants) showed inhaled glutathione probably improves FEV 1  % predicted at three months, MD 3.50% (95% CI 1.38 to 5.62), but not at six months compared to placebo, MD 2.30% (95% CI ‐0.12 to 4.71) (moderate‐quality evidence). The same studies additionally reported an improvement in FEV 1  L in the treated group compared to placebo at both three and six months. One study (153 participants) reported inhaled glutathione probably made little or no difference to the change in QoL from baseline, MD 0.80 (95% CI ‐1.63 to 3.23) (moderate‐quality evidence). No study reported on the change from baseline in BMI at six months, but one study (16 participants) reported at two months and a further study (105 participants) at 12 months; neither study found any difference at either time point. One study (153 participants) reported no difference in the time to the first pulmonary exacerbation at six months. Two studies (223 participants) reported treatment may make little or no difference in adverse events (low‐quality evidence), a further study (153 participants) reported that the number of serious adverse events were similar across groups. Authors' conclusions With regards to micronutrients, there does not appear to be a positive treatment effect of antioxidant micronutrients on clinical end‐points; however, oral supplementation with glutathione showed some benefit to lung function and nutritional status. Based on the available evidence, inhaled and oral glutathione appear to improve lung function, while oral administration decreases oxidative stress; however, due to the very intensive antibiotic treatment and other concurrent treatments that people with CF take, the beneficial effect of antioxidants remains difficult to assess in those with chronic infection without a very large population sample and a long‐term study period. Further studies, especially in very young children, using outcome measures such as lung clearance index and the bronchiectasis scores derived from chest scans, with improved focus on study design variables (such as dose levels and timing), and elucidating clear biological pathways by which oxidative stress is involved in CF, are necessary before a firm conclusion regarding effects of antioxidants supplementation can be drawn. The benefit of antioxidants in people with CF who receive CFTR modulators therapies should also be assessed in the future. Plain language summary How do vitamins E and C, beta‐carotene, selenium and glutathione affect lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis? Background Frequent chest infections cause long‐term lung inflammation; inflammation‐causing cells produce an oxygen molecule (reactive oxygen species (ROS)), which may harm body tissue (oxidative damage); the body uses antioxidants to protect itself. People with cystic fibrosis (CF) have high levels of ROS compared to low levels of antioxidants. Antioxidant supplements might reduce oxidative damage and build up levels of antioxidants. Given difficulties in absorbing fat, people with CF have low levels of fat‐soluble antioxidants (vitamin E and beta‐carotene). Water‐soluble vitamin C decreases with age in people with CF. Glutathione, one of the most abundant antioxidants in cells, is not released properly into the lungs of people with CF. Some enzymes that help antioxidants work depend on the mineral selenium, so selenium supplements aim to stimulate antioxidant action. Most supplements are swallowed, but glutathione and N‐acetylcysteine (NAC) (which the body uses to make glutathione) can also be inhaled; these may affect lung function as antioxidants, but also due to thinning mucus when inhaled (allowing easier mucus clearance). Search date Last search for this updated review: 08 January 2019. Study characteristics We included 20 studies (924 people with CF, almost equal gender split, aged six months to 59 years); 16 studies compared oral supplements to placebo ('dummy' treatment) and four compared inhaled supplements to placebo. Key results Oral supplements We are uncertain whether NAC changes lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) % predicted) at three months (four studies, 125 participants, very low‐quality evidence), but at six months two studies (109 participants) reported NAC probably improved FEV 1  % predicted (moderate‐quality evidence). One study (46 participants) reported a greater change in FEV 1  % predicted with placebo than with a combined vitamin and selenium supplement after two months. One study (61 participants) reported little or no difference in quality of life (QoL) scores between NAC and control after six months (moderate‐quality evidence), but the two‐month combined vitamin and selenium study reported slightly better QoL scores in the control group. NAC probably made no difference to body mass index (BMI) (one study, 62 participants, moderate‐quality evidence). One study (69 participants) reported that a mixed vitamin and mineral supplement may lead to a lower risk of pulmonary exacerbation at six months than a multivitamin supplement (low‐quality evidence). Nine studies (366 participants) did not find any clear and consistent differences in side effects between groups (evidence ranged from low to moderate quality). Vitamin E and β‐carotene studies consistently reported greater levels of these antioxidants in blood samples. Inhaled supplements In two studies (258 participants), inhaled glutathione probably improved FEV 1  % predicted compared to placebo at three months but not at six months (moderate‐quality evidence); these studies also reported a greater improvement in FEV 1  litres with glutathione compared to placebo at both time points. Two studies (258 participants) found little or no difference in the change in QoL scores (moderate‐quality evidence). One two‐month study (16 participants) and a 12‐month study (105 participants) reported no difference between groups in the change in BMI. There was no difference in the time to the first pulmonary exacerbation in one six‐month study. Two studies (223 participants) reported no difference between groups in side effects (low‐quality evidence) and another study (153 participants) reported that the number of serious side effects were similar across groups. Conclusions Vitamin and mineral supplements do not seem to improve clinical outcomes. Inhaled glutathione appears to improve lung function, while oral administration lowers oxidative stress, with benefits to lung function and nutritional measures. Intensive antibiotic and other concurrent treatments for people with CF and chronic infection mean it is difficult to assess the effect of antioxidants without a very large and long study. Future research should look at how antioxidants affect people with CF taking CFTR modulator therapies. Quality of the evidence Evidence ranged from very low to moderate quality. All but one study had some bias; mostly because data were not fully reported (likely to affect our results). We were also largely unsure if participants knew which treatment they received, both in advance and once the studies started (unsure how this might affect our results).","10","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Administration, Inhalation; Administration, Oral; Adult; Antioxidants [*therapeutic use]; Ascorbic Acid [therapeutic use]; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*drug therapy]; Humans; Micronutrients [*therapeutic use]; Oxidative Stress; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Selenium [therapeutic use]; Vitamin E [therapeutic use]; Vitamins [therapeutic use]","10.1002/14651858.CD007020.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007020.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

There is no standardized approach to antibiotic therapy and treatment is likely to vary from country to country. Thus, there is a need to identify the efficacy and safety of different antibiotic treatment approaches for people with sickle cell disease suffering from osteomyelitis. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives To determine whether an empirical antibiotic treatment approach (monotherapy or combination therapy) is effective and safe as compared to pathogen‐directed antibiotic treatment and whether this effectiveness and safety is dependent on different treatment regimens, age or setting. Search methods We searched The Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched the LILACS database (1982 to 20 October 2016), African Index Medicus (20 October 2016), ISI Web of Knowledge (20 October 2016) and clinical trials registries (19 September 2019).

Data collection and analysis Each author intended to independently extract data and assess trial quality by standard Cochrane methodologies, but no eligible randomised controlled trials were identified. Main results This update was unable to find any randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials on antibiotic treatment approaches for osteomyelitis in people with sickle cell disease. Authors' conclusions We were unable to identify any relevant trials on the efficacy and safety of the antibiotic treatment approaches for people with sickle cell disease suffering from osteomyelitis. Randomised controlled trials are needed to establish the optimum antibiotic treatment for this condition, however, we do not envisage further trials of this intervention will be conducted, and hence the review will no longer be regularly updated. Plain language summary Antibiotics for treating osteomyelitis in people with sickle cell disease Review question We reviewed the evidence to determine whether antibiotics (alone or in combination) given to people with sickle cell disease who have osteomyelitis (a bone infection) before the specific bacterium causing an infection is known is effective and safe as compared to bacterium‐directed antibiotic treatment and whether this effectiveness and safety is dependent on different treatment regimens, age or setting. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Background Sickle cell disease affects millions of people throughout the world. Osteomyelitis is one of the major complications. Antibiotics are given to treat it, but there is no worldwide standard treatment. Search date The evidence is current to: 18 September 2019.

"CD003147.PUB5","McIlwaine, M; Button, B; Nevitt, SJ","Positive expiratory pressure physiotherapy for airway clearance in people with cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2019","Abstract - Background Chest physiotherapy is widely prescribed to assist the clearance of airway secretions in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Positive expiratory pressure (PEP) devices provide back pressure to the airways during expiration. This may improve clearance by building up gas behind mucus via collateral ventilation and by temporarily increasing functional residual capacity. The developers of the PEP technique recommend using PEP with a mask in order to avoid air leaks via the upper airways and mouth. In addition, increasing forced residual capacity (FRC) has not been demonstrated using mouthpiece PEP. Given the widespread use of PEP devices, there is a need to determine the evidence for their effect. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and acceptability of PEP devices compared to other forms of physiotherapy as a means of improving mucus clearance and other outcomes in people with CF. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. The electronic database CINAHL was also searched from 1982 to 2017. Most recent search of the Group's CF Trials Register: 20 February 2019. Selection criteria Randomised controlled studies in which PEP was compared with any other form of physiotherapy in people with CF. This included, postural drainage and percussion (PDPV), active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT), oscillating PEP devices, thoracic oscillating devices, bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPaP) and exercise. Data collection and analysis Three authors independently applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria to publications, assessed the risk of bias of the included studies and assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE recommendations. Main results A total of 28 studies (involving 788 children and adults) were included in the review; 18 studies involving 296 participants were cross‐over in design. Data were not published in sufficient detail in most of these studies to perform any meta‐analysis. In 22 of the 28 studies the PEP technique was performed using a mask, in three of the studies a mouthpiece was used with nose clips and in three studies it was unclear whether a mask or mouthpiece was used. These studies compared PEP to ACBT, autogenic drainage (AD), oral oscillating PEP devices, high‐frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) and BiPaP and exercise. Forced expiratory volume in one second was the review's primary outcome and the most frequently reported outcome in the studies (24 studies, 716 participants). Single interventions or series of treatments that continued for up to three months demonstrated little or no difference in effect between PEP and other methods of airway clearance on this outcome (low‐ to moderate‐quality evidence). However, long‐term studies had equivocal or conflicting results regarding the effect on this outcome (low‐ to moderate‐quality evidence). A second primary outcome was the number of respiratory exacerbations. There was a lower exacerbation rate in participants using PEP compared to other techniques when used with a mask for at least one year (five studies, 232 participants; moderate‐ to high‐quality evidence). In one of the included studies which used PEP with a mouthpiece, it was reported (personal communication) that there was no difference in the number of respiratory exacerbations (66 participants, low‐quality evidence). Participant preference was reported in 10 studies; and in all studies with an intervention period of at least one month, this was in favour of PEP. The results for the remaining outcome measures (including our third primary outcome of mucus clearance) were not examined or reported in sufficient detail to provide any high‐quality evidence; only very low‐ to moderate‐quality evidence was available for other outcomes. There was limited evidence reported on adverse events; these were measured in five studies, two of which found no events. In a study where infants performing either PEP or PDPV experienced some gastro‐oesophageal reflux , this was more severe in the PDPV group (26 infants, low‐quality evidence). In PEP versus oscillating PEP, adverse events were only reported in the flutter group (five participants complained of dizziness, which improved after further instructions on device use was provided) (22 participants, low‐quality evidence). In PEP versus HFCWO, from one long‐term high‐quality study (107 participants) there was little or no difference in terms of number of adverse events; however, those in the PEP group had fewer adverse events related to the lower airways when compared to HFCWO (high‐certainty evidence). Many studies had a risk of bias as they did not report how the randomisation sequence was either generated or concealed. Most studies reported the number of dropouts and also reported on all planned outcome measures. Authors' conclusions The evidence provided by this review is of variable quality, but suggests that all techniques and devices described may have a place in the clinical treatment of people with CF. Following meta‐analyses of the effects of PEP versus other airway clearance techniques on lung function and patient preference, this Cochrane Review demonstrated that there was high‐quality evidence that showed a significant reduction in pulmonary exacerbations when PEP using a mask was compared with HFCWO. It is important to note that airway clearance techniques should be individualised throughout life according to developmental stages, patient preferences, pulmonary symptoms and lung function. This also applies as conditions vary between baseline function and pulmonary exacerbations. Plain language summary Using positive expiratory pressure physiotherapy to clear the airways of people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence on the effect of positive expiratory pressure (PEP) physiotherapy to clear the airways of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Background CF affects approximately one in 3000 live births in white populations and causes frequent lung infection, due to mucus blocking the airways. Chest physiotherapy is often used to try to clear the mucus from the lungs. We wanted to discover whether using a PEP device (a form of chest physiotherapy) was better or worse than other other forms of chest physiotherapy for clearing the mucus from the lungs in people with CF. A PEP device provides positive pressure behind the mucus to try to push it out of the lungs. This is an update of a previously published review. Search date The evidence is current to 20 February 2019. Study characteristics The review includes 28 studies with 788 people (from infants to adults) with CF with mild to severe lung disease. The studies compared PEP to other methods of chest physiotherapy; the length of treatment ranged from a single session to two years of treatment. Key results Generally, the efficacy of PEP is similar to other methods of chest physiotherapy such as postural drainage with percussion, active cycle of breathing techniques, autogenic drainage, oscillatory PEP devices such as the flutter and acapella, thoracic oscillating devices such as the 'Vest', and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPaP) (typically used for ventilatory support, but by changing the inspiratory and expiratory pressures on the device and combining it with huffing, BiPaP has been used for airway clearance). We found no difference between PEP and other forms of chest physiotherapy in lung function, the amount of mucus cleared from the airways or its related effects on the health of people with CF. However, the rate of flare ups of respiratory symptoms decreased in people using PEP compared to other forms of physiotherapy such as a vibrating PEP device or a vibrating vest. There was some evidence that people with CF may prefer PEP to other chest physiotherapy methods. There was no evidence of PEP causing harm, except in one study where infants performing either PEP or percussion in various positions which use gravity to help drain secretions, experienced some gastro‐oesophageal reflux (regurgitation of food) in head‐down positions; this was more severe in the group using postural drainage with percussion. In all the other trials PEP was performed in a sitting position. In 10 of the 28 studies studied single PEP treatment sessions. The results from these studies are very limited as they could not report on the number of respiratory infections and lung function did not change with just one treatment. Two one‐year studies compared PEP to postural drainage and percussion; in the study with children, PEP improved their lung function, while in the adult study, lung function declined slightly with both PEP and postural drainage and percussion. Also, the method of performing PEP was different in the two age groups. Although PEP seems to have an advantage in reducing flare ups (based on the combined results of a few studies), different physiotherapy techniques and devices may be more or less effective at varying times and in different individuals during baseline function and chest flare ups. Each person should talk to their clinician to help choose which method of airway clearance is best for them and which they will adhere to, so as to provide the best quality of life and long‐term outcomes. Quality of the evidence Some studies were of low quality. These studies highlight the difficulty in comparing studies using PEP compared to other forms of chest physiotherapy. Factors such as age and severity of lung disease in the participants may affect the results as well as the method of performing each treatment. Overall, the evidence provided by this review for whether PEP reduces flare ups compared to other forms of chest physiotherapy was moderate to high quality, but evidence for other outcomes was of very low to moderate quality, as results were limited.","11","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Cystic Fibrosis [complications, *therapy]; Drainage, Postural [methods]; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Mucociliary Clearance; Mucus [metabolism]; Physical Therapy Modalities; Positive‐Pressure Respiration [*methods]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Therapy [*methods]","10.1002/14651858.CD003147.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003147.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen) may prevent progressive pulmonary deterioration and morbidity in cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of treatment with oral non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs in cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, hand searches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We contacted manufacturers of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs and searched online trials registries. Latest search of the Group's Trials Register: 21 November 2018. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials comparing oral non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, at any dose for at least two months, to placebo in people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion the review and their potential risk of bias. Two authors independently rated the quality of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE guidelines. Main results The searches identified 17 trials; four are included (287 participants aged five to 39 years; maximum follow‐up of four years) and one is currently awaiting classification pending publication of the full trial report and two are ongoing. Three trials compared ibuprofen to placebo (two from the same center with some of the same participants); one trial assessed piroxicam versus placebo. The three ibuprofen trials were deemed to have good or adequate methodological quality, but used various outcomes and summary measures. Reviewers considered measures of lung function, nutritional status, radiological assessment of pulmonary involvement, intravenous antibiotic usage, hospital admissions, survival and adverse effects. Combined data from the two largest ibuprofen trials showed a lower annual rate of decline for lung function, % predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ), mean difference (MD) 1.32 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 2.42) (moderate‐quality evidence); forced vital capacity (FVC), MD 1.27 (95% CI 0.26 to 2.28) (moderate‐quality evidence); forced expiratory flow (FEF 25%‐75% ), MD 1.80 (95% CI 0.15 to 3.45). The post hoc analysis of data from two trials split by age showed a slower rate of annual decline of FEV 1  % predicted and FVC in the ibuprofen group in younger children, MD 1.41% (95% CI 0.03 to 2.80) (moderate‐quality evidence) and MD 1.32% (95% CI 0.04 to 2.60) (moderate‐quality evidence) respectively. Data from four trials demonstrated the proportion of participants with at least one hospitalization may be slightly lower in the ibuprofen group compared to placebo, Peto odds ratio 0.61 (95% CI 0.37 to 1.01) (moderate‐quality evidence). In one trial, long‐term use of high‐dose ibuprofen was associated with reduced intravenous antibiotic usage, improved nutritional and radiological pulmonary status. No major adverse effects were reported, but the power of the trials to identify clinically important differences in the incidence of adverse effects was low. We did not have any concerns with regards to risk of bias for the trial comparing piroxicam to placebo. However, the trial did not report many data in a form that we could analyze in this review. No data were available for the review's primary outcome of lung function; available data for hospital admissions showed no difference between the groups. No analyzable data were available for any other review outcome. Authors' conclusions High‐dose ibuprofen can slow the progression of lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis, especially in children, which suggests that strategies to modulate lung inflammation can be beneficial for people with cystic fibrosis. Plain language summary Treatment with oral drugs other than steroids to reduce lung inflammation and deterioration in lung function in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed evidence to see if drugs that were not steroids could reduce inflammation in the lungs and stop lung function getting worse in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Inflammation in the lungs increases the damage done to them and is the most common reason for early death in people with cystic fibrosis. In high doses, non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, particularly ibuprofen, may work against inflammation, but in low doses there is some evidence that they may cause the inflammation. The use of high doses has also raised concerns about the potential for unwanted effects, which has limited the use of these drugs in cystic fibrosis. Search date The evidence is current to: 21 November 2018. Study characteristics We looked for trials comparing oral non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs to a a placebo (a tablet that contained no active medicine). We looked for any dose level. but the trial had to run for at least two months in people with cystic fibrosis. We found 17 trials and included four of these with a total of 287 people aged five to 39 years; one further trial has not yet been published in full and two are still ongoing; we will assess these when we have more information. Three of the four included trials compared ibuprofen to a placebo; two of these trials were run in the same center and used some of the same people. One trial compared a drug called piroxicam to placebo. The longest trial lasted four years. We aimed to report on lung function, nutritional status, lung x‐rays, how often intravenous antibiotics were needed, details about hospital admissions, survival and side effects. Key results We combined results from the two largest ibuprofen trials and showed that those taking ibuprofen had a lower annual rate of decline in lung function which was consistent across three lung function measurements. We then looked at these results split by age (even though we did not originally plan to do this) and found that two of the measurements showed a slower rate of annual decline in lung function in younger children. Results from four trials showed that fewer participants in the ibuprofen group were admitted to hospital at least once compared to placebo, although it was not clear if the difference was just chance or not. In one trial, people taking a long‐term high dose of ibuprofen were less likely to need intravenous antibiotics, had better nutritional status and healthier lungs as seen by X‐ray. No major side effects were reported in the trials, but they had not been designed to show differences in the rates of side effects. To summarize, we found evidence showing that a high dose of a non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drug, most notably ibuprofen, may slow the progression of lung damage in people with cystic fibrosis, especially in younger people. The long‐term safety results are limited but we feel that there is enough evidence to suggest that non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs be temporarily stopped when people with cystic fibrosis are receiving intravenous aminoglycosides or other drugs that may badly damage the kidneys. The trial of the drug piroxicam did not report many results in a form that we could analyse in the review. We did not have any results for our main outcome of lung function. The only results we had reported no difference between the piroxicam group and the placebo group for the number of hospital admissions. Quality of the evidence We judged the evidence to be of moderate quality overall. We thought the three ibuprofen trials had a good or adequate level of methodological quality with little risk of bias to the results, but used a range of different outcomes and summary measures. We did not have any concerns with regards to risks of bias for the trial comparing piroxicam to placebo.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Administration, Oral; Adolescent; Adult; Anti‐Inflammatory Agents, Non‐Steroidal [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*drug therapy]; Female; Humans; Ibuprofen [administration & dosage, therapeutic use]; Male; Piroxicam [administration & dosage, therapeutic use]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Young Adult","10.1002/14651858.CD001505.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001505.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD010517.PUB3","Sharma, A; Easow Mathew, M; Puri, L","Splenectomy for people with thalassaemia major or intermedia","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2019","Abstract - Background Thalassaemia is a genetic disorder of the haemoglobin protein in red blood cells. It has been historically classified into thalassaemia minor, intermedia and major, depending on the genetic defect and severity of the disease. The clinical presentation of β‐thalassaemia varies widely from a mild asymptomatic form in thalassaemia minor, to a severe disease in thalassaemia major where individuals are dependant on life‐long blood transfusions. The hallmark of thalassaemia syndromes is the production of defective red blood cells that are removed by the spleen resulting in an enlarged hyperfunctioning spleen (splenomegaly). Removal of the spleen may thus prolong red blood cell survival by reducing the amount of red blood cells removed from circulation and may ultimately result in the reduced need for blood transfusions. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of splenectomy in people with β‐thalassaemia major or intermedia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Review Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from searches of electronic databases and the handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched online trial registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews (27 July 2018). Date of the most recent search of the Group's trials register: 02 August 2019. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled and quasi‐randomised controlled studies of people of any age with thalassaemia major or intermedia, evaluating splenectomy in comparison to conservative treatment (transfusion therapy and iron chelation) or other forms of splenectomy compared to each other (laparoscopic, open, radio‐frequency). Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected and extracted data from the single included study using a customised data extraction form and assessed the risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Main results One study, including 28 participants was included in the review; the results were described, primarily, in a narrative manner. This study assessed the feasibility of splenectomy using a laparoscopic approach versus open surgery. Given the lack of detail regarding the study methods beyond randomisation, the overall risk of bias for this study was unclear. The study was carried out over a period of 3.5 years, with each participant followed up only until discharge (less than one week after the intervention); it did not assess the majority of the outcomes outlined in this review (including two of the three primary outcomes, frequency of transfusion and quality of life). A total of three serious post‐operative adverse events (the review's third primary outcome) were reported in the laparoscopic splenectomy group (one case of atelectasis and two cases of bleeding), compared to two events of atelectasis in the open surgery group; however, there were no significant differences between the groups for either atelectasis, risk ratio (RR) 0.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 4.90) or for bleeding, RR 5.00 (95% CI 0.26 to 95.61) (very low‐quality evidence). In addition, the study also reported three serious cases of intra‐operative bleeding in the laparoscopic group which mandated conversion to open surgery, although the difference between groups was not statistically significant, RR 7.00 (95% CI 0.39 to 124.14) (very low‐quality evidence). These effect estimates are based on very small numbers and hence are unreliable and imprecise. From this small study, there appeared to be an advantage for the laparoscopic approach, in terms of post‐operative hospital stay, although the group difference was not large (median difference of 1.5 days, P = 0.03). Authors' conclusions The review was unable to find good quality evidence, in the form of randomised controlled studies, regarding the efficacy of splenectomy for treating thalassaemia major or intermedia. The single included study provided little information about the efficacy of splenectomy, and compared open surgery and laparoscopic methods. Further studies need to evaluate the long‐term effectiveness of splenectomy and the comparative advantages of surgical methods. Due to a lack of high quality evidence from randomised controlled studies, well‐conducted observational studies may be used to answer this question. Plain language summary Removal of the spleen in people with thalassaemia major and intermedia Review question We reviewed the evidence comparing the removal of the spleen (splenectomy) to other treatments (such as blood transfusions and chelation (removal of excess iron) in people with thalassaemia major and intermedia. Background Thalassaemia is a genetic disease, caused by a defect in production of haemoglobin ‐ which carries oxygen in red blood cells to all the tissues of the body. The clinical presentation of thalassaemia varies widely from a mild asymptomatic form to being dependant on life long blood transfusions. The genetic defect in thalassaemia also results in formation of ineffective red blood cells, which are removed by the spleen which in turn becomes enlarged. Removing the spleen can lengthen the lifespan of red blood cells and reduce the need for transfusions. We wanted to evaluate whether current evidence showed that removing the spleen was safe and effective in the long term and compare different surgical methods of removing the spleen. Search date The evidence is current to: 02 August 2019. Study characteristics One study with a total of 28 participant was included in the review. This study compared two methods of splenectomy ‐ laparoscopic (keyhole) versus an open surgical approach. Study participants were recruited over a period of 3.5 years, but participants were only followed up to the end of their hospital stay (usually less than one week). Key results The study evaluated the two types of surgical methods. Only one of our three primary outcomes were reported, the number of people experiencing major adverse events (bleeding during and after the operation and complete or partial collapse of a lung). However, the amount of information available is not sufficient to draw any reliable conclusions (very‐low quality evidence). Hence, we were unable to provide recommendations regarding the use of splenectomy in people with thalassaemia. Appropriate clinical judgement, in view of the various risks and benefits described by other lower quality sources of evidence (e.g. observational studies), may be necessary when considering splenectomy in people with thalassaemia. Quality of the evidence While we are satisfied that the participants had equal chances of undergoing either type of surgery, there is not enough information on other aspects of the study to make any overall judgement on its quality.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Laparoscopy; Blood Transfusion; Humans; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Splenectomy [*methods]; beta‐Thalassemia [*surgery]","10.1002/14651858.CD010517.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010517.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD012949.PUB2","Coffey, MJ; Garg, M; Homaira, N; Jaffe, A; Ooi, CY","Probiotics for people with cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2020","Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem disease and the importance of growth and nutrition has been well established, given its implications for lung function and overall survival. It has been established that intestinal dysbiosis (i.e. microbial imbalance) and inflammation is present in people with CF. Probiotics are commercially available (over‐the‐counter) and may improve both intestinal and overall health. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics for improving health outcomes in children and adults with CF. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of last register search: 20 January 2020. We also searched ongoing trials registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 29 January 2019. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing efficacies and safety of probiotics in children and adults with CF. Cross‐over RCTs with a washout phase were included and for those without a washout period, only the first phase of each trial was analysed. Data collection and analysis We independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included trials; we used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We contacted trial authors for additional data. Meta‐analyses were undertaken on outcomes at several time points. Main results We identified 17 trials and included 12 RCTs (11 completed and one trial protocol ‐ this trial was terminated early) (464 participants). Eight trials included only children, whilst four trials included both children and adults. Trial duration ranged from one to 12 months. Nine trials compared a probiotic (seven single strain and three multistrain preparations) with a placebo preparation, two trials compared a synbiotic (multistrain) with a placebo preparation and one trial compared two probiotic preparations. Overall we judged the risk of bias in the 12 trials to be low. Three trials had a high risk of performance bias, two trials a high risk of attrition bias and six trials a high risk of reporting bias. Only two trials were judged to have low or unclear risk of bias for all domains. Four trials were sponsored by grants only, two trials by industry only, two trials by both grants and industry and three trials had an unknown funding source. Combined data from four trials (225 participants) suggested probiotics may reduce the number of pulmonary exacerbations during a four to 12 month time‐frame, mean difference (MD) ‐0.32 episodes per participant (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.68 to 0.03; P = 0.07) (low‐certainty evidence); however, the 95% CI includes the possibility of both an increased and a reduced number of exacerbations. Additionally, two trials (127 participants) found no evidence of an effect on the duration of antibiotic therapy during the same time period. Combined data from four trials (177 participants) demonstrated probiotics may reduce faecal calprotectin, MD ‐47.4 µg/g (95% CI ‐93.28 to ‐1.54; P = 0.04) (low‐certainty evidence), but the results for other biomarkers mainly did not show any difference between probiotics and placebo. Two trials (91 participants) found no evidence of effect on height, weight or body mass index (low‐certainty evidence). Combined data from five trials (284 participants) suggested there was no difference in lung function (forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV 1 ) % predicted) during a three‐ to 12‐month time frame, MD 1.36% (95% CI ‐1.20 to 3.91; P = 0.30) (low‐certainty evidence). Combined data from two trials (115 participants) suggested there was no difference in hospitalisation rates during a three‐ to 12‐month time frame, MD ‐0.44 admissions per participant (95% CI ‐1.41 to 0.54; P = 0.38) (low‐certainty evidence). One trial (37 participants) reported health‐related quality of life and while the parent report favoured probiotics, SMD 0.87 (95% CI 0.19 to 1.55) the child self‐report did not identify any effect, SMD 0.59 (95% CI ‐0.07 to 1.26) (low‐certainty evidence). There were limited results for gastrointestinal symptoms and intestinal microbial profile which were not analysable. Only four trials and one trial protocol (298 participants) reported adverse events as a priori hypotheses. No trials reported any deaths. One terminated trial (12 participants and available as a protocol only) reported a severe allergic reaction (severe urticaria) for one participant in the probiotic group. Two trials reported a single adverse event each (vomiting in one child and diarrhoea in one child). The estimated number needed to harm for any adverse reaction (serious or not) is 52 people (low‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions Probiotics significantly reduce faecal calprotectin (a marker of intestinal inflammation) in children and adults with CF, however the clinical implications of this require further investigation. Probiotics may make little or no difference to pulmonary exacerbation rates, however, further evidence is required before firm conclusions can be made. Probiotics are associated with a small number of adverse events including vomiting, diarrhoea and allergic reactions. In children and adults with CF, probiotics may be considered by patients and their healthcare providers. Given the variability of probiotic composition and dosage, further adequately‐powered multicentre RCTs of at least 12 months duration are required to best assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics for children and adults with CF. Plain language summary Probiotics for people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence for the use of probiotics in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Cystic fibrosis leads to thick mucus which affects the lungs, gut and other organs. People with cystic fibrosis often have altered gut bacteria and inflammation. Gut inflammation may be linked to growth, with worse inflammation linked to worse growth measures. This is relevant as optimal nutrition and growth is important for lung function and survival in CF. Probiotics are live bacteria which will provide a health benefit to the individual. Probiotics are available over‐the‐counter, commonly used by people with cystic fibrosis and may improve gut inflammation and overall health. Search date The evidence is current to: 20 January 2020. Study characteristics The review included 12 randomised controlled trials (11 completed and one trial protocol (plan) ‐ this trial was terminated early but reported some results on side effects) with 464 people with cystic fibrosis. Eight trials included only children, whilst four trials included both children and adults. The trials lasted between one and 12 months. Eight trials used a probiotic with a single type of bacteria and four trials used a probiotic with two or more types of bacteria. Only one trial compared different bacteria and the others compared probiotics to a placebo (dummy treatment with no active medication). Key results Probiotics may reduce the rate of pulmonary exacerbations, however, this is not definite; pulmonary exacerbations are events where breathing symptoms are worsened (e.g. increased cough, sputum or shortness of breath) and lung function declines. Probiotics may reduce a marker of gut inflammation called calprotectin, however, the benefit of this to an individual is unknown. There were no differences between probiotics and placebo for height, weight or body mass index (BMI). Results did not show that probiotics affect lung function, need for admission to hospital or abdominal symptoms. One small trial measured quality of life and the parents questionnaire favoured probiotics, but the children's self report did not show a difference between probiotics and placebo. Probiotics may cause vomiting, diarrhoea and allergic reactions. We estimate 52 people need to take probiotics for one person to have an adverse event. We could not analyse the results of the trial comparing different probiotics because of its design. Future trials should look into the use of probiotics for at least 12 months and assess measures of lung and gut health, growth, abdominal symptoms, quality of life and adverse events. Given the wide range or probiotics (single and multi‐strain combinations), doses used and degree of effectiveness, determining the best regimen(s) to investigate further will be challenging. Certainty of the evidence There were several issues with the overall certainty of the evidence which affects our confidence in the results from these trials. We think the fact that some participants did not complete their treatment or were not included in the reports may affect the results on weight. We think the fact that not all planned outcomes were reported in four trials may affect the results of intestinal inflammation, growth and abdominal symptoms. We think the fact that the pharmaceutical industry sponsored at least four of the trials should be considered when looking at the results of this review. As most trials only included children we are not certain that the results would also apply to adults and there were also some issues related to whether people taking part in the trial knew which treatment they were receiving. We judged the certainty of evidence for changes in pulmonary exacerbations, intestinal inflammation, lung function, hospital admissions, weight and health‐related quality of life to be low. Adverse events were only recorded by four trials and the protocol for the terminated trial and the certainty of the evidence was also judged to be low.","1","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Cystic Fibrosis [complications, *microbiology, *therapy]; Humans; Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex [*analysis]; Probiotics [*therapeutic use]; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Treatment Outcome","10.1002/14651858.CD012949.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012949.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives To determine whether the timing of hypertonic saline inhalation (in relation to airway clearance techniques or in relation to time of day) has an impact on its clinical efficacy in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We identified relevant randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials from the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), and international cystic fibrosis conference proceedings. Date of the last search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 28 February 2019. Selection criteria Any trial of hypertonic saline in people with cystic fibrosis where timing of inhalation was the randomised element in the study protocol with either: inhalation up to six hours before airway clearance techniques compared to inhalation during airway clearance techniques compared to inhalation up to six hours after airway clearance techniques; or morning compared to evening inhalation with any definition provided by the author. Data collection and analysis Both authors independently assessed the trials identified by the search for potential inclusion in the review. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Main results The searches identified 104 trial reports which represented 51 trials, of which three cross‐over trials (providing data on 77 participants) met our inclusion criteria. We present three comparisons: inhalation before versus during airway clearance techniques; inhalation before versus after airway clearance techniques; and inhalation during versus after airway clearance techniques. One trial (50 participants), given its three‐arm design, was eligible for all three comparisons. No trials compared morning versus evening inhalation of hypertonic saline. The evidence from the three trials was judged to be of low quality downgraded for limitations (high risk of bias due to blinding) and indirectness (all participants are adults, and therefore not applicable to children). Intervention periods ranged from one treatment to three treatments in one day. There were no clinically important differences between the timing regimens of inhaling hypertonic saline before, during or after airway clearance techniques in the mean amount of improvement in lung function or symptom scores (77 participants), with the between‐group comparisons being non‐significant (low‐certainty evidence). While there may be little or no difference in the rating of satisfaction when hypertonic saline was inhaled before versus during the airway clearance techniques (64 participants) (with the 95% confidence interval including the possibility of both a higher and lower rating of satisfaction), satisfaction may be lower on a 100‐mm scale when inhaled after the airway clearance techniques compared to before: mean difference (MD) 20.38 mm (95% confidence interval (CI) 12.10 to 28.66) and when compared to during the techniques, MD 14.80 mm (95% CI 5.70 to 23.90). Perceived effectiveness showed similar results: little or no difference for inhalation before versus during airway clearance techniques (64 participants); may be lower when inhaled after the airway clearance techniques compared to before, MD 10.62 (95% CI 2.54 to 18.70); and also when compared to during the techniques, MD 15.60 (95% CI 7.55 to 23.65). There were no quality of life or adverse events reported in any of the trials. Authors' conclusions Timing of hypertonic saline inhalation makes little or no difference to lung function (low‐certainty evidence). However, inhaling hypertonic saline before or during airway clearance techniques may maximise perceived efficacy and satisfaction. The long‐term efficacy of hypertonic saline has only been established for twice‐daily inhalations; however, if only one dose per day is tolerated, the time of day at which it is inhaled could be based on convenience or tolerability until evidence comparing these regimens is available. The identified trials were all of very short intervention periods, so longer‐term research could be conducted to establish the effects arising from regular use, which would incorporate the influence of changes in adherence with long‐term use, as well as generating data on any adverse effects that occur with long‐term use. Plain language summary The timing of inhalation of hypertonic saline in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about whether the timing (in relation to airway clearance techniques or in relation to time of day) of hypertonic saline (a strong, sterile, salt water solution) through a nebuliser improves the physical properties of sputum, stimulates cough, improves clinical outcomes (such as lung function), and improves the perceived effect of airway clearance techniques in cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Background Regular inhalation of hypertonic saline improves the clinical outcomes of people with cystic fibrosis. It is not certain whether it is better to inhale hypertonic saline before, during or after clearing the airways with physical techniques, nor whether it is better to inhale it in the morning or in the evening. We looked for trials that compared these different timing regimens. Search date The evidence is current to: 28 February 2019. Study characteristics The review included three studies with 77 people with cystic fibrosis aged between 18 and 64 years of age .  The studies looked at the impact of the timing of hypertonic saline inhalation in relation to airway clearance techniques. The studies reported immediate outcomes after inhalation of hypertonic saline before, during or after physical airway clearance techniques. All studies were short, involving only one to three treatments of each timing regimen. Key results While outcomes such as lung function did not show any difference between the regimens, people with cystic fibrosis perceived that inhaling hypertonic saline before or during airway clearance techniques may be more effective and satisfying than inhaling hypertonic saline after airway clearance. No studies comparing morning and evening inhalation were found. The long‐term efficacy of hypertonic saline has only been established for twice‐daily inhalations; however, if only one dose per day is tolerated, the time of day at which it is inhaled could be based on convenience or tolerability until further evidence is available. Quality of the evidence Overall, the quality of the evidence was low. The only issues perhaps affecting the quality related to the fact that it was not possible for participants to be blinded to the treatment they received. However, because the studies were short‐term and most of the significant results were based on perceived efficacy, timing of administration of hypertonic saline needs further study.","2","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Mucociliary Clearance; Administration, Inhalation; Cystic Fibrosis [*drug therapy]; Drug Administration Schedule; Humans; Saline Solution, Hypertonic [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]; Sputum [metabolism]","10.1002/14651858.CD008816.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008816.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD011633.PUB3","Mulimani, P; Ballas, SK; Abas, ABL; Karanth, L","Treatment of dental complications in sickle cell disease","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2019","Abstract - Background Sickle cell disease is the most common single gene disorder and the commonest haemoglobinopathy found with high prevalence in many populations across the world. Management of dental complications in people with sickle cell disease requires special consideration for three main reasons. Firstly, dental and oral tissues are affected by the blood disorder resulting in several oro‐facial abnormalities. Secondly, living with a haemoglobinopathy and coping with its associated serious consequences may result in individuals neglecting their oral health care. Finally, the treatment of these oral complications must be adapted to the systemic condition and special needs of these individuals, in order not to exacerbate or deteriorate their general health. Guidelines for the treatment of dental complications in this population who require special care are unclear and even unavailable in many aspects. Hence this review was undertaken to provide a basis for clinical care by investigating and analysing the existing evidence in the literature for the treatment of dental complications in people with sickle cell disease. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To assess methods of treating dental complications in people with sickle cell disease. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Review Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of last search: 01 August 2019. Additionally, we searched nine online databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Literature in the Health Sciences in Latin America and the Caribbean database, African Index Medicus, Index Medicus for South East Asia Region, Index Medicus for the Eastern Mediterranean Region, Indexing of Indian Medical Journals). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews and contacted haematologists, experts in fields of dentistry, organizations, pharmaceutical companies and researchers working in this field. Date of last search: 07 November 2019. Selection criteria We searched for published or unpublished randomised controlled studies of treatments for dental complications in people with sickle cell disease. Data collection and analysis Two review authors intended to independently extract data and assess the risk of bias of the included studies using standard Cochrane methodologies; however, no studies were identified for inclusion in the review. Main results No randomised controlled studies were identified. Authors' conclusions This Cochrane Review did not identify any randomised controlled studies assessing interventions for the treatment of dental complications in people with sickle cell disease. There is an important need for randomised controlled studies in this area, so as to identify the most effective and safe method for treating dental complications in people with sickle cell disease. Plain language summary Treatment of dental complications in sickle cell disease Review question We planned to review the evidence regarding the treatment of dental complications in people with sickle cell disease. Background Sickle cell disease is a blood disorder which affects at least 5.2% of the world population across a large number of countries. In this condition, a genetic defect means that the haemoglobin in the red blood cells is not normal, instead the blood cells become sickle‐shaped and not a normal disc shape. These cells become trapped in blood vessels of various organs, especially during stressful events like a lack of oxygen, dehydration, extreme temperatures, stress, menstruation and infection. Blocked blood vessels lead to sudden episodes of severe pain in the short term and chronic organ damage in the long term. Sickle cell disease also leads to changes and complications in the mouth, jaw and facial areas. Management of these dental complications is often neglected as people with sickle cell disease focus all their energy on maintaining their general health due to the serious blood disorder. Neglecting minor dental health issues under these circumstances not only worsens the problem but may also cause a painful sickle‐cell crisis, leading to emergency hospital admissions. Treatment of oral complications in this group of people needs to be tailored around their blood disorder, in order not to cause any further deterioration to their general health. There is a lack of information on the appropriate treatment for dental complications in people with sickle cell disease,with no clear guidelines available. This often results in many people being refused treatment by dentists due to a fear of complications. Hence, we planned to investigate this issue and make any evidence in this area available to healthcare providers and people with the disease. Search date The evidence is current to: 01 August 2019. Study characteristics We were not able to find any randomised controlled studies assessing treatment for any dental complications in people with sickle cell disease. Key results   No studies were identified, so we can not draw any conclusions or highlight any implications for practice. Studies are needed to establish the best treatment for dental problems in people with sickle cell disease.    Quality of the evidence There is no evidence from studies (where people are given one treatment or another completely at random) for any treatment for dental complications in people with sickle cell disease.","12","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Anemia, Sickle Cell [*complications]; Craniofacial Abnormalities [complications]; Dental Care [*methods]; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Tooth Diseases [*etiology, therapy]","10.1002/14651858.CD011633.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011633.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Eradication of early PA infection is possible, but can recur in many individuals. We sought to examine strategies to delay the time to PA recurrence in people with CF. Objectives To establish whether secondary prevention strategies, using antibiotics or other therapies, increase the chances of people with CF remaining free from PA infection following successful eradication therapy. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched ongoing trials registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 21 August 2019. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (and quasi‐randomised trials where the risk of bias was low) comparing any treatment modality aimed at preventing recurrence of PA infection with placebo, standard therapy or any other treatment modality in people with CF who have undergone successful eradication of PA. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias. Quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Conflicts were resolved by discussion and the opinion of a third review author was sought where necessary. Only a subset of participants in the included trial were eligible, therefore individual participant data were requested and obtained from the trial investigators. Main results We included one trial (n = 306) in the review; however, only 253 participants had undergone successful eradication of PA, so fulfilling the inclusion criteria for our review. Information presented relates only to the included subset of participants. The trial recruited children aged one to 12 years (mean (standard deviation (SD)) age of 5.8 (3.5) years), 129 participants (51.0%) were female and the median follow‐up was 494 days. We compared cycled therapy with tobramycin inhalation solution (TIS), in which participants underwent 28 days of TIS every three months, with culture‐based therapy, in which participants were only prescribed medication when a quarterly sputum sample was positive for PA. Reasons for downgrading the quality of the evidence included applicability (only included children), incomplete outcome data and a small number of participants. The time to next isolation of PA was probably shorter with cycled TIS therapy than with culture‐based therapy, hazard ratio (HR) 2.04 days (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 3.26) (moderate‐quality evidence). This is in contrast to the main publication of the only included trial, which examined rate of PA positivity rather than time to PA infection and included participants not eligible for inclusion in this review. At the end of the trial, there was no difference between the cycled and culture‐based groups in the change from baseline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) L, mean difference (MD) 0.0 L (95% CI ‐0.09 to 0.09) or in FEV 1  % predicted, MD 0.70% (95% CI ‐4.33 to 5.73) (both very low‐quality evidence). There was no difference in the change from baseline for FVC between the groups. There was also no difference in the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations between groups, MD ‐0.18 (95% CI ‐0.51 to 0.14) (moderate‐quality evidence). Similarly, there was no difference between groups in the risk of participants developing novel resistant bacteria, RR 1.00 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.5) (moderate‐quality evidence). There were more severe adverse events in the cycled group, but the type of treatment probably makes little or no difference to the results, RR 0.65 (95% CI 0.39 to 1.11) (moderate‐quality evidence). There was no difference between groups in the change in weight or height from baseline or in rates of adherence to tobramycin or all trial medicines. The included trial did not assess changes in quality of life, the time to chronic infection with PA or the cost‐effectiveness of treatment. Authors' conclusions Cycled TIS therapy may be beneficial in prolonging the time to recurrence of PA after successful eradication, but further trials are required, specifically addressing this question and in both adults and children. Plain language summary Treatments for preventing recurrence of infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed evidence about the effect of treatments given to people with cystic fibrosis (CF) to prevent recurrence of infection with bacteria called  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  (PA) after it has been successfully treated. Background People with CF experience frequent, severe chest infections. These infections may be caused by bacteria that do not cause disease in healthy people, such as PA. PA is an important infection in CF since if it is not treated early it cannot be cleared from the lungs (termed chronic PA). When it cannot be cleared from the lungs, it causes ongoing damage to the lung tissue as well as worse chest infections. People with CF who have chronic PA may be more unwell than those without it. Early treatment can remove PA from the lungs of people with CF, but infection can happen again and is difficult to prevent. We want to know if giving extra treatment after the PA has been successfully treated, can prolong the time to the next infection. The treatment could be antibiotics or another treatment, for example something that helps the person's immune system fight the PA. Search date The evidence is current to: 21 August 2019. Trial characteristics We included one trial with 306 participants. Only 253 of these people had had successful treatment of PA and so could be included in our review. There were only children in the trial who were aged between one and 12 years old; 51% were girls. The trial compared treatment with one month of an inhaled antibiotic every three months ('cycled treatment') with antibiotic treatment given only when the person was found to have PA ('culture‐based treatment'). People were selected randomly to have either cycled or culture‐based treatment. The trial followed people up for an average of 70 weeks. Key results Taking into the account the certainty of the evidence, we believe that the time to the next isolation of PA was probably shorter with cycled therapy than with culture‐based therapy. We found that PA recurred in a quarter of participants in the culture‐based group by 249 days but in the cycled group it took 505 days; giving cycled treatment doubled the time to a new infection with PA compared with culture‐based treatment. This is in contrast to the main publication of the only included trial, which looked at the rate of positive PA cultures rather than the time to a new infection of PA and included participants not eligible for inclusion in this review. There was no difference between the groups in: pulmonary function (a measure of how well someone's lungs are working); in the number of people having chest infections; in the change in height and weight from the beginning to th end of the trial; in how many people took all the doses of the medications; in how many people developed infections with new bacteria; or in how many people had a serious complication. The trial did not give information about the effect of the two treatments on individuals' quality of life, the time until the development of chronic PA or the cost‐effectiveness of the treatment. Quality of the evidence The quality of most of the evidence was moderate. As the trial only included children, we cannot be sure if the cycled treatment would have the same effect in teenagers or adults with CF.

"CD009249.PUB5","Amin, R; Jahnke, N; Waters, V","Antibiotic treatment for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in people with cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2020","Abstract - Background Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  is one of the most common emerging multi‐drug resistant organisms found in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis and its prevalence is increasing. Chronic infection with  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  has recently been shown to be an independent predictor of pulmonary exacerbation requiring hospitalization and antibiotics. However, the role of antibiotic treatment of  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  infection in people with cystic fibrosis is still unclear. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives The objective of our review is to assess the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment for  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  in people with cystic fibrosis. The primary objective is to assess this in relation to lung function and pulmonary exacerbations in the setting of acute pulmonary exacerbations. The secondary objective is to assess this in relation to the eradication of  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia . Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched a registry of ongoing trials and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of latest search: 03 March 2020. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials of  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  mono‐infection or  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  co‐infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in either the setting of an acute pulmonary exacerbation or a chronic infection treated with suppressive antibiotic therapy. Data collection and analysis Both authors independently assessed the trials identified by the search for potential inclusion in the review. Main results We identified only one trial of antibiotic treatment of pulmonary exacerbations that included people with cystic fibrosis with  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia . However, this trial had to be excluded because data was not available per pathogen. Authors' conclusions This review did not identify any evidence regarding the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment for  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  in people with cystic fibrosis. Until such evidence becomes available, clinicians need to use their clinical judgement as to whether or not to treat  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  infection in people with cystic fibrosis. Randomized clinical trials are needed to address these unanswered clinical questions. Plain language summary Antibiotic treatment for  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of antibiotics in people with cystic fibrosis who were infected with  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia . Background Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  is a bacterium which is resistant to several antibiotics and over the last 10 years it has been found more and more often in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis. Long‐term infection with  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  has been linked to lung infections. However, at present, it is unclear if people with cystic fibrosis should be treated for this lung infection when it is identified. The purpose of this review is to determine whether treatment with different antibiotic combinations for  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  will improve lung function or decrease the frequency of hospital admission in people with cystic fibrosis. We also want to review the effect of treatment of long‐term  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  infection so as to remove it totally from the lungs of a person with cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published review. Search date The evidence is current to: 03 March 2020. Trial characteristics We did not find any randomized controlled trials (trials where the people taking part are put into different treatment groups completely at random) which we could include in the review. We did find one trial of antibiotic treatment for pulmonary exacerbations (flare up of disease in the airways) which included people infected with  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia , but the people in the trial also had infections caused by other bacteria and we were not able to obtain separate data for the different causes of infection. Key results Randomized controlled trials are needed to inform clinicians as to whether they should treat  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia  infection in people with cystic fibrosis. In the meantime, clinicians should use their clinical judgement when considering this question.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; Anti-Bacterial Agents [*therapeutic use]; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications, microbiology]; Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections [*drug therapy, microbiology]; Humans; Respiratory Tract Infections [*drug therapy, microbiology]","10.1002/14651858.CD009249.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009249.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Several psychosocial issues are potentially relevant in the clinical management of hemophilia, including it being a chronic and incurable condition; e.g. people with hemophilia must adapt to optimally interact with peers and to practice sports ‐ even choosing a sport represents an issue for perceived limitations, expectations and cultural influences on the individual and their family. People with hemophilia can react by denying their condition and its manifestations and not adhering to treatment. Due to the complexity of relationships surrounding genetic diseases, parents and relatives may have their own issues that contribute to making life easier or more difficult for the person with hemophilia. Anxiety, sadness and depression resulting in mental health disorders are reported in this population and may influence quality of life (QoL) depending on cultural background, religious beliefs, family support and other variables. Objectives Primarily to assess the effectiveness of psychological therapies for improving the ability of people with hemophilia to cope with their chronic condition. Search methods We aimed to identify trials from the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register, Embase and PsycINFO, CINAHL, MEDLINE and trial registries. We searched reference lists of included publications. Most recent search of the Group's register: 13 June 2019. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs in people with hemophilia of any age or gender, type A or B, any severity, with or without inhibitors, with or without HIV or hepatitis C virus. All psychological interventions for promoting emotional, intellectual and spiritual wellness. Individual, group or family group therapy interventions were eligible. Data collection and analysis We independently assessed trials, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias and assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. Main results Seven trials were included (362 participants randomized, data from 264 participants available for analysis); six of parallel design and one a partial cross‐over design. One multicenter trial was conducted in Canada; the remaining six were single centre undertaken in the UK, USA, Iran and in the Netherlands. All trials had a high risk of bias for participant blinding and use of patient‐reported outcomes. Evidence was retrieved on four interventions: psycho‐education (DVD plus information booklet versus information booklet alone; computerised learning versus no intervention); cognitive therapy (auto‐hypnosis (self‐hypnosis) versus control); and behavioural therapy (relaxation (progressive or self control) versus no treatment). We also aimed to assess psychodynamic therapy and systemic therapy, but no trials were identified. Heterogeneity of the outcome measures and measurements precluded meta‐analyses. No trial reported the cost of the psychological intervention and family adjustment. DVD plus information booklet compared to information booklet alone One trial (108 participants) showed coping strategies may lower pre‐contemplation scores and negative thoughts, mean difference (MD) ‐0.24 (95%CI ‐0.48 ‐ 0.00, low‐certainty evidence), however, other measures of coping strategies in the same trial suggest little or no difference between groups, e.g. contemplation, MD (‐0.09, 95%CI ‐0.32 – 0.14, low‐certainty evidence). The same trial measured QoL and showed little or no difference between treatment groups for the physical domain, MD 0.59 (95% CI ‐3.66 to 4.84, low‐certainty evidence), but may improve scores in the mental health domain for those receiving the booklet plus DVD compared to booklet alone, MD (4.70, 95% CI 0.33 to 9.07, low‐certainty evidence). Mood or personal well‐being were not reported. Computerised learning compared to no intervention Two trials (57 participants) reported on interventions aimed at children and adolescents and their impact on promoting a sense of self‐efficacy (primary outcome 'Mood and personal well‐being'), but only one showed an increase, MD 7.46 (95%CI 3.21 to 11.71, 17 participants, very low‐certainty evidence); the second did not report control group data. One trial (30 participants) showed the intervention did not improve self‐efficacy in adults, but appropriate data could not be extracted. Two trials (47 participants) reported coping strategies; one only reported within‐group differences from baseline, the second showed an increase from baseline in coping strategies in the Internet program group compared to the no intervention group (disease‐specific knowledge, MD 2.45 (95% CI 0.89 to 4.01); self‐management ability and transition readiness, MD 19.90 (95% CI 3.61 to 36.19; low‐certainty evidence). One trial reported QoL but with insufficient information to calculate changes from baseline; no difference in post‐treatment scores was seen between groups, MD ‐8.65, 95% CI ‐18.30 to 1.00, very low‐certainty evidence). Auto‐hypnosis (self‐hypnosis) compared to control There were two older trials that reported on this intervention (50 participants) focusing mainly on the secondary outcome 'physical health'; only one trial reported the primary outcome ‘mood and personal well‐being’ (only within‐group differences in the treatment group). Coping strategies and QoL were not assessed in the trials. Relaxation (progressive or self control) compared to no treatment Only one trial (seven participants) from 1985, was included which focused on 'physical health' and did not report on any of our primary outcomes. Authors' conclusions Not all of the seven included trials analysed the effects of the interventions on our primary outcomes (mood and personal well‐being, coping strategies and QoL). Three trials were conducted in the 1970s and 1980s using techniques of auto‐hypnosis or relaxation and, in accordance with the needs and therapeutic possibilities of the time, they focused on secondary outcomes, e.g. frequency of bleeding (physical health) and adherence to the intervention. The four newer trials assessed psycho‐educational interventions all mediated by the use of technologies (DVD or computer) and often created according to age needs of the target group. In these cases, attention was shifted to our pre‐defined primary outcomes. This review has identified low‐ and very low‐certainty evidence, prompting caution in its interpretation. The major problem we encountered was the heterogeneity of trial designs, of interventions and of outcome measures used across the trials. We strongly suggest that researchers consider developing a core outcome set to streamline future research; randomization was proven to be safe and acceptable, and blinding should be considered for those assessing patient‐reported outcomes. Plain language summary Psychological interventions for people living with hemophilia Review question Do psychological interventions improve the quality of life in people with hemophilia? Background Hemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder. Affected individuals bleed in their joints, and, if untreated, develop crippling joint damage occurring from recurrent joint bleeds. Depending on treatment availability, people living with hemophilia may or may not be able to enjoy a 'normal' or fulfilling life, and often present limitations in the range of physical activity, sports participation, family‐life planning and undertaking education and work attainment. Psychological interventions are often claimed to be important in order to minimise the impact of hemophilia and its affect on the quality of life of individuals living with the condition. Search date The evidence is current to 13 June 2019. Study characteristics We included trials comparing people with hemophilia receiving any psychological intervention compared with other individuals receiving a different intervention or no intervention at all. We found seven trials with 362 people with hemophilia aged between 6 and 65 years of age .  Trials compared either a DVD plus information booklet or computerised learning or auto‐hypnosis (self‐hypnosis) or relaxation techniques to no treatment and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly. The trials lasted from one to six months. Key results All treatments were safe, no major side effects were reported. Psycho‐educational interventions in children and adolescents seemed to promote a sense of self‐efficacy and better self‐management skills, but the quality of the evidence suggests that more rigorous experimental design is required. One trial in adults did not show any effect. Self‐hypnosis and relaxation techniques were not tested for the primary outcome but were useful in decreasing the number and severity of joint bleeds when drug treatment was not available. The effects of these interventions on quality of life vary. The major problem we encountered in this review is the difference in trial designs, interventions and outcome measures used across the trials. We strongly suggest that researchers in the field consider developing a core outcome set to streamline future research. Randomization was proven to be safe and acceptable in this research field, and blinding of outcome assessors should be considered in the presence of patient‐reported outcomes. Quality of the evidence The overall quality of the evidence was low to very low.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Adaptation, Psychological; *Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Anxiety [etiology, *therapy]; Chronic Disease; Depression [etiology, *therapy]; Hemophilia A [*psychology]; Humans; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD010215.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010215.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD012517.PUB2","Ng, SM; Stepien, KM; Krishan, A","Glucocorticoid replacement regimens for treating congenital adrenal hyperplasia","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2020","Abstract - Background Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is an autosomal recessive condition which leads to glucocorticoid deficiency and is the most common cause of adrenal insufficiency in children. In over 90% of cases, 21‐hydroxylase enzyme deficiency is found which is caused by mutations in the 21‐hydroxylase gene. Managing individuals with CAH due to 21‐hydroxylase deficiency involves replacing glucocorticoids with oral glucocorticoids (including prednisolone and hydrocortisone), suppressing adrenocorticotrophic hormones and replacing mineralocorticoids to prevent salt wasting. During childhood, the main aims of treatment are to prevent adrenal crises and to achieve normal stature, optimal adult height and to undergo normal puberty. In adults, treatment aims to prevent adrenal crises, ensure normal fertility and to avoid the long‐term consequences of glucocorticoid use. Current glucocorticoid treatment regimens can not optimally replicate the normal physiological cortisol level and over‐treatment or under‐treatment is often reported. Objectives To compare and determine the efficacy and safety of different glucocorticoid replacement regimens in the treatment of CAH due to 21‐hydroxylase deficiency in children and adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews, and trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP). Date of last search of trials register: 24 June 2019. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs comparing different glucocorticoid replacement regimens for treating CAH due to 21‐hydroxylase deficiency in children and adults. Data collection and analysis The authors independently extracted and analysed the data from different interventions. They undertook the comparisons separately and used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. Main results Searches identified 1729 records with 43 records subject to further examination. After screening, we included five RCTs (six references) with a total of 101 participants and identified a further six ongoing RCTs. The number of participants in each trial varied from six to 44, with participants' ages ranging from 3.6 months to 21 years. Four trials were of cross‐over design and one was of parallel design. Duration of treatment ranged from two weeks to six months per treatment arm with an overall follow‐up between six and 12 months for all trials. Overall, we judged the quality of the trials to be at moderate to high risk of bias; with lack of methodological detail leading to unclear or high risk of bias judgements across many of the domains. All trials employed an oral glucocorticoid replacement therapy, but with different daily schedules and dose levels. Three trials compared different dose schedules of hydrocortisone (HC), one three‐arm trial compared HC to prednisolone (PD) and dexamethasone (DXA) and one trial compared HC with fludrocortisone to PD with fludrocortisone. Due to the heterogeneity of the trials and the limited amount of evidence, we were unable to perform any meta‐analyses. No trials reported on quality of life, prevention of adrenal crisis, presence of osteopenia, presence of testicular or ovarian adrenal rest tumours, subfertility or final adult height. Five trials (101 participants) reported androgen normalisation but using different measurements (very low‐quality evidence for all measurements). Five trials reported 17 hydroxyprogesterone (17 OHP) levels, four trials reported androstenedione, three trials reported testosterone and one trial reported dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS). After four weeks, results from one trial (15 participants) showed a high morning dose of HC or a high evening dose made little or no difference in 17 OHP, testosterone, androstenedione and DHEAS. One trial (27 participants) found that HC and DXA treatment suppressed 17 OHP and androstenedione more than PD treatment after six weeks and a further trial (eight participants) reported no difference in 17 OHP between the five different dosing schedules of HC at between four and six weeks. One trial (44 participants) comparing HC and PD found no differences in the values of 17 OHP, androstenedione and testosterone at one year. One trial (26 participants) of HC versus HC plus fludrocortisone found that at six months 17 OHP and androstenedione levels were more suppressed on HC alone, but there were no differences noted in testosterone levels. While no trials reported on absolute final adult height, we reported some surrogate markers. Three trials reported on growth and bone maturation and two trials reported on height velocity. One trial found height velocity was reduced at six months in 26 participants given once daily HC 25 mg/m²/day compared to once daily HC 15 mg/m²/day (both groups also received fludrocortisone 0.1 mg/day), but as the quality of the evidence was very low we are unsure whether the variation in HC dose caused the difference. There were no differences noted in growth hormone or IGF1 levels. The results from another trial (44 participants) indicate no difference in growth velocity between HC and PD at one year (very low‐quality evidence), but this trial did report that once daily PD treatment may lead to better control of bone maturation compared to HC in prepubertal children and that the absolute change in bone age/chronological age ratio was higher in the HC group compared to the PD group. Authors' conclusions There are currently limited trials comparing the efficacy and safety of different glucocorticoid replacement regimens for treating 21‐hydroxylase deficiency CAH in children and adults and we were unable to draw any firm conclusions based on the evidence that was presented in the included trials. No trials included long‐term outcomes such as quality of life, prevention of adrenal crisis, presence of osteopenia, presence of testicular or ovarian adrenal rest tumours, subfertility and final adult height. There were no trials examining a modified‐release formulation of HC or use of 24‐hour circadian continuous subcutaneous infusion of hydrocortisone. As a consequence, uncertainty remains about the most effective form of glucocorticoid replacement therapy in CAH for children and adults. Future trials should include both children and adults with CAH. A longer duration of follow‐up is required to monitor biochemical and clinical outcomes. Plain language summary Glucocorticoid replacement regimens in the treatment of 21‐hydroxylase deficiency congenital adrenal hyperplasia Review question Steroid replacement therapy is used for treating congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21‐hydroxylase deficiency in children and adults; we looked at the evidence for how well different regimens work and how safe they are. Background CAH is a genetic disorder of the adrenal glands that affects the body's general health, growth, and development. Adrenal glands sit above the kidneys and are responsible for making the hormones cortisol and aldosterone. Cortisol helps to regulate blood sugar and blood pressure; and aldosterone is needed to control the salt concentration in the blood. The most common form of CAH is 21‐hydroxylase deficiency (more than 90% of cases). In a child with this type of CAH, the adrenal glands can not make enough cortisol and aldosterone. The glands overwork trying to make these hormones and end up making too many androgens (steroid hormones which regulate the development and maintenance of male characteristics in a person). Steroid medicines similar to cortisol are used to replace cortisol, and fludrocortisone (hormones that are similar to aldosterone) are the usual treatment for CAH due to 21‐hydroxylase deficiency. There are many different schedules and formulations of steroid replacement therapies, e.g. daily, twice‐daily, three‐times daily, more than three‐times daily medications, modified‐release formulation of hydrocortisone or using a 24‐hour circadian continuous infusion of hydrocortisone under the skin. We wanted to know which is more effective in treating 21‐hydroxylase deficiency CAH in children and adults. Search date The evidence is current to: 24 June 2019. Trial characteristics The review included five trials (six references) comparing different steroid replacement regimens in 101 people with 21‐hydroxylase deficiency CAH. The number of people in each trial varied from six to 44 and they ranged in age from 3.6 months to 21 years. We also found six studies that are still ongoing. Key results All trials used an oral therapy, but with different daily schedules and dose levels of steroids. Three trials compared different dose schedules of hydrocortisone, one trial compared hydrocortisone to prednisolone and dexamethasone and one trial compared hydrocortisone with fludrocortisone to prednisolone with fludrocortisone. We found no trials using a modified‐release formulation of hydrocortisone or a continuous 24‐hour delivery under the skin of hydrocortisone. Five trials reported androgen normalisation but using different measurements; none of these results showed any consistent and real difference between therapies. In one trial (26 participants) participants taking a higher dose of hydrocortisone reported a higher growth rate, but we are not sure whether this was directly due to the treatment. In a second trial (44 participants) comparing hydrocortisone to prednisolone we are unsure whether the therapies affect growth rate (due to the very low quality of the evidence). No trials included long‐term outcomes for quality of life, preventing an adrenal crisis, presence of bone fragility, presence of testicular or ovarian adrenal rest tumours, difficulty in conceiving and final adult height. Quality of the evidence Many trials had a high or unclear overall risk of bias. There were problems with the quality of the evidence, which was judged to be very low for all outcomes we considered across all the trials. This was because the trials were only small and if they compared a second treatment after the first, they did not leave enough time for the effects of the first treatment to clear. Also, people taking part had previously been treated with different glucocorticoids. Conclusions There is not enough evidence to show which steroid replacement treatment schedule results in better outcomes or which is the most effective form of steroid replacement therapy in CAH for adults and children. Large, well‐designed trials are needed to assess the effectiveness and safety of different steroid replacement therapies for treating 21‐hydroxylase deficiency CAH in children and adults. A longer duration of follow‐up is needed to monitor biochemical and clinical outcomes.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adolescent; Adrenal Hyperplasia, Congenital [*drug therapy]; Child; Child, Preschool; Dexamethasone; Glucocorticoids [*therapeutic use]; Humans; Infant; Prednisolone; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Young Adult","10.1002/14651858.CD012517.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012517.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Acute chest syndrome is a frequent complication of sickle cell disease, as well as a major cause of morbidity and the greatest single cause of mortality in children with sickle cell disease. Standard treatment may include intravenous hydration, oxygen as treatment for hypoxia, antibiotics to treat the infectious cause and blood transfusions may be given. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2010 and updated in 2016. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of blood transfusions, simple and exchange, for treating acute chest syndrome by comparing improvement in symptoms and clinical outcomes against standard care. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 30 May 2019. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing either simple or exchange transfusion versus standard care (no transfusion) in people with sickle cell disease suffering from acute chest syndrome. Data collection and analysis Both authors independently selected trials and assessed the risk of bias, no data could be extracted. Main results One trial was eligible for inclusion in the review. While in the multicentre trial 237 people were enrolled (169 SCC, 42 SC, 15 Sβ⁰‐thalassaemia, 11Sβ + ‐thalassaemia); the majority were recruited to an observational arm and only ten participants met the inclusion criteria for randomisation. Of these, four were randomised to the transfusion arm and received a single transfusion of 7 to 13 mL/kg packed red blood cells, and six were randomised to standard care. None of the four participants who received packed red blood cells developed acute chest syndrome, while 33% (two participants) developed acute chest syndrome in standard care arm. No data for any pre‐defined outcomes were available. Authors' conclusions We found only one very small randomised controlled trial; this is not enough to make any reliable conclusion to support the use of blood transfusion. Whilst there appears to be some indication that chronic blood transfusion may play a roll in reducing the incidence of acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease and albeit offering transfusions may be a widely accepted clinical practice, there is currently no reliable evidence to support or refute the perceived benefits of these as treatment options; very limited information about any of the potential harms associated with these interventions or indeed guidance that can be used to aid clinical decision making. Clinicians should therefore base any treatment decisions on a combination of; their clinical experience, individual circumstances and the unique characteristics and preferences of adequately informed people with sickle cell disease who are suffering with acute chest syndrome. This review highlights the need of further high quality research to provide reliable evidence for the effectiveness of these interventions for the relief of the symptoms of acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease. Plain language summary Blood transfusions for treating acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease Review question We reviewed the effectiveness of blood transfusions, for treating acute chest syndrome by comparing improvement in symptoms and clinical outcomes against standard care. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2010 and updated in 2016. Background Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood condition affecting over 250 million people worldwide and is particularly common in Sub‐Saharan Africa, South and Central America, Saudi Arabia, India and a number of Mediterranean countries. It is characterized by the presence of sickle‐shaped red blood cells which are capable of blocking the blood vessels causing pain and severe damage to several organs of the body. People with SCD may have the acute onset of chest problems which may include fever, this is called acute chest syndrome. Treatment will depend on the individuals' clinical condition and the severity of the symptoms. Standard treatment consists of supportive care, antibiotics, intravenous fluids and blood transfusion, either simple or exchange, may also be indicated. Search date The evidence is current to: 30 May 2019. Key results One study was included in the review, there were two parts to the study, one larger observational study and one randomised trial which was to assess transfusion versus standard care to prevent acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease, while twenty‐six centres were contracted. Only 10 participants were enrolled into the randomised trial. The effects of blood transfusions could not be determined from the trial; there were no data that could be presented or therefore analysed within this review for the very small number of participants enrolled. Therefore, this unique study did not show how effective blood transfusions might be for treating acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease. Future research is needed to provide evidence for people to make informed decisions on whether blood transfusions are effective for treating acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease.","1","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Blood Transfusion; Acute Chest Syndrome [etiology, mortality, *therapy]; Anemia, Sickle Cell [*complications]; Child; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Treatment Outcome","10.1002/14651858.CD007843.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007843.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD011231.PUB2","Wilson, LM; Morrison, L; Robinson, KA","Airway clearance techniques for cystic fibrosis: an overview of Cochrane systematic reviews","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2019","Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis is a life‐limiting genetic condition in which thick mucus builds up in the lungs, leading to infections, inflammation, and eventually, deterioration in lung function. To clear their lungs of mucus, people with cystic fibrosis perform airway clearance techniques daily. There are various airway clearance techniques, which differ in terms of the need for assistance or equipment, and cost. Objectives To summarise the evidence from Cochrane Reviews on the effectiveness and safety of various airway clearance techniques in people with cystic fibrosis. Methods For this overview, we included Cochrane Reviews of randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials (including cross‐over trials) that evaluated an airway clearance technique (conventional chest physiotherapy, positive expiratory pressure (PEP) therapy, high‐pressure PEP therapy, active cycle of breathing techniques, autogenic drainage, airway oscillating devices, external high frequency chest compression devices and exercise) in people with cystic fibrosis. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews on 29 November 2018. Two review authors independently evaluated reviews for eligibility. One review author extracted data from included reviews and a second author checked the data for accuracy. Two review authors independently graded the quality of reviews using the ROBIS tool. We used the GRADE approach for assessing the overall strength of the evidence for each primary outcome (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ), individual preference and quality of life). Main results We included six Cochrane Reviews, one of which compared any type of chest physiotherapy with no chest physiotherapy or coughing alone and the remaining five reviews included head‐to‐head comparisons of different airway clearance techniques. All the reviews were considered to have a low risk of bias. However, the individual trials included in the reviews often did not report sufficient information to adequately assess risk of bias. Many trials did not sufficiently report on outcome measures and had a high risk of reporting bias. We are unable to draw definitive conclusions for comparisons of airway clearance techniques in terms of FEV 1 , except for reporting no difference between PEP therapy and oscillating devices after six months of treatment, mean difference ‐1.43% predicted (95% confidence interval ‐5.72 to 2.87); the quality of the body of evidence was graded as moderate. The quality of the body of evidence comparing different airway clearance techniques for other outcomes was either low or very low. Authors' conclusions There is little evidence to support the use of one airway clearance technique over another. People with cystic fibrosis should choose the airway clearance technique that best meets their needs, after considering comfort, convenience, flexibility, practicality, cost, or some other factor. More long‐term, high‐quality randomised controlled trials comparing airway clearance techniques among people with cystic fibrosis are needed. Plain language summary Airway clearance techniques for cystic fibrosis: an overview of Cochrane Reviews We reviewed the evidence from Cochrane Reviews about the effect of airway clearance techniques in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Cystic fibrosis is a life‐limiting genetic condition that affects the respiratory and digestive systems. People with cystic fibrosis produce thick mucus that builds up in the lungs leading to infections and inflammation and eventually to a deterioration in lung function. People with cystic fibrosis perform airway clearance techniques at least daily to help keep their lungs clear of mucus. There are various airway clearance techniques, which differ in terms of the need for assistance or equipment, and cost. The airway clearance techniques included in this overview are conventional chest physiotherapy, various breathing techniques (active cycle of breathing technique, autogenic drainage), devices that create a positive pressure (positive expiratory pressure therapy (PEP) or high‐pressure PEP therapy) or a vibration (oscillating devices) to move mucus, and exercise. The condition is progressive and as lung function worsens, airway clearance techniques may not be sufficient. It may be useful to consider other therapies, such as hypertonic saline or dornase alfa, in addition to airway clearance techniques. These additional therapies are not covered in this overview. Search date The evidence is current to: 29 November 2018. Study characteristics This overview included six Cochrane Reviews. One review compared any type of chest physiotherapy (conventional chest physiotherapy, PEP therapy, high‐pressure PEP therapy, active cycle of breathing technique, autogenic drainage, exercise, vibrating (oscillating) devices) with no chest physiotherapy or coughing alone. The remaining five reviews included head‐to‐head comparisons of different airway clearance techniques, thus these five reviews often overlapped with each other. Key results In this overview, we found moderate evidence that PEP therapy and vibrating (oscillating) devices have a similar effect on lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) after six months of treatment. We are unable to draw definitive conclusions for all other comparisons in terms of FEV 1  because the quality of evidence is currently lacking. Likewise, we are unable to draw any definitive conclusions for other outcome measures such as individual preference and quality of life. Harms, such as acid reflux, collapsed lungs, coughing up blood, or decreased oxygen, were rarely mentioned in the original trials. There is a lack of evidence to determine if any particular airway clearance therapy is riskier than the other therapies. Quality of the evidence All of the reviews were considered to be well‐conducted. However, the individual trials included in the reviews often did not report enough detailed information to allow us to properly determine trial quality. Many trials did not report enough information on outcome measures; it is unclear how this missing information would influence the results. We graded the evidence for lung function when PEP was compared to vibrating (oscillating) devices as moderate, but the evidence comparing different airway clearance techniques for other outcomes, such as individual preference and quality of life was of low or very low quality. More long‐term, high‐quality trials (where participants are put into groups at random) which compare different airway clearance techniques among people with CF are needed.","1","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Systematic Reviews as Topic; Chest Wall Oscillation [instrumentation, methods]; Cystic Fibrosis [*therapy]; Drainage [methods]; Humans; Positive‐Pressure Respiration [*methods]; Respiratory Therapy [*methods]","10.1002/14651858.CD011231.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011231.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Authors' conclusions Currently, there is no high‐quality evidence to support or challenge the continued use of hydroxyurea for managing people with transfusion‐dependent β‐thalassaemia. Multicentre, randomised controlled trials (compared to placebo or other available treatment, i.e. blood transfusion and iron chelation) are needed in order to assess the efficacy and safety of hydroxyurea for reducing the need for blood transfusion, for maintaining or improving mean haemoglobin levels, as well as for determining its cost‐effectiveness. Plain language summary Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) for treating people with transfusion‐dependent beta‐thalassaemia Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) in people with transfusion‐dependent beta (β)‐thalassaemia. Background β‐thalassaemia is a blood disorder which is transferred by both parents to their children. In this condition less haemoglobin is produced. According to the WHO, almost 60,000 children with thalassaemia are born every year. Transfusion‐dependent β‐thalassaemia is the severe form of β‐thalassaemia, in which symptoms are clearly visible in the first six months of life. It can be fatal if left untreated, i.e. with blood transfusions. However, blood transfusions increase the chance of life‐threatening viral infections and of iron overload in the body, which affects major organs. Medicines for removing iron from the body can reduce the risk of iron overload, but the cost of managing the disease can often become too high for individuals and their families. Hydroxyurea is reported to be effective in treating β‐thalassaemia as it increases haemoglobin (blood) production and its benefits have previously been demonstrated. Search date The evidence is current to 04 March 2019. Study characteristics We found no trials for inclusion in the review. Key results We found no eligible trials for inclusion in the review. Multicentre, randomised controlled trials (compared to placebo or other available treatment, i.e. blood transfusion and iron chelation) are needed to assess the effectiveness and safety of hydroxyurea for reducing the need for blood transfusion, for maintaining or improving average levels of haemoglobin, as well as for assessing whether treatment is cost‐effective.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Blood Transfusion [*statistics & numerical data]; Hematinics [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Humans; Hydroxyurea [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; beta-Thalassemia [*drug therapy]","10.1002/14651858.CD012064.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012064.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) is found to be an effective drug which can reduce the risk of haemorrhage and can also stop bleeding in certain congenital bleeding disorders. Its use in pregnancy has been controversial. Hence beneficial and adverse effects of DDAVP in these groups of pregnant women should be evaluated. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2013 and updated in 2015. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of DDAVP in preventing and treating acute bleeding in pregnant women with bleeding disorders. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Coaguopathies Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant and abstract books of conferences proceedings. We also searched several clinical trial registries and grey literature (27 August 2017). Date of most recent search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Coaguopathies Trials Register: 01 October 2018. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials investigating the efficacy of DDAVP versus tranexamic acid or factor VIII or rFactor VII or fresh frozen plasma in preventing and treating congenital bleeding disorders during pregnancy were eligible. Data collection and analysis No trials matching the selection criteria were eligible for inclusion. Main results No trials matching the selection criteria were eligible for inclusion. Authors' conclusions No randomised controlled trials were identified investigating the relative effectiveness of DDAVP for bleeding during pregnancy in women with congenital bleeding disorders. In the absence of high‐quality evidence, clinicians need to use their clinical judgement and lower level evidence (e.g. from observational trials) to decide whether or not to treat women with congenital bleeding disorders with DDAVP. Given the ethical considerations, future randomised controlled trials are unlikely. However, other high‐quality controlled studies (such as risk allocation designs, sequential design, parallel cohort design) to investigate the risks and benefits of using DDAVP in this population are needed. Given that there are unlikely to be any trials published in this area, this review will no longer be regularly updated. Plain language summary Desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) for preventing and treating acute bleeds during pregnancy in women with congenital bleeding disorders Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect and safety of desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) in preventing and treating acute bleeding in pregnant women with bleeding disorders. This is an update of previously published versions of this Cochrane Review. Background Congenital bleeding disorders cause problems with bleeding during pregnancy, labour and delivery. Bleeding complications in women with congenital bleeding disorders are an important cause of disease and death linked to childbirth. Agents to stop the flow of blood are used for women with these bleeding disorders during pregnancy. DDAVP is a drug used to effectively increase the concentration of factor VIII in the blood and to increase the clumping together of platelets to stop bleeding. It does not come from human plasma and it carries no risk of infection. It might be a precious resource in people with von Willebrand disease, haemophilia A or congenital platelet disorders to prevent and treat bleeding episodes related to pregnancy. Search date The evidence is current to: 01 October 2018. Study characteristics We did not find any randomised controlled trials assessing desmopressin acetate in this group of women. Key results There were no trials included in the review. Given the ethical considerations, future randomised controlled trials are unlikely. Evidence is needed to show the risks and benefits of DDAVP when used to prevent and treat bleeding during pregnancy in women with congenital bleeding disorders. While there is evidence from observational trials that shows the drug is effective in stopping and preventing bleeding, we conclude that there is still a need to generate other high‐quality controlled evidence.

Although available in some centres, people with sickle cell anaemia are not routinely immunized with salmonella vaccines. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives To determine whether routine administration of salmonella vaccines to people with sickle cell disease reduces the morbidity and mortality associated with infection. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also conducted a search of the LILACS database and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/trialsearch) and ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov). Date of most recent searches: 17 October 2018. Selection criteria We planned to select all randomized controlled trials that compared the use of either the inactivated vaccine or an oral attenuated vaccine with a placebo among people with sickle cell disease. Equally, studies that compared the efficacy of one vaccine type over another were to be selected for the review. Data collection and analysis No trials of salmonella vaccines in people with sickle cell disease were found. Main results There is an absence of randomized controlled trial evidence relating to the scope of this review. Authors' conclusions It is expected that salmonella vaccines may be useful in people with sickle cell disease, especially in resource‐poor settings where the majority of those who suffer from the condition are found. Unfortunately, there are no randomized controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of the different types of salmonella vaccines in people with sickle cell disease. We conclude that there is a need for a well‐designed, adequately‐powered, randomized controlled trial to assess the benefits and risks of the different types of salmonella vaccines as a means of improving survival and decreasing mortality from salmonella infections in people with sickle cell disease. However, we believe that there are unlikely to be any trials published in this area, therefore, this review will no longer be regularly updated. Plain language summary Vaccines for preventing severe salmonella infections in people with sickle cell disease Review question Does the routine administration of salmonella vaccines to people with sickle cell disease reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with infection. Background Salmonella organisms are probably second only to pneumococcus among bacterial causes of infection in people with sickle cell disease. Infection with these bacteria can lead to complications and reduce the quality of life of people with the disease and sometimes result in death. Immunization with salmonella vaccines is one of the interventions available to reduce infection by these bacteria. There are different types of vaccines available: the inactivated vaccines and the oral vaccines. Search date The evidence is up to date as of 17 October 2018. Study characteristics We did not find any randomized controlled trials assessing these vaccines in people with sickle cell diseases. Key Results We conclude that there is a need for a randomized controlled trial to assess the benefits and risks of the different types of vaccines to evaluate the potential for improving survival and decreasing mortality from salmonella infections in people with sickle cell disease.

This mutation mainly affects the airways where excess salt absorption dehydrates the airway lining leading to impaired mucociliary clearance. Consequently, thick, sticky mucus accumulates making the airway prone to chronic infection and progressive inflammation; respiratory failure often ensues. Other complications include malnutrition, diabetes and subfertility. Increased understanding of the condition has allowed pharmaceutical companies to design mutation‐specific therapies targeting the underlying molecular defect. CFTR potentiators target mutation classes III and IV and aim to normalise airway surface liquid and mucociliary clearance, which in turn impacts on the chronic infection and inflammation. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To evaluate the effects of CFTR potentiators on clinically important outcomes in children and adults with CF. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles, reviews and online clinical trial registries. Last search: 21 November 2018. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of parallel design comparing CFTR potentiators to placebo in people with CF. A separate review examines trials combining CFTR potentiators with other mutation‐specific therapies. Data collection and analysis The authors independently extracted data, assessed the risk of bias in included trials and used GRADE to assess evidence quality. Trial authors were contacted for additional data. Main results We included five RCTs (447 participants with different mutations) lasting from 28 days to 48 weeks, all assessing the CFTR potentiator ivacaftor. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low, mainly due to risk of bias (incomplete outcome data and selective reporting) and imprecision of results, particularly where few individuals experienced adverse events. Trial design was generally well‐documented. All trials were industry‐sponsored and supported by other non‐pharmaceutical funding bodies. F508del (class II) (140 participants) One 16‐week trial reported no deaths, or changes in quality of life (QoL) or lung function (either relative or absolute change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (moderate‐quality evidence). Pulmonary exacerbations and cough were the most reported adverse events in ivacaftor and placebo groups, but there was no difference between groups (low‐quality evidence); there was also no difference between groups in participants interrupting or discontinuing treatment (low‐quality evidence). Number of days until the first exacerbation was not reported, but there was no difference between groups in how many participants developed pulmonary exacerbations. There was also no difference in weight. Sweat chloride concentration decreased, mean difference (MD) ‐2.90 mmol/L (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐5.60 to ‐0.20). G551D (class III) (238 participants) The 28‐day phase 2 trial (19 participants) and two 48‐week phase 3 trials (adult trial (167 adults), paediatric trial (52 children)) reported no deaths. QoL scores (respiratory domain) were higher with ivacaftor in the adult trial at 24 weeks, MD 8.10 (95% CI 4.77 to 11.43) and 48 weeks, MD 8.60 (95% CI 5.27 to 11.93 (moderate‐quality evidence). The adult trial reported a higher relative change in FEV1 with ivacaftor at 24 weeks, MD 16.90% (95% CI 13.60 to 20.20) and 48 weeks, MD 16.80% (95% CI 13.50 to 20.10); the paediatric trial reported this at 24 weeks, MD 17.4% (P < 0.0001)) (moderate‐quality evidence). These trials demonstrated absolute improvements in FEV1 (% predicted) at 24 weeks, MD 10.80% (95% CI 8.91 to 12.69) and 48 weeks, MD 10.44% (95% CI 8.56 to 12.32). The phase 3 trials reported increased cough, odds ratio (OR) 0.57 (95% CI 0.33 to 1.00) and episodes of decreased pulmonary function, OR 0.29 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.82) in the placebo group; ivacaftor led to increased dizziness in adults, OR 10.55 (95% CI 1.32 to 84.47). There was no difference between groups in participants interrupting or discontinuing treatment (low‐quality evidence). Fewer participants taking ivacaftor developed serious pulmonary exacerbations; adults taking ivacaftor developed fewer exacerbations (serious or not), OR 0.54 (95% CI 0.29 to 1.01). A higher proportion of participants were exacerbation‐free at 24 weeks with ivacaftor (moderate‐quality evidence). Ivacaftor led to a greater absolute change from baseline in FEV1 (% predicted) at 24 weeks, MD 10.80% (95% CI 8.91 to 12.69) and 48 weeks, MD 10.44% (95% CI 8.56 to 12.32); weight also increased at 24 weeks, MD 2.37 kg (95% CI 1.68 to 3.06) and 48 weeks, MD 2.75 kg (95% CI 1.74 to 3.75). Sweat chloride concentration decreased at 24 weeks, MD ‐48.98 mmol/L (95% CI ‐52.07 to ‐45.89) and 48 weeks, MD ‐49.03 mmol/L (95% CI ‐52.11 to ‐45.94). R117H (class IV) (69 participants) One 24‐week trial reported no deaths. QoL scores (respiratory domain) were higher with ivacaftor at 24 weeks, MD 8.40 (95% CI 2.17 to 14.63), but no relative changes in lung function were reported (moderate‐quality evidence). Pulmonary exacerbations and cough were the most reported adverse events in both groups, but there was no difference between groups; there was no difference between groups in participants interrupting or discontinuing treatment (low‐quality evidence). Number of days until the first exacerbation was not reported, but there was no difference between groups in how many participants developed pulmonary exacerbations. No changes in absolute change in FEV1 or weight were reported. Sweat chloride concentration decreased, MD ‐24.00 mmol/L (CI 95% ‐24.69 to ‐23.31). Authors' conclusions There is no evidence supporting the use of ivacaftor in people with the F508del mutation. Both G551D phase 3 trials demonstrated a clinically relevant impact of ivacaftor on outcomes at 24 and 48 weeks in adults and children (over six years of age) with CF. The R117H trial demonstrated an improvement in the respiratory QoL score, but no improvement in respiratory function. As new mutation‐specific therapies emerge, it is important that trials examine outcomes relevant to people with CF and their families and that adverse events are reported robustly and consistently. Post‐market surveillance is essential and ongoing health economic evaluations are required. Plain language summary Ivacaftor (marketed as Kalydeco®), a new specific therapy for cystic fibrosis Review question How does ivacaftor affect clinical outcomes (survival, quality of life and lung function) in people with cystic fibrosis (CF)? Background In people with CF, airway surfaces do not have enough water because of an abnormal protein; this makes it difficult to clear thick and sticky mucus, which leads to lung infections. Ivacaftor works on the abnormal protein in people with some mutations to allow the airways retain more water and better clear mucus, so fewer lung infections develop. Ivacaftor was aimed at people with class III and IV mutations, and has been studied in people with G551D (class III), R117H (class IV) and F508del (class II) mutations. Trial characteristics We included five trials (447 participants) comparing ivacaftor to placebo (dummy treatment with no active medication) lasting between four and 48 weeks. Three trials enrolled a total of 238 people with at least one copy of the G551D mutation, one trial enrolled 140 people with two copies of the F508del mutation and one enrolled 69 people with at least one copy of the R117H mutation. The evidence is up to date as of 21 November 2018. Key results F508del mutation The trial did not report any deaths or show improvements in lung function, quality of life scores or weight. Cough and pulmonary exacerbations (flare ups of lung disease) were the most reported adverse events when taking both ivacaftor and placebo; there were a similar number of flare ups for both groups. Sweat chloride concentrations were reduced with ivacaftor. G551D mutation No deaths were reported. Both children and adults taking ivacaftor showed improvements in lung function, but only adults reported higher quality of life scores. People given placebo reported more coughing and experienced more episodes of decreased lung function; more adults taking ivacaftor reported episodes of dizziness. Similar numbers of people taking ivacaftor and placebo delayed the course of medication, or withdrew from the trial altogether, due to side effects (e.g. psychological issues, liver disease, severe breathing problems). There were more serious pulmonary exacerbations whilst taking placebo compared to ivacaftor. Adults taking ivacaftor were admitted to hospital less often and had fewer courses of intravenous antibiotics for exacerbations. Both children and adults and children increased their weight with ivacaftor. There was a drop in sweat chloride concentrations with ivacaftor. R117H mutation No deaths occurred in this trial. While quality of life scores improved with ivacaftor, lung function did not. Cough and pulmonary exacerbations (flare ups of lung disease) were the most reported adverse events when taking both ivacaftor and placebo; there were a similar number of flare ups for both groups. There was no difference in weight; but as for other mutations there was a reduction in sweat chloride concentration with ivacaftor.    Evidence suggests that ivacaftor is an effective treatment for people (over six years of age) with cystic fibrosis and the G551D mutation, but not for those with the F508del or R117H mutations. Quality of the evidence In most trials, individuals were put into different treatment groups at random with equal chances of being given either placebo or ivacaftor; no one could work out which treatment the next person would receive, so that healthier people did not receive ivacaftor and make the results seem better. We were not sure whether anyone involved in the trial knew who was receiving which treatment and how this might affect results. No trials reported all results clearly; sometimes they did not report them in a way that we could use in the review and sometimes they did not report the data at all. This affected our certainty regarding the overall results. Information about some side effects was limited as not many people experienced them, therefore, it is difficult to judge whether there was a difference between treatment groups We judged the evidence in this review to be moderate to low quality. Trial funding sources All trials were sponsored by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated. The National Institute of Health (NIH), the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) and other non‐pharmaceutical funding bodies also supported the trials.","1","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adult; Age Factors; Aminophenols [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Child; Chloride Channel Agonists [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic; Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic; Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator [drug effects, *genetics]; Cystic Fibrosis [*drug therapy, *genetics]; Forced Expiratory Volume [drug effects]; Humans; Molecular Targeted Therapy [methods]; Mucociliary Clearance; Mutation [*genetics]; Quality of Life; Quinolones [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD009841.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009841.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Vitamin A deficiency predominantly causes eye and skin problems, while excessive levels of vitamin A can harm the respiratory and skeletal systems in children and interfere with the metabolism of other fat‐soluble vitamins. Most CF centres administer vitamin A as supplements to reduce the frequency of vitamin A deficiency in people with CF and to improve clinical outcomes such as growth, although the recommended dose varies between different guidelines. Thus, a systematic review on vitamin A and vitamin A‐like supplementation (carotenes or other retinoids) in people with CF would help guide clinical practice. This is an update of an earlier Cochrane Review. Objectives To determine if supplementation with vitamin A, carotenes or other retinoid supplements in children and adults with CF reduces the frequency of vitamin A deficiency disorders, improves general and respiratory health and affects the frequency of vitamin A toxicity. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Additionally we searched several ongoing trials registries, including ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Registry. Most recent database searches: 01 June 2018. Selection criteria All randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled studies comparing all preparations of oral vitamin A, carotenes or retinoids (or in combination), used as a supplement compared to placebo at any dose, for at least three months, in people with CF (diagnosed by sweat tests or genetic testing) with and without pancreatic insufficiency. Data collection and analysis Two authors individually assessed study quality and extracted data on outcome measures. The authors assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE system. Investigators were contacted to retrieve missing quantitative data. Main results No studies of vitamin A or other retinoid supplementation were eligible for inclusion. However, one randomised study of beta (β)‐carotene supplementation involving 24 people with CF who were receiving pancreatic enzyme substitution was included. The study compared successive β‐carotene supplementation periods (high dose followed by low dose) compared to placebo. The results for the low‐dose supplementation period should be interpreted with caution, due to the lack of a wash‐out period after the high‐dose supplementation. The included study did not report on two of the review's primary outcomes (vitamin A deficiency disorders and mortality); results for our third primary outcome of growth and nutritional status (reported as z score for height) showed no difference between supplementation and placebo, mean difference (MD) ‐0.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.89 to 0.43) (low‐quality evidence). With regards to secondary outcomes, supplementation with high‐dose β‐carotene for three months led to significantly fewer days of systemic antibiotics required to treat pulmonary exacerbations, compared to controls, MD ‐15 days (95% CI ‐27.60 to ‐2.40); however, this was not maintained in the second three‐month section of the study when the level of β‐carotene supplementation was reduced, MD ‐8 days (95% CI ‐18.80 to 2.80) (low‐quality evidence). There were no statistically significant effects between groups in lung function (low‐quality evidence) and no adverse events were observed (low‐quality evidence). Supplementation affected levels of β‐carotene in plasma, but not vitamin A levels. The study did not report on quality of life or toxicity. Authors' conclusions Since no randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled studies on retinoid supplementation were identified, no conclusion on the supplementation of vitamin A in people with CF can be drawn. Additionally, due to methodological limitations in the included study, also reflected in the low‐quality evidence judged following the specific evidence grading system (GRADE), no clear conclusions on β‐carotene supplementation can be drawn. Until further data are available, country‐ or region‐specific guidelines regarding these practices should be followed. Plain language summary The use of regular vitamin A or vitamin A‐like preparations for children and adults with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence regarding the effect of regular vitamin A or vitamin A‐like (carotenes or other retinoids) supplements in children and adults with cystic fibrosis. Background In people with cystic fibrosis only a small proportion of some vitamins, such as vitamin A, may be absorbed by the body and lead to problems caused by vitamin deficiency. A lack of vitamin A (vitamin A deficiency) can cause eye and skin problems and is associated with poorer general and respiratory health. Therefore, people with cystic fibrosis are usually supplemented with regular vitamin A preparations from a very young age. However, too much vitamin A can cause bone and liver problems. Excessive carotene levels are known to cause carotenaemia, a harmless, reversible yellowing of the skin, whilst a lack of carotene is not known to cause adverse manifestations in individuals with normal vitamin A levels. Search date The evidence is current to: 01 June 2018. Study characteristics No studies comparing vitamin A or other retinoid supplements to placebo (dummy drug containing no vitamin A) were included, but we did find one study comparing beta‐carotene supplementation (a precursor of vitamin A) to placebo. A total of 24 people with cystic fibrosis (aged 6.7 to 27.7 years) were put into groups at random and treated either with β‐carotene capsules (at a high dose for three months followed by a low dose for a further three months) or with placebo (for six months). Key results No studies on vitamin A supplementation were included in this review. The single included study revealed that high‐dose beta‐carotene supplementation for three months led to fewer days on which people with CF required antibiotics compared to placebo, but this was not the case in the following three‐month section of the study when low‐dose beta‐carotene supplementation was compared to placebo. Other clinical outcome measures (growth, nutritional status and lung function) showed no statistical significant differences between treatment and placebo groups. No side effects were observed. The other outcomes in this review, such as vitamin A deficiency symptoms, mortality, toxicity and quality of life, were not reported. Quality of the evidence We could only include one study in this review and that study had several limitations. This is reflected in the assessment of low‐quality evidence, judged using the specific evidence grading system (GRADE). So, we feel that the strength of evidence is low. Not all outcome measures were reported after each supplementation dose and results should be viewed with some caution as some beta‐carotene from the high‐dose period was probably still present in the blood during the low‐dose supplementation period. Conclusions Since no studies on vitamin A supplementation were included in the review, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the routine use of vitamin A supplements. Due to limitations of the included study of beta‐carotene supplementation, no definitive conclusions regarding its use can be drawn either. Until further evidence is available, local guidelines should be followed regarding supplementation.","8","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Humans; Provitamins [*administration & dosage]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Vitamin A Deficiency [*prevention & control]; Vitamin A [*administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Vitamins [*administration & dosage, adverse effects]; beta Carotene [*administration & dosage]","10.1002/14651858.CD006751.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006751.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD003426.PUB6","Nagalla, S; Ballas, SK","Drugs for preventing red blood cell dehydration in people with sickle cell disease","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2018","Abstract - Background Sickle cell disease is an inherited disorder of hemoglobin, resulting in abnormal red blood cells. These are rigid and may block blood vessels leading to acute painful crises and other complications. Recent research has focused on therapies to rehydrate the sickled cells by reducing the loss of water and ions from them. Little is known about the effectiveness and safety of such drugs. This is an updated version of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the relative risks and benefits of drugs to rehydrate sickled red blood cells. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register. We also searched online trials registries for any ongoing trials (01 July 2018). Last search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 08 October 2018. Selection criteria Randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled trials of drugs to rehydrate sickled red blood cells compared to placebo or an alternative treatment. Data collection and analysis Both authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed study quality and extracted data. Main results Of the 51 studies identified, three met the inclusion criteria, including 524 people with sickle cell disease aged between 12 and 65 years of age. One study tested the effectiveness of zinc sulphate as compared to placebo and the remaining two assessed senicapoc versus placebo. No deaths were seen in any of the studies (low‐quality evidence). The zinc sulphate study showed a significant reduction in painful crises (in a total of 145 participants) over one and a half years, mean difference ‐2.83 (95% confidence interval ‐3.51 to ‐2.15) (moderate‐quality evidence). However, analysis was restricted due to limited statistical data. Changes to red blood cell parameters and blood counts were inconsistent (very low‐quality evidence). No serious adverse events were noted in the study. The Phase II dose‐finding study of senicapoc (a Gardos channel blocker) compared to placebo showed that the high dose senicapoc showed significant improvement in change in hemoglobin level, the number and proportion of dense red blood cells, red blood cell count and indices and hematocrit value (very low‐quality evidence). The results with low‐dose senicapoc were similar to the high‐dose senicapoc group but of lesser magnitude. There was no difference in the frequency of painful crises between the three groups (low‐quality evidence). A subsequent Phase III study of senicapoc was terminated early since there was no difference observed between the treatment and control groups in the primary end point of painful crises. Authors' conclusions While the results of zinc for reducing sickle‐related crises are encouraging, larger and longer‐term multicenter studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of this therapy for people with sickle cell disease. While the Phase II and the prematurely terminated phase III studies of senicapoc showed that the drug improved red blood cell survival (depending on dose), this did not lead to fewer painful crises. Given this is no longer an active area of research, this review will no longer be regularly updated. Plain language summary Drugs that aim to reduce the loss of water from red blood cells in people with sickle cell disease Review question We reviewed the evidence to assess the relative risks and benefits of drugs to rehydrate sickled red blood cells. Background Sickle cell disease is an inherited condition that causes red blood cells to become sickle shaped when they lose water. This leads to a high risk of the blood vessels becoming blocked. Such blockages can cause pain, stroke and damage to organs. Recent therapies aim to stop the cells becoming sickle shaped by preventing them losing water. Search date The evidence is current to: 08 October 2018. Study characteristics The review included three studies with 524 people with sickle cell disease aged between 12 and 65 years of age. The intervention in one study was zinc sulphate and in two studies was senicapoc. Each study was compared to a placebo group (a substance which contains no medication). For each study people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly. The studies lasted from three months to 18 months. Key results The study with zinc sulphate showed that this drug may be able to reduce the number of sickle cell crises without causing toxic effects (low‐quality evidence). There were 145 participants in this study and results showed a significant reduction in the total number of serious sickle‐related crises over one and a half years, mean difference ‐2.83 (95% confidence interval ‐3.51 to ‐2.15) (moderate‐quality evidence). However, our analysis was limited since not all data were reported. Changes to red blood cell measurements and blood counts were not consistent (very low‐quality evidence). No serious adverse events were noted in the study. The two studies with senicapoc demonstrated that this drug increases the red blood survival and has a role in preventing red blood cell dehydration in people with sickle cell disease (very low‐quality evidence). The higher dose of the drug was more effective compared to the lower dose. But these changes in the red blood cells did not translate into positive clinical outcomes in terms of reduction in the number of sickle cell crises (low‐quality evidence). Senicapoc had a favourable safety profile. More longer‐term research is needed on these drugs and others that might prevent water loss in red blood cells. Given this is no longer an active area of research, this review will no longer be regularly updated. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence was mixed across outcomes.","10","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Acetamides [*therapeutic use]; Anemia, Sickle Cell [*blood, complications]; Antisickling Agents [*therapeutic use]; Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic; Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic; Dehydration [*prevention & control]; Early Termination of Clinical Trials; Erythrocyte Aging [drug effects]; Erythrocytes [*drug effects]; Humans; Piracetam [therapeutic use]; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Trityl Compounds [*therapeutic use]; Zinc Sulfate [*therapeutic use]","10.1002/14651858.CD003426.pub6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003426.pub6","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

The properties of aminoglycosides suggest that they could be given in higher doses less often. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of once‐daily versus multiple‐daily dosing of intravenous aminoglycoside antibiotics for the management of pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cystic Fibrosis Specialist Register held at the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's editorial base, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals and handsearching abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 31 January 2019. We also searched online trial registries. Date of latest search: 25 February 2019. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials, whether published or unpublished, in which once‐daily dosing of aminoglycosides has been compared with multiple‐daily dosing in terms of efficacy or toxicity or both, in people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis The two authors independently selected the studies to be included in the review and assessed the risk of bias of each study; authors also assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE criteria. Data were independently extracted by each author. Authors of the included studies were contacted for further information. As yet unpublished data were obtained for one of the included studies. Main results We identified 15 studies for possible inclusion in the review. Five studies reporting results from a total of 354 participants (aged 5 to 50 years) were included in this review. All studies compared once‐daily dosing with thrice‐daily dosing. One cross‐over trial had 26 participants who received the first‐arm treatment but only 15 received the second arm. One study had a low risk of bias for all criteria assessed; the remaining included studies had a high risk of bias from blinding, but for other criteria were judged to have either an unclear or a low risk of bias. There was little or no difference between treatment groups in: forced expiratory volume in one second, mean difference (MD) 0.33 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐2.81 to 3.48, moderate‐quality evidence); forced vital capacity, MD 0.29 (95% CI ‐6.58 to 7.16, low‐quality evidence); % weight for height, MD ‐0.82 (95% CI ‐3.77 to 2.13, low‐quality evidence); body mass index, MD 0.00 (95% CI ‐0.42 to 0.42, low‐quality evidence); or in the incidence of ototoxicity, relative risk 0.56 (95% CI 0.04 to 7.96, moderate‐quality evidence). Once‐daily treatment in children probably improved the percentage change in creatinine, MD ‐8.20 (95% CI ‐15.32 to ‐1.08, moderate‐quality evidence), but showed no difference in adults, MD 3.25 (95% CI ‐1.82 to 8.33, moderate‐quality evidence). The included trials did not report antibiotic resistance patterns or quality of life. Authors' conclusions Once‐ and three‐times daily aminoglycoside antibiotics appear to be equally effective in the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis. There is evidence of less nephrotoxicity in children. Plain language summary Giving aminoglycoside antibiotics intravenously once daily compared to giving them several times per day in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We looked for evidence to show the differences between giving intravenous antibiotics once daily compared to giving them several times a day when treating flare ups of disease (pulmonary exacerbations) in people with cystic fibrosis. This is an update of an earlier review. Background Most people with cystic fibrosis develop persistent lung infections and they may receive frequent courses of intravenous antibiotics to treat pulmonary exacerbations. Giving the antibiotics just once per day rather than several doses per day reduces the cost of treatment and the time involved. Search date The evidence is current to 31 January 2019. Study characteristics This review includes five studies with a total of 354 children and adults. All the trials compared once‐a‐day dosing with three times‐a‐day dosing. Key results The review found that when treating people with cystic fibrosis for pulmonary exacerbations, giving the antibiotics once per day was just as good at as giving them more frequently in terms of lung function and body mass index. The review also found that giving the antibiotics once per day appeared to be less toxic to the kidneys in children. There were no differences between the different treatment schedules for other outcomes that the studies measured. While once‐daily treatment can be just as effective and more convenient than three‐times daily treatment, we recommend further studies to look at the long‐term safety of this treatment schedule. Quality of the evidence We judged that just one of the five studies carried a low risk that any design factors might affect the outcome results. In the remaining four studies, we thought that the fact that it was obvious whether the antibiotics were given once or three times a day could affect some outcome measures (e.g. lung function). Other risk factors were unclear or at low risk of bias. We assessed the evidence for lung function, body mass index and the evidence for side effects (e.g. toxicity) to be moderate to low quality.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Lung Diseases [drug therapy, microbiology]; Aminoglycosides [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]; Anti‐Bacterial Agents [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]; Cystic Fibrosis [complications, *drug therapy]; Drug Administration Schedule; Drug Therapy, Combination [methods]; Forced Expiratory Volume [drug effects]; Humans; Injections, Intravenous; Pseudomonas Infections [drug therapy]; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Vital Capacity [drug effects]","10.1002/14651858.CD002009.pub7","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002009.pub7","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD006682.PUB6","Abbott, L; Plummer, A; Hoo, ZH; Wildman, M","Duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy in people with cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2019","Abstract - Background Progressive lung damage from recurrent exacerbations is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in cystic fibrosis. Life expectancy of people with cystic fibrosis has increased dramatically in the last 40 years. One of the major reasons for this increase is the mounting use of antibiotics to treat chest exacerbations caused by bacterial infections. The optimal duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy is not clearly defined. Individuals usually receive intravenous antibiotics for 14 days, but treatment may range from 10 to 21 days. A shorter duration of antibiotic treatment risks inadequate clearance of infection which could lead to further lung damage. Prolonged courses of intravenous antibiotics are expensive and inconvenient. The risk of systemic side effects such as allergic reactions to antibiotics also increases with prolonged courses and the use of aminoglycosides requires frequent monitoring to minimise some of their side effects. However, some organisms which infect people with cystic fibrosis are known to be multi‐resistant to antibiotics, and may require a longer course of treatment. This is an update of previously published reviews. Objectives To assess the optimal duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy for treating chest exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals, abstract books and conference proceedings. Most recent search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 30 May 2019. We also searched online trials registries. Most recent search of the ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) portal: 06 January 2019. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing different durations of intravenous antibiotic courses for acute respiratory exacerbations in people with CF, either with the same drugs at the same dosage, the same drugs at a different dosage or frequency or different antibiotics altogether, including studies with additional therapeutic agents. Data collection and analysis No eligible trials were identified for inclusion. A trial looking at the standardised treatment of pulmonary exacerbations is currently ongoing and will be included when the results are published.  Main results No eligible trials were included. Authors' conclusions There are no clear guidelines on the optimum duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment. Duration of treatment is currently based on unit policies and response to treatment. Shorter duration of treatment should improve quality of life and adherence, result in a reduced incidence of drug reactions and be less costly. However, the shorter duration may not be sufficient to clear a chest infection and may result in an early recurrence of an exacerbation. This systematic review identifies the need for a multicentre, randomised controlled trial comparing different durations of intravenous antibiotic treatment as it has important clinical and financial implications. The currently ongoing STOP2 trial is expected to provide some guidance on these questions when published. Plain language summary Length of time needed for antibiotic treatment given directly into the blood stream to clear acute chest infections in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about how long intravenous antibiotic treatment (antibiotics given directly into the blood stream) is needed to clear flare ups of chest symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Flare ups of symptoms (exacerbations) in people with cystic fibrosis are treated aggressively to prevent further damage to the lungs. This practice has led to better survival rates for people with cystic fibrosis in recent years. However, there are no clear guidelines on how long treatment with intravenous antibiotics should be to treat these flare ups. Different centres tend to use different treatment regimens. Most centres use 10 or 14 days, extending this to 21 days if there is no improvement in a person's symptoms. This is an update of previously published reviews. Search date The evidence is current to: 30 May 2019. Study characteristics No completed studies have compared different lengths of treatment with intravenous antibiotics, but there is one study under way looking at this question. When the results are published, we plan to include the study in this review. Key results Further research is needed to find the best duration of treatment for exacerbations. A shorter duration of treatment may be better as these courses of treatment are easier for people to complete. They are also less expensive and cause fewer drug reactions than longer treatments. However, it is not clear if shorter treatment is enough to treat infections adequately. It is also not clear whether shorter treatment results in early recurrence or increased frequency of chest infections.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Anti‐Bacterial Agents [*therapeutic use]; Bacterial Infections [*drug therapy, etiology]; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications, drug therapy]; Humans; Injections, Intravenous; Quality of Life; Respiratory Tract Infections [*drug therapy, etiology]","10.1002/14651858.CD006682.pub6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006682.pub6","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD011358.PUB3","Than, NN; Soe, HHK; Palaniappan, SK; Abas, ABL; De Franceschi, L","Magnesium for treating sickle cell disease","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2019","Abstract - Background Sickle cell disease is an autosomal recessive inherited haemoglobinopathy which causes painful vaso‐occlusive crises due to sickle red blood cell dehydration. Vaso‐occlusive crises are common painful events responsible for a variety of clinical complications; overall mortality is increased and life expectancy decreased compared to the general population. Experimental studies suggest that intravenous magnesium has proven to be well‐tolerated in individuals hospitalised for the immediate relief of acute (sudden onset) painful crisis and has the potential to decrease the length of hospital stay. Some in vitro studies and open studies of long‐term oral magnesium showed promising effect on pain relief but failed to show its efficacy. The studies show that oral magnesium therapy may prevent sickle red blood cell dehydration and prevent recurrent painful episodes. There is a need to access evidence for the impact of oral and intravenous magnesium effect on frequency of pain, length of hospital stay and quality of life. This is an updated version of the review. Objectives To evaluate the effects of short‐term intravenous magnesium on the length of hospital stay and quality of life in children and adults with sickle cell disease. To determine the effects of long‐term oral magnesium therapy on the frequency of painful crises and the quality of life in children and adults with sickle cell disease. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of last search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group’s Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 03 February 2019. Date of last search of other resources (clinical trials registries): 04 April 2019. Selection criteria We searched for published and unpublished randomized controlled studies of oral or intravenous magnesium compared to placebo or no magnesium. Data collection and analysis Authors independently assessed the study quality and extracted the data using standard Cochrane methodologies. Main results We included five randomized placebo‐controlled studies with a total of 386 participants (aged three to 53 years). Of these, two shorter parallel studies (n = 306) compared intravenous magnesium sulphate to placebo (normal saline) for admission to hospital due to a vaso‐occlusive crisis, for which we were able to analyse data. The quality of evidence was moderate for studies in this comparison, mainly due to limitations due to risk of bias and imprecision. Two of the three longer‐term studies comparing oral magnesium pidolate to placebo had a cross‐over design. The third was a parallel factorial study which compared hydroxyurea and oral magnesium to each other and to placebo over a longer period of time; we only present the comparison of oral magnesium to placebo from this study. The quality of evidence was very low with uncertainty of the estimation. The eight‐hourly dose levels in the two studies of intravenous magnesium were different; one used 100 mg/kg while the second used 40 mg/kg. Only one of these studies (n = 104) reported the mean daily pain score while hospitalised (a non‐significant difference between groups, moderate quality evidence). The second study (n = 202) reported a number of child‐ and parent‐reported quality of life scores. None of the scores showed any difference between treatment groups (low quality evidence). Data from one study (n = 106) showed no difference in length of stay in hospital between groups (low quality evidence). Both studies reported on adverse events, but not defined by severity as we had planned. One study showed significantly more participants receiving intravenous magnesium experienced warmth at infusion site compared to placebo; there were no differences between groups for other adverse events (low quality evidence). Three studies (n = 80) compared oral magnesium pidolate to placebo. None of them reported data which we were able to analyse. One study (n = 24) reported on the number of painful days and stated there was no difference between two groups (low quality evidence). None of the studies reported on quality of life or length of hospital stay. Two studies (n = 68) reported there were no differences in levels of magnesium in either plasma or red blood cells (moderate quality evidence). Two studies (n = 56) reported adverse events. One reported episodes of mild diarrhoea and headache, all of which resolved without stopping treatment. The second study reported adverse events as gastrointestinal disorders, headache or migraine, upper respiratory infections and rash; which were all evenly distributed across treatment groups (moderate quality evidence). Authors' conclusions Moderate to low quality evidence showed neither intravenous magnesium and oral magnesium therapy has an effect on reducing painful crisis, length of hospital stay and changing quality of life in treating sickle cell disease. Therefore, no definitive conclusions can be made regarding its clinical benefit. Further randomized controlled studies, perhaps multicentre, are necessary to establish whether intravenous and oral magnesium therapies have any effect on improving the health of people with sickle cell disease. Plain language summary Magnesium for treating sickle cell disease Review question We reviewed the evidence of the effect of intravenous (given into a vein) magnesium and oral (taken by mouth) magnesium on the frequency of painful crises (sickle cell crises with severe pain due to blockages of the blood supply to bones, joints, lungs, liver, spleen, kidney, eye or central nervous system), length of hospital stay and quality of life in people with different types of sickle cell disease. Background Sickle cell disease is a relatively common inherited blood disease. Its symptoms include the rapid onset of painful crises, which can lead to increased rates of hospital admission. The likely cause is that deformed sickle‐shaped red blood cells put stress on blood vessels which blocks them and leads to vaso‐occlusive crises. Vascular function is impaired in people with sickle cell disease. It is known that magnesium can widen blood vessels and, when regularly administered, it improves the amount of liquid in red blood cells and can help stop their shape deforming. Intravenous magnesium can cause mild to moderate side effects after administration e.g. nausea, vomiting, feeling of warmth, low blood pressure, etc.; and oral magnesium supplementation can cause mild side effects e.g. diarrhoea and abdominal cramps. We wanted to find out whether short‐term intravenous magnesium and long‐term oral magnesium is better than a placebo (dummy treatment with no magnesium) or no magnesium treatment, for reducing painful crises, shortening the length of stay in hospital and for improving quality of life. We were also interested in side effects of treatment with magnesium and some blood tests. This is an updated version of the review. Search date The evidence is current to: 03 February 2019. Study characteristics The review included five studies with a total of 386 people with sickle cell disease aged between four and 53 years .  Two studies (306 people) compared intravenous magnesium to a placebo (in this case saline (salty water)) in people admitted to hospital as an emergency because of pain and lasted until they were discharged (less than four weeks). Two of the three longer‐term studies compared oral magnesium pidolate with placebo and the third study compared hydroxyurea and magnesium pidolate to each other and to placebo but we have only included the results of the comparison of magnesium pidolate to placebo). Key results Not all the studies reported on our outcomes and we could not analyse data from most of the studies. We did find that in the people admitted to hospital as emergency cases, intravenous magnesium did not reduce pain levels, could not shorten the length of time spent in hospital and did not improve their quality of life compared to placebo. However, more people given magnesium experienced warmth where the needle was inserted than those people who were given placebo. Oral magnesium pidolate, given over a longer period, did not reduce the severity of painful episodes and had no measurable effect on properties of sickled red cells (e.g. magnesium levels in the blood). Oral magnesium appeared to be safe and well‐tolerated with only mild side effects (diarrhoea and headache). Further research is needed to compare the short‐term and long‐term benefits of magnesium treatment and its side effects. Quality of the evidence The quality of evidence for intravenous magnesium and oral magnesium in treating sickle cell disease was moderate for pain when using short‐term intravenous magnesium and for levels of magnesium in the blood when taking longer‐term oral magnesium supplements. The quality of evidence was low for all other outcomes we measured. All of the included studies of oral or intravenous magnesium for treating sickle cell disease had some aspects that could undermine the reliability of their results. Therefore, we have some uncertainty of these findings and further research may provide evidence that could change our conclusions.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adolescent; Adult; Anemia, Sickle Cell [blood, *drug therapy]; Antisickling Agents [*therapeutic use]; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Hydroxyurea [therapeutic use]; Magnesium Sulfate [therapeutic use]; Magnesium [blood, *therapeutic use]; Male; Middle Aged; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Young Adult","10.1002/14651858.CD011358.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011358.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

In most cases, bleeding episodes are spontaneous and severe at presentation. The optimal hemostatic therapy is controversial. Objectives To determine the efficacy of hemostatic therapies for acute bleeds in people with acquired hemophilia A; and to compare different forms of therapy for these bleeds. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2014, Issue 4) and MEDLINE (Ovid) (1948 to 30 April 2014). We searched the conference proceedings of the: American Society of Hematology; European Hematology Association; International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH); and the European Association for Haemophilia and Allied Disorders (EAHAD) (from 2000 to 30 April 2014). In addition to this we searched clinical trials registers. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised trials of hemostatic therapies for people with acquired hemophilia A, with no restrictions on gender, age or ethnicity. Data collection and analysis No trials matching the selection criteria were eligible for inclusion. Main results No trials matching the selection criteria were eligible for inclusion. Authors' conclusions No randomised clinical trials of hemostatic therapies for acquired hemophilia A were found. Thus, we are not able to draw any conclusions or make any recommendations on the optimal hemostatic therapies for acquired hemophilia A based on the highest quality of evidence. GIven that carrying out randomized controlled trials in this field is a complex task, the authors suggest that, while planning randomised controlled trials in which patients can be enrolled, clinicians treating the disease continue to base their choices on alternative, lower quality sources of evidence, which hopefully, in the future, will also be appraised and incorporated in a Cochrane Review. Plain language summary Treatments for acute bleeds in people with acquired hemophilia A Acquired hemophilia A is a rare but severe bleeding disorder caused by the autoantibody directed against factor VIII (FVIII, a blood clotting protein) in patients with no previous history of a bleeding disorder. This bleeding disorder occurs more frequently in the elderly and may be associated with several other conditions, such as solid tumours, autoimmune diseases, or with drugs; it is also sometimes associated with pregnancy. However, in about half of the cases the causes are unknown. Bleeding occurs in the skin; mucous membranes; and muscles; with joint bleeds being unusual. Therapies for acquired hemophilia A include treatments to stop acute bleeds and to destroy the FVIII autoantibodies. Acute bleeds can be treated with recombinant activated FVII or activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC). If these are unavailable, FVIII concentrates or 1‐desamino‐8‐D‐arginine‐vasopressin (DDAVP) fresh frozen plasma can be attempted; however, these last two options are not usually effective, and it is not known if one of these products is better than the other. We conducted a review of any treatment used in people with acquired hemophilia A during episodes of acute bleeding. After searching for all relevant trials, no randomised controlled trials could be identified, and no definitive conclusion on the best available treatment could be drawn. Prospective randomised controlled trials are needed to evaluate the precise role of different drugs for acute bleeds in acquired hemophilia A, but the rarity of the condition is hindering their planning and execution. While waiting for better evidence, patients and doctors need to base treatment decisions on the largest and better conducted observational studies, which are referenced in the background of our review.","8","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Factor VIII; Hemophilia A [complications, *drug therapy]; Hemorrhage [*drug therapy, etiology]; Humans","10.1002/14651858.CD010761.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010761.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Data collection and analysis No relevant trials were identified. Main results No trials were included in this review. Authors' conclusions Totally implantable vascular access devices are widely used in people with cystic fibrosis to provide intermittent venous access for therapeutic infusions. Reports of their use in people with cystic fibrosis suggest that they are safe and effective. These reports also suggest that certain interventions might reduce the risk of complications; however, it is disappointing that these reports have not been assessed by randomised controlled trials. This systematic review identifies the need for a multicentre randomised controlled trial assessing both efficacy and possible adverse effects of totally implantable venous access devices in cystic fibrosis. Plain language summary A tube fitted inside a vein to allow drug injections for people with cystic fibrosis Cystic fibrosis blocks the lungs with mucus and causes frequent infections and lung damage. Infections are often treated by giving drugs intravenously (through a vein), but regular injections can damage veins. Another option is to use a totally implantable vascular access device (TIVAD). There are different types of device and people with cystic fibrosis or their families can be shown how to administer drugs through them. TIVADs have no external portion attached when not in use and long‐term maintenance is quite easy. Some people feel that the devices improve their self‐image while others do not like the way they look. Sometimes TIVADs cause blood clots and infections. We looked for randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials of these devices in people with cystic fibrosis. The review found no trials to include. Reports of the use of TIVADs in people with cystic fibrosis suggest that they are safe and effective.

Individuals with this condition appear normal at birth but develop serious complications in childhood. Diagnosis and treatment started sufficiently early in life can effectively prevent or reduce the severity of these complications. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To determine if newborn population screening for the diagnosis of homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta synthase deficiency leads to clinical benefit compared to later clinical diagnosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register. Date of the most recent search of the Inborn Errors of Metabolism Register: 08 June 2015. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials assessing the use of any neonatal screening test to diagnose infants with homocystinuria before the condition becomes clinically evident. Eligible studies compare a screened population versus a non‐screened population. Data collection and analysis No studies were identified for inclusion in the review. Main results No studies were identified for inclusion in the review. Authors' conclusions We were unable to identify eligible studies for inclusion in this review and hence it is not possible to draw any conclusions based on controlled studies; however, we are aware of uncontrolled case‐series which support the efficacy of newborn screening for homocystinuria and its early treatment. Any future randomised controlled trial would need to be both multicentre and long term in order to provide robust evidence for or against screening and to allow a cost effectiveness analysis to be undertaken. Plain language summary Newborn screening for homocystinuria Review question We reviewed the evidence to determine if newborn population screening for the diagnosis of homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta synthase deficiency leads to clinical improvement compared to later clinical diagnosis and to determine the psychological effects on parents or carers of newborn population screening for homocystinuria. This is an update of a previously published review. Background Homocystinuria is a rare condition caused by mistakes in a gene that is responsible for making an enzyme called cystathionine beta synthase. People with homocystinuria have a deficiency of this enzyme and as a result have high levels of a substance called homocysteine in their bodies. Although such individuals appear normal at birth, over a period of months and years, they develop serious problems that effect eyesight, lead to delayed mental development, cause unhealthy bones, and have a high risk of having blood clots. Treatment with a special diet and medicines can prevent the development of these complications, but must be started very early in life to be truly effective. In some parts of the world homocystinuria has been tested for in newborn babies. Search date The evidence is current to: 08 June 2015. Key results No trials were found. We know of some uncontrolled studies which suggest that newborn screening for homocystinuria and its early treatment are effective. Future long‐term research is needed to provide strong evidence for or against screening. This research may also show whether screening is cost effective.","10","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Cystathionine beta-Synthase [*deficiency]; Early Diagnosis; Homocystinuria [*diagnosis]; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Neonatal Screening","10.1002/14651858.CD008840.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008840.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Dietary restriction of phenylalanine keeps blood phenylalanine concentration low. Most natural foods are excluded from diet and supplements are used to supply other nutrients. Recent publications report a decrease in blood phenylalanine concentration in some patients treated with sapropterin dihydrochloride. We examined the evidence for the use of sapropterin dihydrochloride to treat phenylketonuria. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review.  Objectives To assess the safety and efficacy of sapropterin dihydrochloride in lowering blood phenylalanine concentration in people with phenylketonuria. Search methods We identified relevant trials from the Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register. Date of last search: 11 August 2014. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and Current controlled trials. Last search: 4 September 2014 We contacted the manufacturers of the drug (BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.) for information regarding any unpublished trials. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials comparing sapropterin with no supplementation or placebo in people with phenylketonuria due to phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trials and extracted outcome data. Main results Two placebo‐controlled trials were included. One trial administered 10 mg/kg/day sapropterin in 89 children and adults with phenylketonuria whose diets were not restricted and who had previously responded to saproterin.This trial measured change in blood phenylalanine concentration. The second trial screened 90 children (4 to 12 years) with phenylketonuria whose diet was restricted, for responsiveness to sapropterin. Forty‐six responders entered the placebo‐controlled part of the trial and received 20 mg/kg/day sapropterin. This trial measured change in both phenylalanine concentration and protein tolerance. Both trials reported adverse events. The trials showed an overall low risk of bias; but both are Biomarin‐sponsored. One trial showed a significant lowering in blood phenylalanine concentration in the sapropterin group (10 mg/kg/day), mean difference ‐238.80 μmol/L (95% confidence interval ‐343.09 to ‐134.51); a second trial (20 mg/kg/day sapropterin) showed a non‐significant difference, mean difference ‐51.90 μmol/L (95% confidence interval ‐197.27 to 93.47). The second trial also reported a significant increase in phenylalanine tolerance, mean difference18.00 mg/kg/day (95% confidence interval 12.28 to 23.72) in the 20 mg/kg/day sapropterin group. Authors' conclusions There is evidence of short‐term benefit from using sapropterin in some people with sapropterin‐responsive forms of phenylketonuria; blood phenylalanine concentration is lowered and protein tolerance increased. There are no serious adverse events associated with using sapropterin in the short term. There is no evidence on the long‐term effects of sapropterin and no clear evidence of effectiveness in severe phenylketonuria. Plain language summary The use of sapropterin to lower phenylalanine concentration in blood in people with phenylketonuria. Phenylketonuria occurs due to an inherited deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. If untreated it causes an excessive accumulation of the amino acid phenylalanine in the body which prevents normal brain development. The established treatment for phenylketonuria consists of dietary restriction of natural protein but with prescribed phenylalanine‐free amino acid, mineral and vitamin supplements. With this treatment the long‐term outcome for people with phenylketonuria is excellent but the diet is onerous. Sapropterin dihydrochloride, the cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase, could lower phenylalanine concentration significantly in phenylketonuria and might allow a relaxation of dietary restrictions. The review identified two trials of sapropterin dihydrochloride; one in children and adults with no restricted diet and one in just children whose diet was restricted. The trials used different doses of sapropterin dihydrochloride (10 mg/kg/day and 20 mg/kg/day). We could not combine any data due to different formats of presentation. We found evidence to show that some people with mild or moderate phenylketonuria can benefit from the use of sapropterin dihydrochloride in the short term; the concentration of blood phenylalanine was lowered after treatment in both trials. The trial with the higher dose also measured the outcome change in protein tolerance. It reported an increase in protein tolerance in response to sapropterin. There were no adverse effects associated with the use of sapropterin dihydrochloride in the short term. We found no evidence on the effects of long‐term treatment. We could not draw any conclusions on its benefits in severe phenylketonuria.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adult; Biopterin [administration & dosage, adverse effects, *analogs & derivatives]; Child; Child, Preschool; Humans; Phenylalanine [*blood]; Phenylketonurias [blood, *drug therapy]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD008005.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008005.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Retrospective studies have suggested that using an aggressive policy of intravenous anti‐pseudomonal antibiotics at regular intervals, irrespective of symptoms, increases survival. Objectives To determine whether there is evidence that an elective (regular) versus symptomatic intravenous antibiotic regimen is associated with an improvement in clinical status and survival rates in people with cystic fibrosis. To identify any adverse effects associated with the use of elective intravenous antibiotics, including an increase in the development of resistant organisms. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 15 March 2012. Selection criteria All randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials describing the use of elective compared with symptomatic intravenous antibiotic policies for any duration or dose regimen. Elective versus symptomatic intravenous antibiotic regimens against any organisms were considered. People with cystic fibrosis of any age or disease severity were included. Data collection and analysis Both authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality; both extracted the data. Main results Searches identified four studies. Two studies reporting results from a total of 79 participants were included in the review. Differences in study design and objectives meant that data could not be pooled for meta‐analysis. Neither study demonstrated significant differences in outcome measures between intervention and comparison groups. Authors' conclusions Studies are insufficient to identify conclusive evidence favouring a policy of elective intravenous antibiotic administration, despite its widespread use, neither are the potential risks adequately evaluated. The results should be viewed with caution, as participant numbers are small. Clearly there is a need for a well‐designed, adequately‐powered, multicentred randomised controlled trial to evaluate these issues. This review will no longer be regularly updated.

Plain language summary Elective (regular) versus symptomatic intravenous antibiotic therapy for cystic fibrosis Chronic infection of the airways by  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in people with cystic fibrosis is associated with deterioration in respiratory function. Intravenous antibiotics are the standard therapy for pulmonary exacerbations caused by this micro‐organism. Many centres advocate the use of elective (regular) three‐monthly antibiotics to reduce the frequency of exacerbations and therefore slow the deterioration of lung function. Alternatively, intravenous antibiotics are only prescribed when symptoms indicate. Elective therapy may encourage multi‐resistance to antibiotics. This review aimed to identify randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials that evaluated the results of the two different approaches. No clear conclusions were identified.

Many different bacteria can cause this infection and antibiotic treatment is generally needed to resolve it. There is no standardized approach to antibiotic therapy and treatment is likely to vary from country to country. Thus, there is a need to identify the efficacy and safety of different antibiotic treatment approaches for people with sickle cell disease suffering from community‐acquired pneumonia. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives To determine the efficacy and safety of the antibiotic treatment approaches (monotherapy or combined) for people with sickle cell disease suffering from community‐acquired pneumonia. Search methods We searched The Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register (01 September 2016), which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched LILACS (1982 to 01 September 2016), African Index Medicus (1982 to 20 October 2016) and WHO ICT Registry (20 October 2016). Selection criteria We searched for published or unpublished randomized controlled trials. Data collection and analysis We intended to summarise data by standard Cochrane methodologies, but no eligible randomized controlled trials were identified. Main results We were unable to find any randomized controlled trials on antibiotic treatment approaches for community‐acquired pneumonia in people with sickle cell disease. Authors' conclusions The updated review was unable to identify randomized controlled trials on efficacy and safety of the antibiotic treatment approaches for people with sickle cell disease suffering from community‐acquired pneumonia. Randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the optimum antibiotic treatment for this condition. The trials regarding this issue should be structured and reported according to the CONSORT statement for improving the quality of reporting of efficacy and improved reports of harms in clinical research. Triallists should consider including the following outcomes in new trials: number of days to become afebrile; mortality; onset of pain crisis or complications of sickle cell disease following community‐acquired pneumonia; diagnosis; hospitalization (admission rate and length of hospital stay); respiratory failure rate; and number of participants receiving a blood transfusion. There are no trials included in the review and we have not identified any relevant trials up to September 2016. We therefore do not plan to update this review until new trials are published.

"CD008253.PUB4","Beer, H; Southern, KW; Swift, AC","Topical nasal steroids for treating nasal polyposis in people with cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2015","Abstract - Background Nasal polyps frequently occur in people with cystic fibrosis. Sinus infections have been shown to be a factor in the development of serious chest complications in these people. Nasal polyps have been linked to a higher risk of lower respiratory tract infections with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  . Topical nasal steroids are of proven efficacy for treating nasal polyposis in the non‐cystic fibrosis population. There is no clear current evidence for the efficacy of topical steroids for nasal polyps in people with cystic fibrosis. This is an updated version of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of topical nasal steroids for treating symptomatic nasal polyps in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Latest search: 10 June 2015. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled comparing the effects of topical nasal steroids to placebo in people with nasal polyps with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed risk of bias in the included trial and extracted data. Main results One single‐centred trial (46 participants) was identified comparing a topical steroid (betamethasone) given as nasal drops to placebo. Treatment was given twice daily for six weeks; 22 participants received the active drug. Subjective symptom scores, change in polyp size, and side effects were assessed. There was no difference in nasal symptom scores between the treatment and placebo groups. Betamethasone was effective in reducing the size of polyps, but was associated with increased reports of mild side effects, nasal bleeding and discomfort. Risk of bias was high since over 50% of people enrolled did not complete the study. Follow‐up of participants was short (six weeks) also reducing the significance of the results for clinical practice. Authors' conclusions This review suggests topical steroids for nasal polyposis in people with cystic fibrosis have no demonstrable effect on subjective nasal symptom scores. They have some effect in reducing the size of the polyps, but due to the small sample size, poor completion rates and lack of follow‐up, the trial is at high risk of bias and evidence for efficacy is limited. Overall there is no clear evidence for using topical steroids in people with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis. A well‐designed randomised controlled trial of adequate power and long‐term follow‐up is needed. Validated measures of symptoms and physical findings should be performed and quality of life issues addressed. Plain language summary Steroids applied directly to polyps in the nose in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence on the effect of applying steroids directly to polyps in the noses of people with cystic fibrosis. Background People with cystic fibrosis often have polyps in their nose which can cause discharge and also a blocked nose. We know that people with cystic fibrosis and polyps in their nose also have more of some types of bacteria in their lungs. This can lead to serious chest complications later on. If we treat the polyps effectively at an early stage, we may prevent these chest complications. Steroid sprays or drops are often applied directly to polyps in the nose.These drugs are usually a safe treatment but can have some important side effects, like affecting the immune system and how the body can regulate blood sugar. They also add to the existing burden of treatment, especially if they need to be taken for the rest of a person's life. However, these drugs have been shown to be successful in treating polyps in people who do not have cystic fibrosis. Search date The evidence is current to: 10 June 2015. Study characteristics Our search found one trial with 46 adult volunteers with cystic fibrosis which compared nasal drops containing a steroid (betamethasone) to identical drops containing no active treatment. Two drops were applied directly to polyps twice a day for six weeks. Volunteers were put into the different treatment groups at random and a total of 22 volunteers received the steroid drops and 24 received the dummy treatment. Key results The trial measured each person's perception of their symptom scores, but found no difference to the scores whether volunteers were using the steroid drops or the dummy treatment. The trial also measured the change in polyp size and found that they shrank. There were no major side effects linked to using betamethasone, and only three volunteers reported increased nose bleeds and discomfort. The small number of volunteers in this trial means the calculations and results should be regarded with some caution. More trials are needed to confirm the findings and these trials should report on measures of symptoms and quality of life issues. Quality of the evidence We think that volunteers had a truly equal chance of being put in either the steroid group or the control group and wouldn't have known which treatment they were receiving, so these issues would not have influenced the results in any way. However, over 50% of people enrolled did not complete the study and the reasons for dropping out were not very clearly explained. We think it is important to take this fact into account when considering the trial results. Also, the trial only followed the volunteers for six weeks, which is a short time when evaluating a treatment that could be needed for the rest of a person's life.","6","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Administration, Intranasal [methods]; Adult; Betamethasone [*administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Glucocorticoids [*administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Humans; Nasal Polyps [complications, *drug therapy]","10.1002/14651858.CD008253.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008253.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD008243.PUB2","Prayle, AP; Hurley, MN; Smyth, AR","Percutaneous lines for delivering intravenous antibiotics in people with cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2010","Abstract - Background Percutaneous long lines (long intravenous lines) and short intravenous lines (also termed cannulae) are both used to deliver intravenous antibiotics in cystic fibrosis to treat respiratory exacerbations of the disease. The perceived advantage of a long intravenous line is a greater duration of line function, which has to be balanced against a technically more challenging insertion procedure, and the possibility of more discomfort on insertion. Objectives To compare long intravenous lines with short intravenous lines in people with cystic fibrosis receiving intravenous antibiotics, in terms of lifespan of the line, ease of insertion, complication rates of the line and patient satisfaction. This will help patients and clinicians choose between devices. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of most recent search: 26 August 2010. Selection criteria Randomised studies comparing long intravenous lines lines with short intravenous lines or comparing different types of long intravenous lines. Data collection and analysis We identified two studies, one comparing long intravenous lines with short intravenous lines, and one comparing two different types of long intravenous lines. Main results Two studies (67 participants) were included in the review. Based on the published reports, both studies had potential for bias in several domains. There is some evidence that long intravenous lines are superior to short intravenous lines. One study of 20 participants found that the lifespan of a long intravenous line is longer than that of a short intravenous line, and that participants preferred the long intravenous lines to short intravenous lines. A further study of 47 participants found no difference in lifespan, or participant preference when comparing two different long intravenous lines (the Hydrocath and Vygon EC). Neither study was powered to detect differences in serious complications of the devices. Authors' conclusions There is some evidence to support the use of long intravenous lines rather than short intravenous lines, in terms of lifespan of the line and patient satisfaction. There is no evidence to suggest that any one type of long intravenous line is superior, and currently choice of line should be determined by operator and patient preference. There are numerous devices available which are used in cystic fibrosis. Further research is required to identify clinically important differences between these devices. Plain language summary Intravenous antibiotics can be delivered through a variety of devices In cystic fibrosis, patients require prolonged courses of intravenous antibiotics. There are several devices which can be used to administer intravenous antibiotics, including peripheral cannulae (which we have termed short intravenous lines) and percutaneous (through the skin) long intravenous lines. A percutaneous long intravenous line is a flexible narrow tube which is inserted with a needle through the skin into a vein and threaded further up the vein than a short intravenous line. We have found two trials comparing these devices and including 67 participants in total. The studies compared different devices, so we could not pool the information from the two studies. However, one study showed that long intravenous lines last for longer than short intravenous lines (thus reducing the number of procedures which a participant has to undergo for a course of antibiotics). Patient satisfaction was higher with long intravenous lines compared to short intravenous lines. The study comparing two different types of long intravenous line did not show that one type was clearly better than another. Neither study was large enough to show differences in complications for the different devices. Neither study reported on important outcomes, such as the number of attempts required to insert the device. We recommend further research to compare different types of percutaneous long intravenous line.","11","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Catheters, Indwelling; Anti‐Bacterial Agents [*administration & dosage]; Bacterial Infections [*drug therapy, etiology]; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Humans; Infusions, Intravenous [instrumentation, psychology]; Lung Diseases [*drug therapy, etiology]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD008243.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008243.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD002769.PUB5","Moran, F; Bradley, JM; Piper, AJ","Non‐invasive ventilation for cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2017","Abstract - Background Non‐invasive ventilation may be a means to temporarily reverse or slow the progression of respiratory failure in cystic fibrosis by providing ventilatory support and avoiding tracheal intubation. Using non‐invasive ventilation, in the appropriate situation or individuals, can improve lung mechanics through increasing airflow and gas exchange and decreasing the work of breathing. Non‐invasive ventilation thus acts as an external respiratory muscle. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To compare the effect of non‐invasive ventilation versus no non‐invasive ventilation in people with cystic fibrosis for airway clearance, during sleep and during exercise. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We searched the reference lists of each trial for additional publications possibly containing other trials. Most recent search: 08 August 2016. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing a form of pressure preset or volume preset non‐invasive ventilation to no non‐invasive ventilation used for airway clearance or during sleep or exercise in people with acute or chronic respiratory failure in cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Three reviewers independently assessed trials for inclusion criteria and methodological quality, and extracted data. Main results Ten trials met the inclusion criteria with a total of 191 participants. Seven trials evaluated single treatment sessions, one evaluated a two‐week intervention, one evaluated a six‐week intervention and one a three‐month intervention. It is only possible to blind trials of airway clearance and overnight ventilatory support to the outcome assessors. In most of the trials we judged there was an unclear risk of bias with regards to blinding due to inadequate descriptions. The six‐week trial was the only one judged to have a low risk of bias for all other domains. One single intervention trial had a low risk of bias for the randomisation procedure with the remaining trials judged to have an unclear risk of bias. Most trials had a low risk of bias with regard to incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. Six trials (151 participants) evaluated non‐invasive ventilation for airway clearance compared with an alternative chest physiotherapy method such as the active cycle of breathing techniques or positive expiratory pressure. Three trials used nasal masks, one used a nasal mask or mouthpiece and one trial used a face mask and in one trial it is unclear. Three of the trials reported on one of the review's primary outcome measures (quality of life). Results for the reviews secondary outcomes showed that airway clearance may be easier with non‐invasive ventilation and people with cystic fibrosis may prefer it. We were unable to find any evidence that non‐invasive ventilation increases sputum expectoration, but it did improve some lung function parameters. Three trials (27 participants) evaluated non‐invasive ventilation for overnight ventilatory support compared to oxygen or room air using nasal masks (two trials) and nasal masks or full face masks (one trial). Trials reported on two of the review's primary outcomes (quality of life and symptoms of sleep‐disordered breathing). Results for the reviews secondary outcome measures showed that they measured lung function, gas exchange, adherence to treatment and preference, and nocturnal transcutaneous carbon dioxide .  Due to the small numbers of participants and statistical issues, there were discrepancies in the results between the RevMan and the original trial analyses. No clear differences were found between non‐invasive ventilation compared with oxygen or room air except for exercise performance, which significantly improved with non‐invasive ventilation compared to room air over six weeks. One trial (13 participants) evaluated non‐invasive ventilation on exercise capacity (interface used was unclear) and did not reported on any of the review's primary outcomes. The trial found no clear differences between non‐invasive ventilation compared to no non‐invasive ventilation for any of our outcomes. Three trials reported on adverse effects. One trial, evaluating non‐invasive ventilation for airway clearance, reported that a participant withdrew at the start of the trial due to pain on respiratory muscle testing. One trial evaluating non‐invasive ventilation for overnight support reported that one participant could not tolerate an increase in inspiratory positive airway pressure. A second trial evaluating non‐invasive ventilation in this setting reported that one participant did not tolerate the non‐invasive ventilation mask, one participant developed a pneumothorax when breathing room air and two participants experienced aerophagia which resolved when inspiratory positive airway pressure was decreased. Authors' conclusions Non‐invasive ventilation may be a useful adjunct to other airway clearance techniques, particularly in people with cystic fibrosis who have difficulty expectorating sputum. Non‐invasive ventilation, used in addition to oxygen, may improve gas exchange during sleep to a greater extent than oxygen therapy alone in moderate to severe disease. The effect of NIV on exercise is unclear. These benefits of non‐invasive ventilation have largely been demonstrated in single treatment sessions with small numbers of participants. The impact of this therapy on pulmonary exacerbations and disease progression remain unclear. There is a need for long‐term randomised controlled trials which are adequately powered to determine the clinical effects of non‐invasive ventilation in cystic fibrosis airway clearance and exercise. Plain language summary A machine pushes air into the lungs helping people with cystic fibrosis breathe, clear mucus, reduce respiratory failure, improve exercise tolerance Review question We reviewed the evidence that mechanically pushing air into the lungs through a mask helps clear mucus, improves breathing overnight, reduces respiratory failure and improves exercise tolerance. Background As cystic fibrosis worsens, breathing becomes difficult, indicating the start of respiratory failure (too much carbon dioxide and not enough oxygen in the blood). As respiratory failure progresses, people may become breathless and have problems clearing mucus. Respiratory failure eventually results in death. Non‐invasive ventilation administers room air or oxygen through a mask and has been used to help people with more severe cystic fibrosis to clear their airways of mucus and improve breathing during sleep; it may also help with exercise. It is not certain exactly how this works, but it might reduce fatigue in the respiratory muscles, stop the airways from closing during prolonged exhalation and reduce the effort needed to maintain ventilation and oxygen levels. Treatment has been recommended when breathing muscles are weak, when a person has difficulty clearing mucus using other airway clearance techniques or when there are high levels of carbon dioxide in the blood during sleep or during exercise. This is an update of a previously published review. Search date Evidence is current to 08 August 2016. Study characteristics This review includes 10 trials (191 people with cystic fibrosis) ‐ seven single‐treatment sessions and a two‐week trial, a six‐week trial and a three‐month trial. Six single‐treatment trials, the two‐week trial and the three‐month trial compared non‐invasive ventilation with other airway clearance techniques. Two single‐treatment trials and the six‐week trial looked at non‐invasive ventilation for overnight breathing support compared to oxygen or normal room air. One single‐treatment trial compared non‐invasive ventilation with no additional treatment during an exercise test. Key results Single‐treatment trials of non‐invasive ventilation for airway clearance showed that this may be easier with non‐invasive ventilation and people with cystic fibrosis may prefer it to other methods. We could not find evidence that non‐invasive ventilation increased the amount of mucus coughed up, but it did improve some measures of lung function, at least in the short term. The two‐week trial did not demonstrate clear benefits between groups. The original three‐month trial report stated an improvement in lung clearance index. One person in one of these trials reported pain on respiratory muscle testing. The three trials comparing overnight support from non‐invasive ventilation measured lung function, quality of life and carbon dioxide levels; they showed it is effective, safe and acceptable. We found no clear differences between non‐invasive ventilation and oxygen or room air, except for exercise performance which improved with non‐invasive ventilation compared to room air after six weeks. Two trials reported side effects. In the first trial, one person found the mask uncomfortable. In the second trial, one person in the room air group had collapsed lungs and two people could not tolerate increased pressure when breathing in. The trial comparing the effects of non‐invasive ventilation to no treatment on exercise capacity found no clear differences between groups. Non‐invasive ventilation may help alongside other airway clearance techniques, particularly when people with cystic fibrosis have difficulty coughing up mucus and during sleep. Long‐term trials are needed with enough people to show the clinical effects of non‐invasive ventilation on airway clearance, during sleep and exercise training in severe disease. Quality of the evidence The benefits of non‐invasive ventilation have largely been demonstrated in single‐treatment sessions with only small numbers of people. There is limited evidence of some longer‐term improvement in lung function in one trial. Our results from the trials of overnight breathing support differed from those in the original analyses, this is likely due to the small numbers of participants and some statistical issues. We judged only the six‐week trial to be free from any bias. In the remaining trials, we thought there were low or unclear chances of the results being affected because data were either reported only partially or not at all. We were not sure if the way in which participants were put into the different treatment groups would affect the results of the trials.","2","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Sputum; Cystic Fibrosis [*therapy]; Humans; Masks; Noninvasive Ventilation [*methods]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Insufficiency [prevention & control]","10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002769.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

This treatment varies according to the specific haemostatic defect, its severity and the type of surgical procedure. The aim of treatment is to ensure adequate haemostatic coverage for as long as the bleeding risk persists and until wound healing is complete. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of different haemostatic regimens (type, dose and duration, modality of administration and target haemostatic levels) administered in people with haemophilia or other congenital bleeding disorders for preventing bleeding complications during and after surgical procedures. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of the last search: 20 November 2014. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing any hemostatic treatment regimen to no treatment or to another active regimen in children and adults with haemophilia or other congenital bleeding disorders undergoing any surgical intervention. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trials (eligibility and risks of bias) and extracted data. Meta‐analyses were performed on available and relevant data. Main results Of the 16 identified trials, four (112 participants) were eligible for inclusion. Two trials evaluated 59 people with haemophilia A and B undergoing 63 dental extractions. Trials compared the use of a different type (tranexamic acid or epsilon‐aminocaproic acid) and regimen of antifibrinolytic agents as haemostatic support to the initial replacement treatment. Neither trial specifically addressed mortality (one of this review's primary outcomes); however, in the frame of safety assessments, no fatal adverse events were reported. The second primary outcome of blood loss was assessed after surgery and these trials showed the reduction of blood loss and requirement of post‐operative replacement treatment in people receiving antifibrinolytic agents compared with placebo. The remaining primary outcome of need for re‐intervention was not reported by either trial. Two trials reported on 53 people with haemophilia A and B with inhibitors treated with different regimens of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) for haemostatic coverage of 33 major and 20 minor surgical interventions. Neither of the included trials specifically addressed any of the review's primary outcomes (mortality, blood loss and need for re‐intervention). In one trial a high‐dose rFVIIa regimen (90 μg/kg) was compared with a low‐dose regimen (35 μg/kg); the higher dose showed increased haemostatic efficacy, in particular in major surgery, with shorter duration of treatment, similar total dose of rFVIIa administered and similar safety levels. In the second trial, bolus infusion and continuous infusion of rFVIIa were compared, showing similar haemostatic efficacy, duration of treatment and safety. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to assess the most effective and safe haemostatic treatment to prevent bleeding in people with haemophilia or other congenital bleeding disorders undergoing surgical procedures. Ideally large, adequately powered, and well‐designed randomised controlled trials would be needed, in particular to address the cost‐effectiveness of such demanding treatments in the light of the increasing present economic constraints, and to explore the new challenge of ageing patients with haemophilia or other congenital bleeding disorders. However, performing such trials is always a complex task in this setting and presently does not appear to be a clinical and research priority. Indeed, major and minor surgeries are effectively and safely performed in these individuals in clinical practice, with the numerous national and international recommendations and guidelines providing regimens for treatment in this setting mainly based on data from observational, uncontrolled studies. Plain language summary Preventing bleeding in people with congenital bleeding disorders during and after surgery In haemophilia and other congenital bleeding disorders blood does not clot properly, which can cause excessive bleeding. This is particularly relevant during surgery, when the risk of bleeding depends on the type and severity of the clotting disorder and on the type of surgery. Therefore, during and after surgery, these individuals should receive treatment to improve the ability of their blood to clot and so prevent bleeding. Clotting factor concentrates (when available and appropriate in those individuals missing specific clotting proteins) or other non‐specific drugs for clotting, or a combination of both, are administered. It is not known what is the optimal dose or duration or method of administration of these treatments in these circumstances. We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy (mortality, blood loss, need for re‐intervention, subjective assessment of efficacy, duration and dose of therapy) and the safety of any type of treatment given to people with congenital bleeding disorders during any type of surgery. We found four trials to be included in this review. Two trials evaluated 59 people with haemophilia A or B receiving antifibrinolytic drugs (agents that reduce the breakdown of clots) or placebo in addition to the initial standard treatment before dental extractions. The remaining two trials evaluated 53 people with haemophilia A or B and inhibitors (antibodies that act against the factor concentrate therapy) receiving an different clotting concentrate, recombinant activated factor VII, both during and after surgery. These two trials evaluated different treatment options: high‐dose compared with low‐dose and a single large (bolus) infusion compared with continuous infusion. The trials included in this review provide some information in two specific situations in people with congenital bleeding disorders undergoing surgery. However, on the whole, there is not enough evidence from trials to define the best treatments for the various types of disease and types of surgery. Further trials would be useful to improve our knowledge but are difficult to carry out and currently do not appear to be a clinical priority. Indeed, both major and minor surgery are safely performed in clinical practice in these individuals based on local experience and data from uncontrolled studies.","2","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Surgical Procedures, Operative; *Tooth Extraction; Aminocaproic Acid [therapeutic use]; Antifibrinolytic Agents [*therapeutic use]; Blood Loss, Surgical [*prevention & control]; Factor VIIa [therapeutic use]; Hemophilia A [*drug therapy]; Hemophilia B [*drug therapy]; Hemostasis, Surgical [*methods]; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Recombinant Proteins [therapeutic use]; Tranexamic Acid [therapeutic use]","10.1002/14651858.CD009961.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009961.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD001916.PUB3","Anie, KA; Green, J","Psychological therapies for sickle cell disease and pain","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2015","Abstract - Background Sickle cell disease comprises a group of genetic blood disorders. It occurs when the sickle haemoglobin gene is inherited from both parents. The effects of the condition are: varying degrees of anaemia which, if severe, can reduce mobility; a tendency for small blood capillaries to become blocked causing pain in muscle and bone commonly known as 'crises'; damage to major organs such as the spleen, liver, kidneys, and lungs; and increased vulnerability to severe infections. There are both medical and non‐medical complications, and treatment is usually symptomatic and palliative in nature. Psychological interventions for individuals with sickle cell disease might complement current medical treatment, and studies of their efficacy have yielded encouraging results. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives To examine the evidence that psychological interventions improve the ability of people with sickle cell disease to cope with their condition. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and the Internet, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 17 February 2015. Selection criteria All randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing psychological interventions with no (psychological) intervention in people with sickle cell disease. Data collection and analysis Both authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. Main results Twelve studies were identified in the searches and seven of these were eligible for inclusion in the review. Five studies, involving 260 participants, provided data for analysis. One study showed that cognitive behaviour therapy significantly reduced the affective component of pain (feelings about pain), mean difference ‐0.99 (95% confidence interval ‐1.62 to ‐0.36), but not the sensory component (pain intensity), mean difference 0.00 (95% confidence interval ‐9.39 to 9.39). One study of family psycho‐education was not associated with a reduction in depression. Another study evaluating cognitive behavioural therapy had inconclusive results for the assessment of coping strategies, and showed no difference between groups assessed on health service utilisation. In addition, family home‐based cognitive behavioural therapy did not show any difference compared to disease education. One study of patient education on health beliefs showed a significant improvement in attitudes towards health workers, mean difference ‐4.39 (95% CI ‐6.45 to ‐2.33) and medication, mean difference ‐1.74 (95% CI ‐2.98 to ‐0.50). Nonetheless, these results may not apply across all ages, severity of sickle cell disease, types of pain (acute or chronic), or setting. Authors' conclusions Evidence for the efficacy of psychological therapies in sickle cell disease is currently limited. This systematic review has clearly identified the need for well‐designed, adequately‐powered, multicentre randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of specific interventions in sickle cell disease. Plain language summary Psychological therapies for sickle cell disease and pain Sickle cell disease is a group of blood disorders. It can cause anaemia, which if severe can reduce mobility. It may also allow small blood vessels to become blocked causing pain in muscle and bone and it can damage major organs such as the spleen, liver, kidneys, and lungs. People with sickle cell disease are more vulnerable to severe infections. Treatment is usually in response to symptoms and designed to ease pain. Psychological treatment to help people cope with sickle cell disease might complement current medical treatment. There are four types of treatment: patient education; cognitive therapy (to do with thoughts and feelings); behavioural therapy (to do with actions); psychodynamic psychotherapy (talking to relieve emotional pain). We searched for randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials which compared psychological treatments to each other or to no treatment in sickle cell disease. We included seven studies in the review, of which five, with 260 people, had data we could enter into the review. One study showed that cognitive behaviour therapy reduced the affective part of pain (feelings about pain), but not the sensory part (pain intensity). Another study of this therapy had inconclusive results for coping strategies and showed no difference on how different groups used the health service. A study using cognitive behavioural therapy with teenagers and their families at home did not show any difference when compared with education about sickle cell disease. One education study did not show a reduction in depression. Furthermore, one study in patient education helped improve attitudes to healthcare workers and medication use in adolescents and young adults. The authors believe that some patient education seems relevant for children, adolescents and young adults, while methods to improve the ability to cope in both children and adults are important. Nonetheless, these results may not apply to across all ages, clinical severity, types of pain (acute or chronic) that people with sickle cell disease have, or which country they live in. More research needs to be done in this area.","5","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Depression [psychology, therapy]; Hemoglobin SC Disease [*therapy]; Humans; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Pain Management [*methods]; Pain [psychology]; Psychotherapy [*methods]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD001916.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001916.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD001913","Lees, C; Davies, SC; Dezateux, C","Neonatal screening for sickle cell disease","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2000","Abstract - Background Sickle cell disease is an inherited disorder that occurs throughout the world with its highest incidence in areas of Africa where malaria is endemic. It affects up to 1 in 60 infants born in some areas of Africa. There are a number of potentially serious complications associated with the condition, and it is suggested that early treatment (before symptoms develop) can improve both morbidity and mortality. Screening for the condition in the neonatal period would enable early diagnosis and therefore early treatment. Objectives To assess whether there is evidence that neonatal screening for sickle cell disease rather than symptomatic diagnosis reduces adverse short‐ and long‐term outcomes for those in whom the disease is detected, without adverse outcomes in the population screened. Search methods We searched the Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group. Contact was made with experts in the field for any work as yet unpublished. Reference lists of published studies were also searched. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Trials Register: 09 April 2010. Selection criteria Any randomised or quasi‐randomised trial, published or unpublished comparing diagnosis by screening to clinical diagnosis would have been considered eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis No trials of neonatal screening for sickle cell disease were found. Main results No trials of neonatal screening for sickle cell disease were found. Authors' conclusions There is a lack of evidence from trials of neonatal screening for sickle cell disease. There is evidence of benefit from early treatment which is made possible by screening and there are a number of reviews and economic analyses of non‐trial literature suggesting that screening is appropriate. Healthcare providers must therefore assess whether the information provided by these documents is relevant to their practice and situation when making decisions regarding neonatal screening for sickle cell disease. Systematic reviews of early treatments or interventions, including penicillin prophylaxis, pneumococcal vaccine and parental education should be considered. There are no trials included in the review and we have not identified any relevant trials up to July 2008. We therefore do not plan to update this review until new trials are published. Plain language summary Testing newborn babies for sickle cell diseases Sickle cell diseases are inherited and affect mainly people of African origin. The red blood cells are abnormally (sickle) shaped, which can lead to life‐threatening complications. They are most likely to be fatal in the first few years of life since affected children are at higher risk of serious infections. Regular antibiotics and immunisations reduce the risk of infections, and if sickle status is known, can be started early. Screening babies allows early diagnosis and therefore early treatment. Screening may also have disadvantages. This review aims to assess whether screening compared to diagnosis from symptoms leads to less morbidity and mortality. The authors were not able to find trials that assessed the benefits and harms of screening. There is evidence that starting treatment early is of benefit. Early treatment is made possible by screening in the neonatal period. There are some reports in non‐trial literature which suggest that newborn screening is appropriate based on currently available evidence. Healthcare providers must assess whether these reports are relevant to their practice and situation when deciding whether to screen for SCD in the neonatal period. Practice recommendations could be made from the results of a prospective randomised controlled trial. Such a trial may be thought to be unethical given the proven benefit of early preventative treatment of children with penicillin. There are no trials included in the review and we have not identified any relevant trials up to July 2008. We therefore do not plan to update this review until new trials are published.","1","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Neonatal Screening; Anemia, Sickle Cell [*diagnosis]; Humans; Infant, Newborn","10.1002/14651858.CD001913","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001913","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Oral protein calorie supplements are used to improve nutritional status in these children. These expensive products may be associated with some adverse effects, e.g. the development of inappropriate eating behaviour patterns. This is a new update of a Cochrane review last updated in 2009. Objectives To examine evidence that in children with chronic disease, oral protein calorie supplements alter daily nutrient intake, nutritional indices, survival and quality of life and are associated with adverse effects, e.g. diarrhoea, vomiting, reduced appetite, glucose intolerance, bloating and eating behaviour problems. Search methods Trials of oral protein calorie supplements in children with chronic diseases were identified through comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Companies marketing these products were also contacted. Most recent search of the Group's Trials Register: 24 February 2015. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing oral protein calorie supplements for at least one month to increase calorie intake with existing conventional therapy (including advice on improving nutritional intake from food or no specific intervention) in children with chronic disease. Data collection and analysis We independently assessed the outcomes: indices of nutrition and growth; anthropometric measures of body composition; calorie and nutrient intake (total from oral protein calorie supplements and food); eating behaviour; compliance; quality of life; specific adverse effects; disease severity scores; and mortality; we also assessed the risk of bias in the included trials. Main results Four studies (187 children) met the inclusion criteria. Three studies were carried out in children with cystic fibrosis and one study included children with paediatric malignant disease. Overall there was a low risk of bias for blinding and incomplete outcome data.Two studies had a high risk of bias for allocation concealment. Few statistical differences were found in the outcomes we assessed between treatment and control groups, except change in total energy intake at six and 12 months, mean difference 304.86 kcal per day (95% confidence interval 5.62 to 604.10) and mean difference 265.70 kcal per day (95% confidence interval 42.94 to 485.46), respectively. However, these were based on the analysis of just 58 children in only one study. Only two chronic diseases were included in these analyses, cystic fibrosis and paediatric malignant disease. No other studies were identified which assessed the effectiveness of oral protein calorie supplements in children with other chronic diseases. Authors' conclusions Oral protein calorie supplements are widely used to improve the nutritional status of children with a number of chronic diseases. We identified a small number of studies assessing these products in children with cystic fibrosis and paediatric malignant disease, but were unable to draw any conclusions based on the limited data extracted. We recommend a series of large, randomised controlled trials be undertaken investigating the use of these products in children with different chronic diseases. Until further data are available, we suggest these products are used with caution. Plain language summary The use of oral protein calorie supplements in children with chronic disease Background A lack of growth and poor nutrition are common in children with chronic diseases like cystic fibrosis and paediatric cancer. This may be due to reduced appetite, poor absorption and the need for extra calories due to the disease. Oral protein calorie supplements, either as milk or juices, may improve nutritional status and help children gain weight. Side effects of taking these supplements include the risk that the protein and calories in the supplement end up replacing those from normal food and have a negative effect on eating behaviour and physical side effects (e.g. bloating, vomiting and diarrhoea). Search date The evidence is current to: 24 February 2015. Study characteristics We looked for trials of oral protein calorie supplements compared to usual treatment or no alternative treatment where the children took the supplements for at least one month. The review included four trials with 187 children; in three of these the children had cystic fibrosis and in one they had cancer. Studies lasted from three months to one year. We recorded the results and judged whether the trials were at risk of being biased based on the design or the way it was run. We looked at outcomes such as weight and height, calorie intake, behaviour and also side effects. Key results One study (with 58 children) showed increases in the total calories consumed at both six and 12 months. None of the other outcomes we looked at showed any difference between treatments. This is an updated version of the review, which found no conclusive evidence to support the use of oral protein supplements. We suggest that at least one high quality trial be conducted.Therefore, we suggest that these products are used sparingly and with caution. Quality of the evidence Overall the included studies had a low risk of bias, except for two studies in which it was possible that the organisers knew which treatment group in which the children would be placed. These issues are unlikely to change the results as knowing which treatment one receives is unlikely to affect the results of body measurements (e.g. weight, height outcomes). All planned outcomes were reported on, with the exception of one study that did not report on eating behaviour and lipase intake which were measured. The quality of the results for the eating behaviour assessment was questionable and many of the children did not return the food diaries from which the lipase intake could be calculated.","5","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Energy Intake; *Nutritional Status; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Chronic Disease; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Dietary Proteins [administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Dietary Supplements [*adverse effects]; Humans; Infant; Neoplasms [*complications]; Nutrition Disorders [etiology, *therapy]; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Survival Analysis","10.1002/14651858.CD001914.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001914.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

However, a consensus has yet to be reached on the most appropriate dietary treatment. Plant sterols are commonly used in FH although patients may know them by other names like phytosterols or stanols. Objectives To examine whether a cholesterol‐lowering diet is more effective in reducing ischaemic heart disease and lowering cholesterol than no dietary intervention in children and adults with familial hypercholesterolaemia. Further, to compare the efficacy of supplementing a cholesterol‐lowering diet with either omega‐3 fatty acids, soya proteins, plant sterols or plant stanols. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register, which is compiled from electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (updated with each new issue of  The Cochrane Library ), quarterly searches of MEDLINE and the prospective handsearching of one journal ‐  Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease.  Most recent search of the Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register: 22 August 2013. We also searched PubMed to 05 February 2012. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials, both published and unpublished, where a cholesterol‐lowering diet in children and adults with familial hypercholesterolaemia has been compared to other forms of dietary treatment or to no dietary intervention were included. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed the trial eligibility and risk of bias and one extracted the data, with independent verification of data extraction by a colleague. Main results In the 2014 update of the review, 15 trials have been included, with a total of 453 participants across seven comparison groups. The included trials had either a low or unclear risk of bias for most of the parameters used for risk assessment. Only short‐term outcomes could be assessed due to the short duration of follow up in the included trials. None of the primary outcomes, (incidence of ischaemic heart disease, number of deaths and age at death) were evaluated in any of the included trials. No significant differences were noted for the majority of secondary outcomes for any of the planned comparisons. However, a significant difference was found for the following comparisons and outcomes: for the comparison between plant sterols and cholesterol‐lowering diet (in favour of plant sterols), total cholesterol levels, mean difference 0.30 mmol/l (95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.48); decreased serum LDL cholesterol, mean difference ‐0.60 mmol/l (95% CI ‐0.89 to ‐0.31). Fasting serum HDL cholesterol levels were elevated, mean difference ‐0.04 mmol/l (95% CI ‐0.11 to 0.03) and serum triglyceride concentration was reduced, mean difference ‐0.03 mmol/l (95% CI ‐0.15 to ‐0.09), although these changes were not statistically significant. Similarly, guar gum when given as an add on therapy to bezafibrate reduced total cholesterol and LDL levels as compared to bezafibrate alone. Authors' conclusions No conclusions can be made about the effectiveness of a cholesterol‐lowering diet, or any of the other dietary interventions suggested for familial hypercholesterolaemia, for the primary outcomes: evidence and incidence of ischaemic heart disease, number of deaths and age at death,due to the lack of data on these. Large, parallel, randomised controlled trials are needed to investigate the effectiveness of a cholesterol‐lowering diet and the addition of omega‐3 fatty acids, plant sterols or stanols, soya protein, dietary fibers to a cholesterol‐lowering diet. Plain language summary Dietary modifications for managing familial hypercholesterolaemia Familial hypercholesterolaemia is an inherited disorder characterised by a raised blood cholesterol, and premature ischaemic heart disease. Changing diet is an important management option to reduce low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (the bad cholesterol) levels. Recently, certain lipid‐lowering drugs have shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of children with familial hypercholesterolaemia. However, dietary management remains important either on its own or combined with drug therapy. Several strategies are used to modify diet. This review aimed to compare cholesterol‐lowering dietary interventions either in combination with each other or alone. These interventions included adding omega‐3 fatty acids or plant sterols or plant stanols or soya proteins to diet. Fifteen trials were included in this updated review. The included trials had either a low or unclear risk of bias for most of the domains used for risk assessment. All the trials were short term and the majority were cross‐over in design. For most of the comparisons there was no significant difference in the various intervention strategies when compared to cholesterol‐lowering diet. However, for total cholesterol levels, serum low density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations, a significant benefit was obtained with plant sterols. However, before drawing any conclusions, methodological problems with pooling results from cross‐over trials should be considered. There is a need for long‐term trials with parallel group design to assess the potential benefits and harms of a cholesterol‐lowering diet.","6","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Diet, Fat‐Restricted; Adult; Child; Cross‐Over Studies; Fatty Acids, Omega‐3 [administration & dosage]; Humans; Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II [*diet therapy]; Phytosterols [administration & dosage]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Soybean Proteins [administration & dosage]","10.1002/14651858.CD001918.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001918.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Children with cystic fibrosis are prone to recurrent lung inflammation, bacterial colonisation and subsequent chronic airway disease, putting them at risk for severe respiratory syncytial virus infections requiring intensive care and respiratory support. No treatment currently exists, hence prevention is important. Palivizumab is effective in reducing respiratory syncytial virus hospitalisation rates and is recommended for prophylaxis in high‐risk children with other conditions. It is unclear if palivizumab can prevent respiratory syncytial virus hospitalisations and intensive care unit admissions in children with cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To determine the efficacy and safety of palivizumab (Synagis ® ) compared with placebo, no prophylaxis or other prophylaxis, in preventing hospitalisation and mortality from respiratory syncytial virus infection in children with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register and scanned references of the eligible study and related reviews. Date of last search: 05 May 2016. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised studies. Data collection and analysis The authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Main results One study (186 infants up to two years old) comparing five monthly doses of palivizumab (N = 92) to placebo (N = 94) over one respiratory syncytial virus season was identified and met our inclusion criteria. We judged there to be a low risk of bias with respect to the concealment of the randomization schedule (although it was not clear how this was generated) and to blinding of participants and study personnel. There is also a low risk of bias with regards to incomplete outcome data. However, we judged there to be a high risk of bias from selective reporting (summary statements presented but no data) and the fact that this industry‐supported study has not been published as a full report in a peer‐reviewed journal. At six months follow‐up, one participant in each group was hospitalised due to respiratory syncytial virus; there were no deaths in either group. In the palivizumab and placebo groups, 86 and 90 children experienced any adverse event, while five and four children had related adverse events respectively. Nineteeen children receiving palivizumab and 16 receiving placebo suffered serious adverse events; one participant receiving palivizumab discontinued due to this. At 12 months follow‐up, there were no significant differences between groups in number of  Pseudomonas  bacterial colonisations or change in weight‐to‐height ratio. Authors' conclusions We identified one randomised controlled trial comparing five monthly doses of palivizumab to placebo in infants up to two years old with cystic fibrosis. While the overall incidence of adverse events was similar in both groups, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions on the safety and tolerability of respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis with palivizumab in infants with cystic fibrosis. Six months after treatment, the authors reported no clinically meaningful differences in outcomes. Additional randomised studies are needed to establish the safety and efficacy of palivizumab in children with cystic fibrosis. Plain language summary Palivizumab vaccine for prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infection in children with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effects of vaccinating children with cystic fibrosis with palivizumab to prevent respiratory syncytial virus. Background Respiratory syncytial virus commonly causes lung infections in infants and children. Although cases are not severe in most children, children with cystic fibrosis may be at higher risk for severe lung infections from the virus. During a respiratory virus season, children with cystic fibrosis are more likely to need admitting to hospital and to experience a deterioration in lung function, compared with children who don't have cystic fibrosis. Palivizumab (Synagis ® ) is a vaccine which has been shown to reduce hospitalisation rates due to respiratory syncytial virus in some high risk populations. Palivizumab is administered once a month for five months, beginning before the respiratory syncytial virus season each year. It is not yet known how effective and safe this vaccine is in children with cystic fibrosis. We looked for randomised controlled trials (trials where children are put into different treatment groups at random and then compared to each other) where palivizumab vaccinations were compared to either another preventive therapy or no preventive therapy in children with cystic fibrosis. Search date The evidence is current to: 05 May 2016. Study characteristics We found one study with 186 participants (infants with cystic fibrosis up to two years of age) which was run across 40 centres in the USA. Key results One infant (out of 92) who received palivizumab and one infant (out of 94) who received placebo were admitted to hospital due to infection from respiratory syncytial virus. No infants died. Overall, the number of adverse events in the palivizumab group was similar to that in the placebo group. No serious adverse events were reported to be related to the vaccine. Over the longer term (12 months), weight gain and the number of infections with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  (a common bacterial infection in cystic fibrosis) were similar between groups. The limitation of all these findings is that we only identified one study. More research is needed on the use of the palivizumab vaccination in children with cystic fibrosis. Quality of the evidence We thought there was a low risk that it would be know which treatment group the next participant would be put into, although it was not clear how this order was generated. We also thought that participants and study personnel were sufficiently blinded to the treatment to avoid bias and that any missing data were unlikely to bias the study results. However, we did have concerns about bias from selective reporting (summary statements were presented but without any data) and the fact that this industry‐supported study has not been published as a full report in a peer‐reviewed journal.","7","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Antiviral Agents [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Drug Administration Schedule; Humans; Infant; Palivizumab [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Pseudomonas Infections [epidemiology]; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections [*drug therapy]","10.1002/14651858.CD007743.pub6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007743.pub6","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To determine whether home intravenous antibiotic therapy in cystic fibrosis is as effective as inpatient intravenous antibiotic therapy and if it is preferred by individuals or families or both. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Most recent search of the Group's Trials Register: 23 November 2015. Selection criteria Randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled studies of intravenous antibiotic treatment for adults and children with cystic fibrosis at home compared to in hospital. Data collection and analysis The authors independently selected studies for inclusion in the review, assessed methodological quality of each study and extracted data using a standardised form. Main results Eighteen studies were identified by the searches. Only one study could be included which reported results from 17 participants aged 10 to 41 years with an infective exacerbation of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa . All their 31 admissions (18 hospital and 13 at home after two to four days of hospital treatment) were analysed as independent events. Outcomes were measured at 0, 10 and 21 days after initiation of treatment. Home participants underwent fewer investigations than hospital participants (P < 0.002) and general activity was higher in the home group. No significant differences were found for clinical outcomes, adverse events, complications or change of intravenous lines,or time to next admission. Home participants received less low‐dose home maintenance antibiotic. Quality of life measures showed no significant differences for dyspnoea and emotional state, but fatigue and mastery were worse for home participants, possibly due to a higher general activity and need of support. Personal, family, sleeping and eating disruptions were less important for home than hospital admissions. Home therapy was cheaper for families and the hospital. Indirect costs were not determined. Authors' conclusions Current evidence is restricted to a single randomized clinical trial. It suggests that, in the short term, home therapy does not harm individuals, entails fewer investigations, reduces social disruptions and can be cost‐effective. There were both advantages and disadvantages in terms of quality of life. The decision to attempt home treatment should be based on the individual situation and appropriate local resources. More research is urgently required. Plain language summary Intravenous antibiotics given at home for people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of giving antibiotics at home to people with cystic fibrosis. Background Cystic fibrosis is a serious genetic disease linked to recurrent lung infections. As a result of these infections, the person's lung disease becomes progressively worse. Lung infections are often treated with intravenous antibiotics (given directly into a vein) in hospital for a number of weeks. This is costly and disrupts the life of people with cystic fibrosis. Treatment can be given at home if patients and their carers are given enough training and support. We looked for randomised controlled trials which compared intravenous antibiotic treatment in hospital with treatment at home. This is an update of a previously published review. Search date The evidence is current to: 23 November 2015. Study characteristics We found one study with 17 people aged 10 to 41 years who had a flare up of infection with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa . The people taking part were assigned to either home antibiotics or hospital antibiotics at random. Those who had home antibiotics initially spent up to four days in hospital and were taught to prepare and administer their own intravenous antibiotics. They were discharged with enough medication and equipment for the course of treatment and were visited at home. All participants received the same type of antibiotic and the course lasted at least 10 days. Key results There were no differences found for clinical outcomes, adverse events, or complications linked to intravenous treatment. People at home were more tired and found the treatment more difficult to master. This may be due to them being more active and needing more support. Home therapy was cheaper for families and the hospital. There were no details about indirect costs. We conclude that treatment at home does not harm people in the short term and does reduce social disruption. However, the decision in favour of this option must be made on an individual basis. Quality of the evidence The evidence is very limited and more research is strongly needed to recommend its use.","12","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adolescent; Adult; Anti-Bacterial Agents [*administration & dosage]; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Home Care Services [*economics]; Hospitalization [*economics]; Humans; Injections, Intravenous; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Tract Infections [*drug therapy, etiology]; Self Care; Staphylococcal Infections [*drug therapy]; Staphylococcus aureus","10.1002/14651858.CD001917.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001917.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Objectives To determine whether topical CFTR gene replacement therapy to the lungs in people with cystic fibrosis is associated with improvements in clinical outcomes, and to assess any adverse effects. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of most recent search: 05 May 2016. An additional search of the  National Institutes for Health (NIH) Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System (GeMCRIS)  was also performed for the years 1992 to 2015. Date of most recent search: 20 April 2016. Selection criteria Randomised controlled studies comparing topical CFTR gene delivery to the lung, using either viral or non‐viral delivery systems, with placebo or an alternative delivery system in people with confirmed cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis The authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality. Authors of included studies were contacted and asked for any available additional data. Meta‐analysis was limited due to differing study designs. Main results Four randomised controlled studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, involving a total of 302 participants lasting from 29 days to 13 months; 14 studies were excluded. The included studies differed in terms of CFTR gene replacement agent and study design, which limited the meta‐analysis. One study only enrolled adult males, the remaining studies included both males and females aged 12 years and over. Risk of bias in the studies was moderate. Random sequence generation and allocation concealment was only described in the more recent study; the remaining three studies were judged to have an unclear risk of bias. All four studies documented double‐blinding to the intervention, but there is some uncertainty with regards to participant blinding in one study. Some outcome data were missing from all four studies. There were no differences in either the number of respiratory exacerbations or the number of participants with an exacerbation between replacement therapy or placebo groups at any time point. Meta‐analysis of most respiratory function tests showed no difference between treatment and placebo groups, but the smallest study (n = 16) reported forced vital capacity (litres) increased more in the placebo group at up to 24 hours. A further study reported a significant improvement in forced expiratory volume at one second (litres) at 30 days after participants had received their first dose of favouring the gene therapy agent, but this finding was not confirmed when combined with at second study in the meta‐analysis. The more recent study (n = 140) demonstrated a small improvement in forced vital capacity (per cent predicted) at two and three months and again at 11 and 12 months for participants receiving CFTR gene replacement therapy compared to those receiving placebo. The same study reported a significant difference in the relative change in forced expiratory volume at one second (per cent predicted) at two months, three months and 12 months. One small study reported significant concerns with ""influenza‐like"" symptoms in participants treated with CFTR gene replacement therapy; this was not reported on repeated use of the same agent in a larger recent study. There was no other evidence of positive impact on outcomes, in particular improved quality of life or reduced treatment burden. Two studies measured ion transport in the lower airways; one (n = 16) demonstrated significant changes toward normal values in the participants who received gene transfer agents (P < 0.0001), mean difference 6.86 (95% confidence interval 3.77 to 9.95). The second study (n = 140) also reported significant changes toward normal values (P = 0.032); however, aggregate data were not available for analysis. In the most recent study, there was also evidence of increased salt transport in cells obtained by brushing the lower airway. These outcomes, whilst important, are not of direct clinical relevance. Authors' conclusions One study of liposome‐based CFTR gene transfer therapy demonstrated some improvements in respiratory function in people with CF, but this limited evidence of efficacy does not support this treatment as a routine therapy at present. There was no evidence of efficacy for viral‐mediated gene delivery. Future studies need to investigate clinically important outcome measures. Plain language summary Replacing the defective gene is a potential treatment for progressive lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of delivering the correct copy of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene directly to the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis in order to treat progressive lung disease. Background In cystic fibrosis the gene encoding a protein called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is faulty. People with cystic fibrosis suffer from progressive lung infection and damage which reduces life expectancy. Agents which can deliver a correct copy of the faulty CFTR gene to cells in the lungs may be an effective treatment. Search date The evidence is current to: 20 April 2016. Study characteristics We found four studies with 302 people to include in this review. The studies lasted from 29 days to 13 months. Three of these studies included both men and women aged 12 years and over and one study only included adult men. The studies compare gene therapy to a dummy treatment (placebo) both of which are inhaled as a mist into the lungs. The studies were of different designs and used different agents. This meant we could not combine their results. Key results Three of the studies, including the largest and most recent study, showed an improvement in some measures of lung function in people with CF given gene therapy. We did not find that any more clinically relevant outcomes such as quality of life, treatment burden or flare‐up of lung disease had improved with treatment. In one study ""influenza‐like"" symptoms were more common in people who received CFTR gene transfer agents but this was not reported when the agent was used repeatedly in a larger study. In those people who took the gene transfer agents, molecules and salt in their lower airways moved more like they do in healthy people. The limited evidence of benefit does not support this as a routine therapy at present. We recommend that future studies are designed and reported clearly so that their results can be incorporated into a systematic review. Quality of the evidence The most recent study provided detailed information on how the people were put into different treatment groups completely at random, and so we are satisfied that those taking part in the study had an equal chance of being in either group (CFTR gene transfer agent or placebo) and that no one could work out which group the next person would be put into. The other studies reported that people were put into groups at random but did not specify how, so we cannot be sure that there was an equal chance of them being in either group. We believe that the clinicians running all the studies did not know which treatment the people taking part were receiving and that in three of the studies those taking part did not know either, but we could not be sure whether the people taking part in the latest study knew which treatment they were receiving and what effect this knowledge might have on results. Unfortunately, the studies did not report all their results clearly; sometimes results were not reported in a way that we could use for the review and sometimes they were not reported at all. This reduced the certainty with which we judged the overall results.","6","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adolescent; Adult; Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator [*genetics, therapeutic use]; Cystic Fibrosis [genetics, *therapy]; Female; Gene Transfer Techniques; Genetic Therapy [adverse effects, methods]; Humans; Liposomes; Male; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Function Tests; Targeted Gene Repair [adverse effects, *methods]","10.1002/14651858.CD005599.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD005599.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

It is a multisystem disorder caused by a mutation in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein which is important in producing sweat, digestive juices and mucus.The impaired or absent function of this protein results in the production of viscous mucus within the lungs and an environment that is susceptible to chronic airway obstruction and pulmonary colonization by a range of pathogenic bacteria. Morbidity and mortality of cystic fibrosis is related to chronic pulmonary sepsis and its complications by these bacteria. Influenza can worsen the course of the disease in cystic fibrosis by increasing the risk of pneumonia and secondary respiratory complications. Antiviral agents form an important part of influenza management and include the neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir. These inhibitors can limit the infection and prevent the spread of the virus. Objectives To assess the effects of neuraminidase inhibitors for the treatment of influenza infection in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Most recent search: 02 November 2015. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing neuraminidase inhibitors with placebo or other antiviral drugs. Data collection and analysis Two review authors had planned to independently screen studies, extract data and assess risk of bias using standard Cochrane methodologies. No studies were identified for inclusion. Main results No relevant studies were retrieved after a comprehensive search of the literature. Authors' conclusions We were unable to identify any randomised controlled studies or quasi‐randomised controlled studies on the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors for the treatment of influenza infection in people with cystic fibrosis. The absence of high level evidence for the effectiveness of these interventions emphasises the need for well‐designed, adequately powered, randomised controlled clinical studies. Plain language summary Antiviral treatment for influenza infection in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We looked for evidence for the use of antiviral treatment against influenza infection in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Cystic fibrosis is a genetic, life‐threatening disorder which affects many organs in the body. and people with cystic fibrosis have a higher risk of chronic lung disease. Influenza can worsen the course of the disease in cystic fibrosis by increasing the risk of pneumonia and secondary respiratory complications. During a pandemic (an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people), flu symptoms may be more severe and complications more frequent. Severe cases of pandemic flu have occurred in people with underlying chronic conditions including people with cystic fibrosis. Although there is no evidence that people with cystic fibrosis are more likely to contract this infection than healthy people, the impact for them could be greater and the outcome worse as the lower airways are more often affected. Antiviral agents are important in managing influenza and include the neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir. These drugs can limit the infection and prevent the spread of the virus. Search date The evidence is current to: 02 November 2015. Study characteristics We did not find any studies looking at the use of neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza in people with cystic fibrosis. Key results Limited data from previous studies have shown that these drugs can be effective in healthy people and may be useful in high‐risk populations if used rationally. However, we are not able to answer the question of the safety and effectiveness of neuraminidase inhibitors for treating influenza in people with cystic fibrosis.","2","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Enzyme Inhibitors [*therapeutic use]; Humans; Influenza, Human [*drug therapy]; Neuraminidase [*antagonists & inhibitors]","10.1002/14651858.CD008139.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008139.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Although self‐management education interventions have been developed for cystic fibrosis, no previous systematic review of the evidence of effectiveness of these interventions has been conducted. Objectives To assess the effects of self‐management education interventions on improving health outcomes for patients with cystic fibrosis and their caregivers Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register (date of the last search: 22 August 2013). We also searched databases through EBSCO (CINAHL; Psychological and Behavioural Sciences Collection; PsychInfo; SocINDEX) and Elsevier (Embase) and handsearched relevant journals and conference proceedings (date of the last searches: 01 February 2014 ). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials, quasi‐randomised controlled trials or controlled clinical trials comparing different types of self‐management education for cystic fibrosis or comparing self‐management education with standard care or no intervention. Data collection and analysis Two authors assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias. Three authors extracted data. Main results Four trials (involving a total of 269 participants) were included. The participants were children with cystic fibrosis and their parents or caregivers in three trials and adults with cystic fibrosis in one trial. The trials compared four different self‐management education interventions versus standard treatment: (1) a training programme for managing cystic fibrosis in general; (2) education specific to aerosol and airway clearance treatments; (3) disease‐specific nutrition education; and (4) general and disease‐specific nutrition education. Training children to manage cystic fibrosis in general had no statistically significant effects on weight after six to eight weeks, mean difference ‐7.74 lb (i.e. 3.51 kg) (95% confidence interval ‐35.18 to 19.70). General and disease‐specific nutrition education for adults had no statistically significant effects on: pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume at one second), mean difference ‐5.00 % (95% confidence interval ‐18.10 to 8.10) at six months and mean difference ‐5.50 % (95% confidence interval ‐18.46 to 7.46) at 12 months; or weight, mean difference ‐ 0.70 kg (95% confidence interval ‐6.58 to 5.18) at six months and mean difference ‐0.70 kg (95% confidence interval ‐6.62 to 5.22) at 12 months; or dietary fat intake scores, mean difference 1.60 (85% confidence interval ‐2.90 to 6.10) at six months and mean difference 0.20 (95% confidence interval ‐4.08 to 4.48) at 12 months. There is some limited evidence to suggest that self‐management education may improve knowledge in patients with cystic fibrosis but not in parents or caregivers. There is also some limited evidence to suggest that self‐management education may result in positively changing a small number of behaviours in both patients and caregivers. Authors' conclusions The available evidence from this review is of insufficient quantity and quality to draw any firm conclusions about the effects of self‐management education for cystic fibrosis. Further trials are needed to investigate the effects of self‐management education on a range of clinical and behavioural outcomes in children, adolescents and adults with cystic fibrosis and their caregivers. Plain language summary Self‐management education for cystic fibrosis We set out to review the effects of self‐management education for cystic fibrosis on a range of health outcomes in individuals of all ages with cystic fibrosis and their caregivers. Our search for available evidence identified four trials, and all four compared a form of self‐management education to standard treatment. The precise focus of self management differed between trials and included a training programme for managing cystic fibrosis, education on chest treatments, education on nutrition specific to cystic fibrosis, and education on general and disease‐specific nutrition. Self‐management education had no positive effects on lung function, weight, or intake of fatty food. There is some evidence to suggest that self‐management education improves knowledge about cystic fibrosis and its management in patients with this condition and some self‐management behaviours in patients and caregivers. However, due to the small number of trials in this review, and because of concerns about the quality of these trials, we are unable to reach any firm conclusions about the effects of self‐management education for cystic fibrosis. We recommend that further trials are conducted to evaluate the effects of self‐management education interventions.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Nutrition Therapy; *Self Care; Adolescent; Adult; Caregivers [education]; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*therapy]; Humans; Parents [education]; Patient Education as Topic [*methods]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Young Adult","10.1002/14651858.CD007641.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007641.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Sickle cell crises in which irregular and dehydrated cells contribute to blocking of blood vessels are characterised by episodes of pain. Treatment is mainly supportive and symptomatic.  In vitro  studies with piracetam indicate that it has the potential for inhibition and a reversal of the process of sickling of erythrocytes. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane review. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of piracetam for reducing the incidence of painful sickle cell disease crises. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Last search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 21 September 2015. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing orally administered piracetam to placebo or standard care in people, of all ages and both sexes, with sickle cell disease. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Trial authors were contacted for additional information. Adverse effects data were collected from the trials. Main results Three trials involving 169 participants were included in the review. A limited amount of data addressing some of the primary and some of the secondary outcomes were provided, but data were incomplete and based on un‐validated assumptions used in the evaluation of outcomes. One trial reported a reduction in the number of pain crises and their severity with active intervention than placebo but presented no data to confirm these results. A second trial presented a monthly global pain score based on the number of sickle cell crises and severity of pain but included no separate data for these primary outcomes. Although there was no significant difference between the piracetam and placebo periods for the number of days of hospitalisation (P = 0.87) in one trial, inconsistencies in the criteria necessary for hospitalisation during sickle crises did not permit accurate conclusions to be drawn. Two of the trials reported participant satisfaction with piracetam but provided no details as to how this satisfaction had been assessed. There were no reports of toxicity or adverse effects with piracetam other than one participant who experienced dizziness. Authors' conclusions The small number of included trials and their poor methodological quality provided insufficient reliable evidence to support the routine use of this medication for preventing the incidence of painful sickle cell disease crises. We will continue to run searches to identify any potentially relevant trials; however, we do not plan to update other sections of the review until new trials are published. Plain language summary Piracetam for reducing the incidence of painful sickle cell disease crises Review question We reviewed the evidence to assess the effectiveness of piracetam for reducing the incidence of painful sickle cell disease crises. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane review. Background Sickle cell disease is one of the most common genetic disorders and affects about 250 million people (5% of the world's population). It is characterised by sickle‐shaped red blood cells which may block blood vessels. This can lead to pain and damage to the major organs such as the brain, liver and spleen. Standard care is mainly supportive and in response to symptoms. Pain is controlled with drugs for pain relief and fluids to improve fluid levels. In vitro studies with piracetam have shown that it hinders the bonding of sickle haemoglobin and the bunching together of platelets. It also makes the blood less sticky and red blood cells more flexible. Search date The evidence is current to: 21 September 2015. Key results The authors of the review identified three trials, two of which had a cross‐over design. The quality of the trials was poor. There were wide differences in the people taking part, the drug dose and the outcomes measured. Three trials are included. They provide some weak and unreliable evidence that piracetam prevents painful sickle cell crises. This lack of reliable evidence illustrates some of the doubt and lack of support for the routine use of this treatment for reducing the incidence of painful sickle cell disease crises. The review authors conclude that future research should aim to provide evidence for people to make informed decisions about whether piracetam is of use. Further randomised controlled trials should be well‐designed and reported according to the 'Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)' statement. We will continue to run searches to identify any potentially relevant trials; however, we do not plan to update other sections of the review until new trials are published.","2","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adolescent; Anemia, Sickle Cell [complications, *drug therapy]; Antisickling Agents [*therapeutic use]; Child; Child, Preschool; Humans; Pain [*drug therapy]; Piracetam [*therapeutic use]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD006111.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006111.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register using the terms 'physiotherapy and exercise'. Date of the most recent search: 05 December 2013. Additionally, we conducted searches of the electronic databases MEDLINE, CINAHL (Ebscohost), PsycINFO (OvidSP) and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro). We also searched for potentially relevant, completed but unpublished studies, on several clinical trials registers. Date of the most recent searches: 10 September 2012. Selection criteria All randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled studies which investigated strategies designed to promote increased participation in daily physical activity for individuals with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus, or in arbitration with a third author. Main results Four studies (199 participants) met the inclusion criteria and were predominantly conducted in children with cystic fibrosis. Only one study had a combined cohort of adult and paediatric participants. The description of study methods was inadequate to assess the risk of bias, particularly with regard to blinding of assessors and selective reporting. One study was conducted in an inpatient setting with follow up in the outpatient setting; while the remaining three studies were conducted in individuals with stable respiratory disease in the outpatient setting. All included studies used exercise training to promote participation in physical activity, with the duration of the intervention period ranging from 18 days to three years. No improvement in physical activity participation was reported with any intervention period less than or equal to six months. Improvements in physical activity participation were only seen where follow up occurred beyond 12 months. There was no significant impact on quality of life from any of the intervention strategies. Authors' conclusions Although participation in physical activity is generally regarded as beneficial for people with cystic fibrosis, there is a lack of evidence regarding strategies to promote the uptake and the continued participation in physical activity for this population. This review provides very limited evidence that activity counselling and exercise advice, undertaken over at least six months, to engage in a home exercise programme may result in improved physical activity participation in people with cystic fibrosis. Further research is needed to determine the effect of strategies such as health coaching or telemedicine applications, in promoting the uptake and adherence to regular participation in physical activity. In addition, establishing the ideal duration of any interventions that promote physical activity, including exercise training programmes, will be important in addressing issues relating to participation in physical activity for people with cystic fibrosis. Plain language summary Strategies to promote participation in physical activity for people with cystic fibrosis Physical activity refers to any movement of the body generated by the muscles and which burns energy. Physical activity includes exercise, but also includes activity as a part of work, chores or transport. Participation in regular physical activity is important for health and well‐being. For most people with cystic fibrosis, physical activity and exercise are routinely recommended, but participation in prescribed programmes is often poor. The best way to encourage people with cystic fibrosis to do more physical activity during their day is unclear. This review aimed to evaluate the strategies that encourage people with cystic fibrosis to participate in daily physical activity. There were four included studies with a total of 199 participants which investigated the effect of exercise training on participation in physical activity. These were mostly conducted in children. The study methods and results were not clearly reported, so it was difficult to tell if the results were influenced by the way in which participants were assessed, or the nature of the outcomes reported. The training programmes ranged from 18 days to three years. In two studies the exercise training programmes were supervised and in two studies they were unsupervised and home‐based. Due to differences in the study design and the outcomes measured, we could not combine data from different studies. None of the studies reported any improvement in participation in physical activity when the exercise training lasted less than six months. There was very limited evidence that using a home‐exercise programme, for at least six months after receiving activity counselling and exercise advice, improved participation in physical activity in people with cystic fibrosis. No training program showed significant effects on quality of life.

Current treatment involves enzyme replacement therapy (with recombinant human alglucosidase alfa) and symptomatic therapies (e.g. to control secretions). Children who are cross‐reactive immunological material (CRIM)‐negative require immunomodulation prior to commencing enzyme replacement therapy. Enzyme replacement therapy was developed as the most promising therapeutic approach for Pompe disease; however, the evidence is lacking, especially regarding the optimal dose and dose frequency. Objectives To assess the effectiveness, safety and appropriate dose regimen of enzyme replacement therapy for treating infantile‐onset Pompe disease. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register, which is compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Embase (Ovid), PubMed and LILACS, and CBM, CNKI, VIP, and WANFANG for literature published in Chinese. In addition, we searched three online registers: WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ClinicalTrials.gov, and www.genzymeclinicalresearch.com. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search of the Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register: 24 November 2016. Selection criteria Randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials of enzyme replacement therapy in children with infantile‐onset Pompe disease. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected relevant trials, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted investigators to obtain important missing information. Main results We found no trials comparing the effectiveness and safety of enzyme replacement therapy to another intervention, no intervention or placebo. We found one trial (18 participants) that fulfilled the selection criteria, comparing different doses of alglucosidase alfa. The trial provided low‐quality evidence (this was a small trial, there were no numerical results available by dose group, random sequence generation and allocation concealment were unclear, and there was a lack of blinding). The duration of alglucosidase alfa treatment ranged from 52 weeks (the length of the original study) to up to three years (including the extended phase of the trial), with a median duration of treatment being 2.3 years. The trial only reported that clinical responses including cardiac function and motor development, as well as the proportion of children that were free of invasive ventilation, were similar in the 20 mg/kg every two weeks and the 40 mg/kg every two weeks groups (low‐quality evidence). Long‐term alglucosidase alfa treatment markedly extended survival as well as ventilation‐free survival and improved cardiomyopathy (low‐quality evidence). In relation to the number of children experiencing one or more infusion‐related events, there was no significant difference between dose groups, risk ratio 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.40 to 1.76) (low‐quality of evidence). However, of note, at 52 weeks, five children in the 20 mg/kg every two weeks dose group experienced a total of 41 mild or moderate (none severe) infusion‐related events and the six children in the 40 mg/kg every two weeks dose group experienced a total of 123 infusion‐related events. By the end of the extended phase of the trial, five children in the 20 mg/kg every two weeks dose group experienced a total of 47 infusion‐related events and the six children in the 40 mg/kg every two weeks dose group experienced a total of 177 infusion‐related events. The trial was supported by the Genzyme Corporation. Authors' conclusions The search found no trials comparing the effectiveness and safety of enzyme replacement therapy to another intervention, no intervention or placebo. One small randomized controlled trial provided no robust evidence for which dosing schedule of alglucosidase alfa was more effective to treat infantile‐onset Pompe disease. It is not deemed ethical to proceed with new placebo‐controlled trials, therefore a randomized controlled trial with a large sample size comparing different dosing schedules of enzyme replacement therapy is needed. The main clinical outcomes (i.e. cardiac function, invasive ventilation, survival, motor development, adverse events (e.g. the development of antibodies)) should be standardized when evaluated and reported. Plain language summary Enzyme replacement therapies for infantile‐onset Pompe disease Background Pompe disease was the first identified lysosomal storage disorder (inherited metabolic diseases that are characterized by an abnormal build‐up of various toxic materials in the body's cells). It causes damage to muscle by the accumulation of glycogen (which is used as an energy source by the body) within the lysosome due to deficiency of an enzyme called acid alpha‐glucosidase (GAA). There is a broad spectrum of Pompe disease types with infantile‐onset (starting during childhood) being the most severe. The usual presenting features of the infantile form are worsening weakness of the heart, muscles used in breathing and skeletal muscle. The tongue and the liver may be enlarged. This review aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of enzyme replacement therapy in children with infantile‐onset Pompe disease. Search date The evidence is current to 24 November 2016. Study characteristics We searched medical databases for clinical trials of enzyme replacement therapy in children with Pompe disease. We found no randomised trials (where people taking part in the trial have equal chances of being in the treatment or the control group) comparing the effectiveness and safety of enzyme replacement therapy to another intervention, no intervention or placebo (a 'dummy' drug). We found one trial (18 children) that compared two doses of recombinant human alglucosidase alfa (an enzyme replacement therapy): 20 mg/kg every two weeks (low dose) and 40 mg/kg every two weeks (high dose). The duration of treatment ranged from 52 weeks (the length of the original study) to up to three years (including the extension phase of the study), with a median (the middle number) duration of treatment being 2.3 years. Key results There were very limited numerical results available by dose group, the trial showed no evidence in favour of a high dose as opposed to a low dose. It described that the clinical responses including cardiac function, motor development (development of a child's muscles and their ability to move around and manipulate their environment), as well as the proportion of children that were free of invasive ventilation,were similar in the two groups (low‐quality evidence). Long‐term alglucosidase alfa treatment markedly extended survival as well as ventilation‐free survival (time without requiring a machine to help with breathing) and improved cardiomyopathy (heart disease) (low‐quality evidence). In relation to the number of children experiencing one or more infusion‐related events, there was no significant difference between the different dose groups (low‐quality evidence), although, of note, at 52 weeks, five children in the low‐dose group experienced a total of 41 mild or moderate (none were severe) infusion‐related events and the six children in the high dose‐group experienced a total of 123 infusion‐related events. By the end of the extension phase, five children in the low‐dose group experienced a total of 47 infusion‐related events and the six children in the high‐dose group experienced a total of 177 infusion‐related events. New trials should be undertaken with adequate number of participants to detect effectiveness and safety at different doses of alglucosidase alfa. The main clinical outcomes (i.e. cardiac function, time to ventilation, survival, motor development and side effects) should be standardized when evaluated and reported. Quality of the evidence The evidence that this small trial provided to the review was of low quality. The trial was supported by the Genzyme Corporation.","11","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Child Development; Enzyme Replacement Therapy [adverse effects, *methods]; Glycogen Storage Disease Type II [*drug therapy]; Humans; Infant; Recombinant Proteins [adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Respiration, Artificial [statistics & numerical data]; alpha‐Glucosidases [*administration & dosage, adverse effects, deficiency]","10.1002/14651858.CD011539.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011539.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD000222.PUB4","Cheng, K; Ashby, D; Smyth, RL","Ursodeoxycholic acid for cystic fibrosis‐related liver disease","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2017","Abstract - Background Abnormal biliary secretion leads to the thickening of bile and the formation of plugs within the bile ducts; the consequent obstruction and abnormal bile flow ultimately results in the development of cystic fibrosis‐related liver disease. This condition peaks in adolescence with up to 20% of adolescents with cystic fibrosis developing chronic liver disease. Early changes in the liver may ultimately result in end‐stage liver disease with people needing transplantation. One therapeutic option currently used is ursodeoxycholic acid. This is an update of a previous review. Objectives To analyse evidence that ursodeoxycholic acid improves indices of liver function, reduces the risk of developing chronic liver disease and improves outcomes in general in cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane CF and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also contacted drug companies and searched online trial registries. Date of the most recent search of the Group's trials register: 09 April 2017. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of the use of ursodeoxycholic acid for at least three months compared with placebo or no additional treatment in people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality. The authors used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. Main results Twelve trials have been identified, of which four trials involving 137 participants were included; data were only available from three of the trials (118 participants) since one cross‐over trial did not report appropriate data. The dose of ursodeoxycholic acid ranged from 10 to 20 mg/kg/day for up to 12 months. The complex design used in two trials meant that data could only be analysed for subsets of participants. There was no significant difference in weight change, mean difference ‐0.90 kg (95% confidence interval ‐1.94 to 0.14) based on 30 participants from two trials. Improvement in biliary excretion was reported in only one trial and no significant change after treatment was shown. There were no data available for analysis for long‐term outcomes such as death or need for liver transplantation. Authors' conclusions There are few trials assessing the effectiveness of ursodeoxycholic acid. The quality of the evidence identified ranged from low to very low. There is currently insufficient evidence to justify its routine use in cystic fibrosis. Plain language summary Ursodeoxycholic acid for liver disease related to cystic fibrosis Review question Does ursodeoxycholic acid improve measures of liver function, reduce the risk of developing chronic liver disease and improve outcomes in general in people with cystic fibrosis? Background Problems with the consistency of bile (thickened) and how it flows cause liver disease in up to 20% of young people with cystic fibrosis. Bile ducts can become blocked and cause cirrhosis in one or more parts of the liver. Ursodeoxycholic acid is a naturally occurring bile acid which is taken as either a tablet or liquid to try and prevent liver disease in people with cystic fibrosis. The best response seems to be from a total dose of 20 mg/kg/day in two to three separate doses and given initially for several months but possibly indefinitely. Originally it was used to treat gallstones, but over the last few years it has been used to treat and prevent the progression of cystic fibrosis‐related liver disease. This is an updated version of the review. Search date We last searched for evidence on 09 April 2017. Study characteristics We searched for trials of ursodeoxycholic acid lasting for at least three months and were able to include four trials, but data for analysis were only available from three of these. There are data from 118 participants aged between four and 32 years in this review. The dose of the drug given in the three trials with data ranged from 10 to 20 mg/kg/day. Two of these trials compared ursodeoxycholic acid to tablets with no medicine in them (placebo) and the third trial compared ursodeoxycholic acid to 'usual' treatment. The complex design of two trials meant data could not be analysed for all the participants. The trials lasted for up to 12 months, but no longer; however, one trial did report some follow‐up data after nine years. Key results Not many of the outcomes we listed in our review were assessed; only weight gain, skinfold thickness and biliary excretion. There were no real differences between treatments for any of these outcomes. Long‐term outcomes that we think are important, such as death or the need for liver transplant, were only reported in the follow‐up of one trial and the information did not tell us if the people who died or needed a liver transplant had received ursodeoxycholic acid or placebo. Current research shows that side effects of this treatment are rare, but there is not enough information about using it in the long‐term to justify routinely giving it to people with cystic fibrosis. As there is no other treatment to prevent liver disease, more research on ursodeoxycholic acid is needed. Quality of the evidence The trials seemed to be well organised and well run, but there was not always enough information to judge them properly. While, on the whole, we do not think that any factors linked to how the trials were run would influence the results greatly, we did have some concerns that in one trial the group taking ursodeoxycholic acid were generally not as healthy at the start of the trial as the group taking placebo. Also, in another trial there were some people who withdrew and were not included in the final analysis, but no reasons for this were given. Overall, we judged the quality of the evidence we found to be low or very low.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adolescent; Adult; Bile [metabolism]; Child; Child, Preschool; Cholagogues and Choleretics [*therapeutic use]; Chronic Disease; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Humans; Liver Diseases [etiology, *prevention & control]; Liver [enzymology]; Nutritional Status; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Ursodeoxycholic Acid [*therapeutic use]","10.1002/14651858.CD000222.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD000222.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Infusion of bypassing agents, such as recombinant activated FVII (rFVIIa) and plasma‐derived activated prothrombin complex concentrate, are suggested as alternative therapies to factor VIII (haemophilia A) or IX (haemophilia B) for individuals who no longer respond to these treatments because they develop inhibitory antibodies. The ultimate goal of treatment is to preserve the individual's joints, otherwise destroyed by recurrent bleeds. Objectives To assess the effects of bypassing agent prophylaxis to prevent bleeding in people with hemophilia A or B and inhibitors. Search methods We searched for relevant studies from the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register, comprising of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched trial registries (16 February 2017) and bibliographic references of retrieved studies were reviewed for potential articles to be included in the review. Date of the last search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Coagulopathies Trials Register: 12 December 2016. Selection criteria We included randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled studies (cross‐over or parallel design) evaluating the effect of prophylaxis treatment with bypassing agents compared with on‐demand treatment, or studies evaluating the effects of high‐dose compared with low‐dose prophylaxis in males of any age with hemophilia with inhibitors. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies and extracted data and assessed the risk of bias according to standard Cochrane criteria. They assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE criteria. Main results We included four randomized studies (duration 7 to 15 months) involving 116 males. Risk of bias was judged to be high in two studies due to the open‐label study design and in one study due to attrition bias. Two studies compared on‐demand treatment to prophylaxis with bypassing agents. In one study (34 males) prophylaxis significantly reduced mean overall bleeding rates, MD ‐ 7.27 (95% CI ‐9.92 to ‐4.62) (low quality evidence), mean number of overall bleeding events per month, MD ‐1.10 (95% CI ‐1.54 to ‐0.66), mean number of hemarthrosis, MD ‐6.60 (95% CI ‐9.32 to ‐3.88) (low quality evidence) and mean number of joints that had hemarthrosis, MD ‐0.90 (95% CI ‐1.36 to ‐0.44). The meta‐analysis did not conclusively demonstrate significant benefit of prophylaxis on health‐related quality of life as measured by Haem‐A‐QoL score, EQ‐5D total score and utility score, EQ‐5D VAS and SF‐36 physical summary and mental summary score (low quality evidence for all health‐related quality of life analyses). The remaining two studies compared dose regimens. The results from one study (22 males) did not conclusively demonstrate benefit or harm of high‐dose versus low‐dose recombinant activated factor VIIa (rFVIIa) as a prophylaxis for overall bleeding rate, MD ‐0.82 (95% CI ‐2.27 to 0.63) (moderate quality evidence), target joint bleeding rate, MD ‐3.20 (95% CI ‐7.23 to 0.83) (moderate quality evidence) and serious adverse events, RR 9.00 (95% CI, 0.54 to 149.50) (moderate quality evidence). The overall quality of evidence was moderate to low due to imprecision from limited information provided by studies with small sample sizes and incomplete outcome data in one study. Authors' conclusions The evidence suggests that prophylaxis with bypassing agents may be effective in reducing bleeding in males with hemophilia with inhibitors. However, there is a lack of evidence for the superiority of one agent over the other or for the optimum dosage regimen. Further studies are needed to evaluate the benefits and harms of prophylaxis treatment on health‐related quality of life, as well as the effects of dose of bypassing agents on the outcomes. Plain language summary The use of bypassing agents for preventing bleeding in people with hemophilia with inhibitors Backgound Infusion of bypassing agents, such as recombinant activated FVII (rFVIIa) and plasma‐derived activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC), are suggested as alternative therapies to factor VIII (haemophilia A) or IX (haemophilia B) for individuals who no longer respond to these treatments because they develop inhibitory antibodies. The ultimate goal of treatment is to preserve the individual's joints, otherwise destroyed by recurrent bleeds. We therefore evaluated the effectiveness and safety of bypassing agents when used to prevent, as compared to treat, bleeds. We also compared different doses of bypassing agents in men with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors as a preventative (prophylactic) therapy. Search date The evidence is current to 12 December 2016. Study characteristics We searched the scientific databases for clinical studies evaluating the effects of bypassing agents in men with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors. We included four studies (duration 7 to 15 months), involving 116 individuals. Two studies compared the prophylactic infusion with bypassing agent to on‐demand treatment (treatment given only after the bleeding occurred) and two studies compared high‐dose to low‐dose preventative therapies. Key Results Limited evidence showed that prophylactic use of bypassing agents reduced bleeding events, joint bleeding events and number of affected joints. There was no evidence for improved quality of life amongst those who received prophylaxis as compared to those who received on‐demand therapy. There was no evidence for a difference in benefits or harms between high‐ and low‐dose rFVIIa for prophylaxis. Quality of evidence The overall quality of evidence of these studies was moderate to low as the included studies were small and provided limited information. Also, in one of the studies, up to 24% of the men recruited were not included in the analysis of the results, which further increases imprecision of results.","9","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Coagulants [*therapeutic use]; Factor VIIa [*therapeutic use]; Hemarthrosis [*prevention & control]; Hemophilia A [complications, *drug therapy]; Hemophilia B [complications, *drug therapy]; Humans; Male; Prothrombin [*therapeutic use]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Recombinant Proteins [therapeutic use]","10.1002/14651858.CD011441.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011441.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

The WHO estimates that, globally, 5% of adults are carriers of a haemoglobin condition, 2.9% are carriers of thalassaemia and 2.3% are carriers of sickle cell disease. Carriers are found worldwide as a result of migration of various ethnic groups to different regions of the world. Zinc is an easily available supplement and intervention programs have been carried out to prevent deficiency in people with thalassaemia or sickle cell anaemia. It is important to evaluate the role of zinc supplementation in the treatment of thalassaemia and sickle cell anaemia to reduce deaths due to complications. Objectives To assess the effect of zinc supplementation in the treatment of thalassaemia and sickle cell disease. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of most recent search: 01 February 2013. Selection criteria Randomised, placebo‐controlled trials of zinc supplements for treating thalassaemia or sickle cell disease administered at least once a week for at least a month. Data collection and analysis Two review authors assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of the included trials, extracted and analysed data and wrote the review. We summarised results using risk ratios or rate ratios for dichotomous data and mean differences for continuous data. We combined trial results where appropriate. Main results We identified nine trials for inclusion with all nine contributing outcome data. Two trials reported on people with thalassaemia (n = 152) and seven on sickle cell anaemia (n = 307). In people with thalassaemia, in one trial, the serum zinc level value showed no difference between the zinc supplemented group and the control group, mean difference 47.40 (95% confidence interval ‐12.95 to 107.99). Regarding anthropometry, in one trial, height velocity was significantly increased in patients who received zinc supplementation for one to seven years duration, mean difference 3.37 (95% confidence interval 2.36 to 4.38) (total number of participants = 26). In one trial, however, there was no difference in body mass index between treatment groups. Zinc acetate supplementation for three months (in one trial) and one year (in two trials) (total number of participants = 71) was noted to increase the serum zinc level significantly in patients with sickle cell anaemia, mean difference 14.90 (95% confidence interval 6.94 to 22.86) and 20.25 (95% confidence interval 11.73 to 28.77) respectively. There was no significant difference in haemoglobin level between intervention and control groups, at either three months (one trial) or one year (one trial), mean difference 0.06 (95% confidence interval ‐0.84 to 0.96) and mean difference ‐0.07 (95% confidence interval ‐1.40 to 1.26) respectively. Regarding anthropometry, one trial showed no significant changes in body mass index or weight after one year of zinc acetate supplementation. In patients with sickle cell disease, the total number of sickle cell crises at one year were significantly decreased in the zinc sulphate supplemented group as compared to controls, mean difference ‐2.83 (95% confidence interval ‐3.51 to ‐2.15) (total participants 130), but not in zinc acetate group, mean difference 1.54 (95% confidence interval ‐2.01 to 5.09) (total participants 22). In one trial at three months and another at one year, the total number of clinical infections were significantly decreased in the zinc supplemented group as compared to controls, mean difference 0.05 (95% confidence interval 0.01 ‐ 0.43) (total number of participants = 36), and mean difference ‐7.64 (95% confidence interval ‐10.89 to ‐4.39) (total number of participants = 21) respectively. Authors' conclusions According to the results, there is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to indicate any benefit of zinc supplementation with regards to serum zinc level in patients with thalassaemia. However, height velocity was noted to increase among those who received this intervention. There is mixed evidence on the benefit of using zinc supplementation in people with sickle cell disease. For instance, there is evidence that zinc supplementation for one year increased the serum zinc levels in patients with sickle cell disease. However, though serum zinc level was raised in patients receiving zinc supplementation, haemoglobin level and anthropometry measurements were not significantly different between groups. Evidence of benefit is seen with the reduction in the number of sickle cell crises among sickle cell patients who received one year of zinc sulphate supplementation and with the reduction in the total number of clinical infections among sickle cell patients who received zinc supplementation for both three months and for one year. The conclusion is based on the data from a small group of trials,which were generally of good quality, with a low risk of bias. The authors recommend that more trials on zinc supplementation in thalassaemia and sickle cell disease be conducted given that the literature has shown the benefits of zinc in these types of diseases. Plain language summary Zinc supplements for thalassaemia and sickle cell disease Zinc is an essential micronutrient, which is needed so that the immune system works at its best and helps the body fight off infection. People may not get enough zinc from food alone. Researchers have therefore looked at zinc supplements as a way of reducing anaemia and preventing infections and complications. The review authors searched the medical literature for randomised controlled studies in which people with sickle cell disease or thalassaemia received either zinc supplements or no supplements. We included nine trials in the review (459 participants). In people with thalassaemia, there is no evidence to indicate any benefit of zinc supplements on serum zinc level. However, there was an improvement in height in those who received the supplements. There is mixed evidence on the benefit of using zinc supplements in people with sickle cell disease. For instance, there is evidence that when supplements are given for one year the serum zinc levels increased; however, haemoglobin levels and body mass index did not differ significantly between groups. We also found that people with sickle cell disease who received zinc supplements (at both three months and at one year) had fewer sickle cell crises and infections. However, given that the total number of trials is small, these results should be treated with caution.","6","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Anemia, Sickle Cell [blood, *therapy]; Body Height; Body Mass Index; Hemoglobin A [metabolism]; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Thalassemia [blood, *therapy]; Zinc Acetate [*administration & dosage]; Zinc Sulfate [*administration & dosage]; Zinc [blood]","10.1002/14651858.CD009415.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009415.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD007298.PUB4","Ferguson, JH; Chang, AB","Vitamin D supplementation for cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2014","Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder with multiorgan effects. In a subgroup with pancreatic insufficiency malabsorption of the fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) may occur. Vitamin D is involved in calcium homeostasis and bone mineralisation and may have extraskeletal effects. This review examines the evidence for vitamin D supplementation in cystic fibrosis. Objectives To assess the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the frequency of vitamin D deficiency, respiratory outcomes and vitamin D toxicity in the cystic fibrosis population. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 08 July 2013. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled studies of vitamin D supplementation compared to placebo in the cystic fibrosis population regardless of exocrine pancreatic function. Data collection and analysis Both authors independently assessed the risk of bias of each included study and extracted outcome data (from published study information) for assessment of bone mineralization, growth and nutritional status, frequency of vitamin D deficiency, respiratory status, quality of life and adverse events. Main results Six studies (239 participants) are included, although only three studies provided data from 69 adults and children with cystic fibrosis for analysis. One study compared a single high dose of vitamin D (250,000 IU) to placebo at the time of hospital admission with a respiratory exacerbation in 30 pancreatic insufficient adults with cystic fibrosis. The second study compared supplemental 800 international units (IU) vitamin D and placebo for 12 months in 30 osteopenic pancreatic insufficient adults; both groups continued 900 IU vitamin D daily. The third study compared supplemental 1 g calcium alone, 1600 IU vitamin D alone, 1600 IU vitamin D and 1 g calcium and placebo in a double‐blind randomised cross‐over study; only nine children who completed both vitamin D and placebo groups after six‐months supplementation and a three‐month washout period are included; pancreatic sufficiency or disease status of participants are not defined. The studies are not directly comparable due to differences in supplementation, outcome reporting and possibly participant characteristics (e.g. severity of lung disease, growth and nutrition, pancreatic sufficiency). The only outcome for which we could combine data from more than two studies was 25‐hydroxyvitamin D levels; patients receiving vitamin D supplementation had significantly higher levels, mean difference 7.24 ng/ml (95% confidence interval 5.01 to 9.46). However, ironically one study reported 1,25(OH) 2 D with levels significantly favouring the placebo group, mean difference ‐30.30 pmol/ml (95% confidence interval ‐59.89 to ‐0.71). Bone mineral density was measured in two studies; both described no significant change between groups. There were no adverse events in any study. The remaining three studies are published as abstracts only and did not provide data for analysis. These abstracts include: a report of pre‐intervention data in a study comparing daily calcitriol (0.25 or 0.5 micrograms) with placebo in pancreatic insufficient children and young adults; an interim report of a double‐blind randomised control study comparing 5000 IU vitamin D daily for 12 weeks during winter in 67 adult cystic fibrosis patients; and a comparison of the effect of three months of vitamin D supplementation (dose not specified) with placebo on bone mineral density in 42 children with cystic fibrosis and low bone mineral density. Risk of bias was highly variable between all studies. Only one study had a low risk of bias for the five main criteria (random sequence generation, allocation, blinding, attrition and reporting). The rest of the studies had unclear or high risks of bias. Two studies had a low risk of bias for blinding and another two studies for attrition bias. In the studies published as abstracts, assessment of the risks of bias was uncertain in many aspects. Authors' conclusions In patients receiving vitamin D supplementation, 25‐hydroxyvitamin D levels are significantly higher. However, there is no evidence of clinical benefit or harm in the limited number of small‐sized published studies. Adherence to relevant cystic fibrosis guidelines on vitamin D supplementation should be considered until further evidence is available. Plain language summary The use of regular vitamin D preparations for children and adults with cystic fibrosis Cystic fibrosis with pancreatic insufficiency can mean that fat‐soluble vitamins, such as vitamin D, are poorly absorbed. This can lead to vitamin deficiencies. Lack of vitamin D (vitamin D deficiency) can cause specific problems such as bone deformity and bone fractures. It may also be associated with poorer general and respiratory health. Therefore, people with cystic fibrosis are usually given regular vitamin D preparations from a very young age. However, excess vitamin D can also cause respiratory problems and problems with high calcium levels. The review contains six studies, however we could only analyse data from three of these studies. Three studies were only published as conference abstracts. The included studies varied greatly in quality, the amount of vitamin D administered, the duration of treatment and the outcomes that were measured. Three studies were in children and adolescents and three in adults. Few outcome data could be combined. The sole outcome that included data from two or more studies was vitamin D levels. Our analysis showed increased vitamin D levels in people who were given vitamin D supplements. For other outcomes, we found no evidence to show whether giving vitamin D regularly to people with cystic fibrosis is beneficial or not. We are unable to draw any conclusions about giving routine vitamin D supplements and recommend that, until more evidence is available, local guidelines are followed regarding this practice.","5","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Dietary Supplements; Adult; Bone Density Conservation Agents [*administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Bone Diseases, Metabolic [*drug therapy, etiology]; Calcifediol [blood]; Calcitriol [administration & dosage, adverse effects]; Calcium, Dietary [administration & dosage]; Child; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications, metabolism]; Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency [complications]; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Vitamin D Deficiency [complications, drug therapy]; Vitamin D [*administration & dosage, adverse effects]","10.1002/14651858.CD007298.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007298.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Infants (children aged up to 23 months) are at particularly high risk, but conventional polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccines may be ineffective in this age group. New conjugate pneumococcal vaccines are now available, which may help to reduce the incidence of infection in people with sickle cell disease. Objectives To determine the efficacy of pneumococcal vaccines for reducing morbidity and mortality in people with sickle cell disease. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, comprising of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. In addition, we contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field. Date of most recent search of Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 09 December 2011. Selection criteria All randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing a polysaccharide or conjugate pneumococcal vaccine regimen with a different regimen or no vaccination in people with sickle cell disease. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed trial quality. Main results Nine trials were identified in the searches and five trials, with a total of 547 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Only one trial reported incidence of pneumococcal infection, and this demonstrated that the polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine used (PPV14) failed to reduce significantly the risk of infection in children under three years of age, but was associated with only minor adverse events. Three trials of conjugate pneumococcal vaccines found that antibody responses were increased compared to control groups, including those in infants, although clinical outcomes were not measured in these trials. Authors' conclusions Previous trials have shown that conjugate pneumococcal vaccines are safe and effective in normal healthy individuals, including those under the age of two years. The controlled trials included in this review have demonstrated immunogenicity (the ability to induce the body's immune response, without which there is no protection) of these vaccines, and observational studies in people with sickle cell disease support these findings. We therefore recommend that conjugate pneumococcal vaccines are used in people with sickle cell disease. Randomised trials in people with sickle cell disease will be needed to determine the optimal vaccination regimen when further, potentially more effective vaccines become available. Such trials should measure clinical outcomes of effectiveness. The trials included in this review were published between 1983 and 2003. We have not identified any further relevant trials up to December 2011. We therefore do not plan to update this review until new trials are published. Plain language summary Pneumococcal vaccines for sickle cell disease People with sickle cell disease are particularly prone to pneumococcal infection, which may be fatal. Children aged up to 23 months are at high risk, but usual polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccines may not work in this age group. New conjugate pneumococcal vaccines may help to reduce the rate of infection in people with sickle cell disease of all ages. We searched for trials which compared a polysaccharide or conjugate pneumococcal vaccine schedule with a different schedule or no vaccination in people with sickle cell disease. The review includes five trials with a total of 547 participants. One trial showed that the polysaccharide vaccine did not reduce the risk of infection very much in children younger than three years old, but it was linked with only minor adverse events. Three trials of conjugate vaccines showed increased antibody responses compared to control groups in people of all ages, although clinical outcomes were not measured in these trials. This review did not show if the vaccines prevent infection or decrease death rates. We recommend that conjugate pneumococcal vaccines are used in people with sickle cell disease. Randomised trials will be needed to determine the best vaccination schedule when further, potentially more effective vaccines become available. Such trials should measure clinical outcomes of effectiveness.","1","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Anemia, Sickle Cell [*complications]; Child; Humans; Pneumococcal Infections [*prevention & control]; Pneumococcal Vaccines [*therapeutic use]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Vaccines, Conjugate [therapeutic use]","10.1002/14651858.CD003885.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003885.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Drugs insensitive to such antibodies, either recombinant or plasma‐derived, are called factor VIII 'by‐passing' agents and used for treatment of bleeding in people with inhibitors. Objectives To determine the clinical effectiveness of recombinant factor VIIa concentrate compared to plasma‐derived concentrates for treating acute bleeding episodes in people with haemophilia and inhibitors. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Coagulopathies Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register: 23 September 2015. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled clinical trials comparing recombinant factor VIIa concentrate to human plasma‐derived concentrates (high‐dose human or recombinant factor VIII or factor IX concentrate; non‐activated prothrombin complex concentrates; activated prothrombin complex concentrates) in people with haemophilia. Comparisons with animal‐derived products were excluded. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed the trials (eligibility and risk of bias) and extracted data. No combined meta‐analyses were performed due to the unavailability of outcomes and comparisons common to the included trials. Main results A total of 15 trials were identified, two of which (with data for a total of 69 participants) were eligible for analysis. Both trials showed methodological flaws and did not show superiority of one treatment over the other. Both the treatments showed that recombinant factor VIIa and activated prothrombin complex concentrate appeared to have a similar haemostatic effect in both trials, without increasing thromboembolic risk. Authors' conclusions Based on the separate analysis of the two available randomised trials, recombinant factor VIIa and activated prothrombin complex concentrate were found to be similar in efficacy and safety. However, there is a need for further, well‐designed, adequately‐powered, randomised controlled trials to assess the relative benefits and risks of using recombinant factor VIIa compared to human plasma‐derived concentrates in people with haemophilia with inhibitors. It is advisable that researchers in the field define commonly agreed objective outcome measures in order to enable the pooling of their results, thus increasing the power of comparisons. To date, data could not be combined in a formal meta‐analysis. For the same reason reporting concordant and discordant pairs in cross‐over trials is recommended. Plain language summary Recombinant (non‐human) factor VIIa clotting factor concentrates versus plasma concentrates for acute bleeds in people with haemophilia and inhibitors Review question We wanted to find evidence on the effectiveness of recombinant factor VIIa (containing no human proteins) as compared to concentrates derived from plasma for treating acute bleeding episodes in people with haemophilia with inhibitors. Background Haemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder caused by a lack of a clotting factor and is characterised by bleeding into the joints. It is treated by injecting a drug containing the missing clotting factor into veins. In some individuals with haemophilia, this factor is seen by the body as a foreign protein when it is injected and the body produces an antibody (inhibitor) that destroys the factor. In this way these people become resistant to treatment. Once someone with haemophilia develops an inhibitor, they are treated to remove the antibody (immunotolerance induction) and for acute bleeding episodes. Treatment for bleeding episodes is with one of two available bypassing agents, recombinant activated factor VIIa (Novoseven ® ) or human activated prothrombin complex concentrate (FEIBA ® ). It is not known if one of these products is better than the other. We searched for trials comparing the effectiveness (time until bleeding stops, effect on joint motion, need for re‐treatment) and safety of Novoseven ®  and FEIBA ®  in people with haemophilia with inhibitors during episodes of acute bleeding. Search date The evidence is current to: 23 September 2015. Study characteristics The review included two trials with 69 people (aged one to 55 years) with severe haemophilia with inhibitors .  Both trials compared recombinant factor VIIa with activated prothrombin complex concentrate and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly. Key results   We found two clinical trials comparing Novoseven ®  and FEIBA ® . The trials did not show a difference in how well the two products worked and both were tolerated equally well with no clotting complications. We conclude that both recombinant factor VIIa and plasma‐derived concentrates can be used to treat bleeds in people with haemophilia and inhibitors. Quality of the evidence There were some major problems with regards to the way both trials were designed, in relation to knowing which treatment group each person was in (both before the trial was started and during) and also how missing results were handled.","12","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Acute Disease; Blood Coagulation Factors [*therapeutic use]; Factor VIII [immunology, therapeutic use]; Factor VIIa [*therapeutic use]; Hemophilia A [blood, *drug therapy]; Hemophilia B [blood, *drug therapy]; Hemorrhage [*drug therapy]; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Recombinant Proteins [therapeutic use]","10.1002/14651858.CD004449.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004449.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD011579.PUB2","Foong, WC; Ho, JJ; Loh, CK; Viprakasit, V","Hydroxyurea for reducing blood transfusion in non‐transfusion dependent beta thalassaemias","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2016","Abstract - Background Non‐transfusion dependent beta thalassaemia is a subset of inherited haemoglobin disorders characterised by reduced production of the beta globin chain of the haemoglobin molecule leading to anaemia of varying severity. Although blood transfusion is not a necessity for survival, it is required when episodes of chronic anaemia occur. This chronic anaemia can impair growth and affect quality of life. People with non‐transfusion dependent beta thalassaemia suffer from iron overload due to their body's increased capability of absorbing iron from food sources. Iron overload becomes more pronounced in those requiring blood transfusion. People with a higher foetal haemoglobin level have been found to require fewer blood transfusions. Hydroxyurea has been used to increase foetal haemoglobin level; however, its efficacy in reducing transfusion, chronic anaemia complications and its safety need to be established. Objectives To assess the effectiveness, safety and appropriate dose regimen of hydroxyurea in people with non‐transfusion dependent beta thalassaemia (haemoglobin E combined with beta thalassaemia and beta thalassaemia intermedia). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals. We also searched ongoing trials registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 30 April 2016. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials of hydroxyurea in people with non‐transfusion dependent beta thalassaemia comparing hydroxyurea with placebo or standard treatment or comparing different doses of hydroxyurea. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently applied the inclusion criteria in order to select trials for inclusion. Both authors assessed the risk of bias of trials and extracted the data. A third author verified these assessments. Main results No trials comparing hydroxyurea with placebo or standard care were found. However, we included one randomised controlled trial (n = 61) comparing 20 mg/kg/day with 10 mg/kg/day of hydroxyurea for 24 weeks. Both haemoglobin and foetal haemoglobin levels were lower at 24 weeks in the 20 mg group compared with the 10 mg group, mean difference ‐2.39 (95% confidence interval ‐ 2.8 to ‐1.98) and mean difference ‐1.5 (95% confidence interval ‐1.83 to ‐1.17), respectively. Major adverse effects were significantly more common in the 20 mg group, for neutropenia risk ratio 9.93 (95% confidence interval 1.34 to 73.97) and for thrombocytopenia risk ratio 3.68 (95% confidence interval 1.13 to 12.07). No difference was reported for minor adverse effects (gastrointestinal disturbances and raised liver enzymes). The effect of hydroxyurea on transfusion frequency was not reported. The overall quality for the outcomes reported was graded as very low mainly because the outcomes were derived from only one small study with an unclear method of allocation concealment. Authors' conclusions There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to show whether hydroxyurea has any effect compared with controls on the need for blood transfusion. Administration of 10 mg/kg/day compared to 20 mg/kg/day of hydroxyurea resulted in higher haemoglobin levels and seems safer with fewer adverse effects. It has not been reported whether hydroxyurea is capable of reducing the need for blood transfusion. Large well‐designed randomised controlled trials with sufficient duration of follow up are recommended. Plain language summary Hydroxyurea for reducing blood transfusion in non‐transfusion dependent beta thalassaemias Review question We wanted to find out if giving hydroxyurea to people with non‐transfusion dependent beta thalassaemia would reduce the need for blood transfusion. Background Thalassaemia is a genetic blood disorder causing defective adult haemoglobin (the oxygen carrying component of red blood cells). This causes anaemia with different degrees of severity. People with non‐transfusion dependent beta thalassaemia do not depend on regular transfusions for survival, but may require blood transfusion from time to time. Persistent anaemia affects growth, may delay puberty and reduce quality of life. However, transfusion should be avoided, if possible, because it leads to excess iron being deposited in various organs affecting how they function. People with non‐transfusion dependent beta thalassaemia have higher levels of foetal haemoglobin (the main form of haemoglobin found during the development of a baby before birth). After birth, foetal haemoglobin gradually disappears and is replaced by the defective adult haemoglobin. A small amount of foetal haemoglobin remains after birth and is often present in people with non‐transfusion dependent beta thalassaemia. The higher the level of foetal haemoglobin the less transfusion could be needed. Hydroxyurea is an anti‐cancer treatment which increases the level of foetal haemoglobin. Therefore, it might reduce the need for blood transfusion in people with non‐transfusion dependent beta thalassaemia. However, it is not known whether hydroxyurea is effective and safe and if so, which is the best dose and at which age treatment should start. Search date The evidence is current to 30 April 2016. Study characteristics We did not find any randomised controlled trials (where people taking part in the trial have equal chances of being in the treatment or the control group) comparing hydroxyurea with a placebo (a dummy drug) or usual care. However, we found one randomised controlled trial comparing two different doses of hydroxyurea (10 mg/kg/day versus 20 mg/kg/day given for 24 weeks) and included it in this review. A total of 61 people took part in this trial. Key results The lower dose of hydroxyurea appeared to increase levels of foetal haemoglobin, but the higher dose did not. We found some evidence that the higher dose was harmful, particularly to the bone marrow. The trial did not look at whether blood transfusions could be given less often or whether the effects of the anaemia were reduced. In the short term, the lower dose does not appear to have any side effects. The trial duration was very short and we need to know what might happen if treatment with hydroxyurea is continued for a longer period of time. Quality of the evidence We graded the quality of the evidence as very low. This was because our key results are based on only one small trial. In addition we can not be sure whether the trial methods were of high quality because the authors have not completely described them.","10","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Blood Transfusion [*statistics & numerical data]; Hematinics [*administration & dosage]; Hemoglobin A [analysis]; Humans; Hydroxyurea [*administration & dosage]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; beta-Thalassemia [blood, *drug therapy]","10.1002/14651858.CD011579.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011579.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Extra fluids are routinely given as adjunct treatment, regardless of the individual's state of hydration with the aim of slowing or stopping the sickling process and thereby alleviating pain. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives To determine the optimal route, quantity and type of fluid replacement for people with sickle cell disease with acute painful crises. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also conducted searches of Embase (November 2007), LILACS, www.ClinicalTrials.gov (05 January 2010), and the WHO ICTRP (30 June 2017). Date of most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 16 February 2017. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials that compared the administration of supplemental fluids adjunctive to analgesics by any route in people with any type of sickle cell disease during an acute painful episode, under medical supervision (inpatient, day care or community). Data collection and analysis No relevant trials have yet been identified. Main results Sixteen trials were identified by the searches, all of which were not eligible for inclusion in the review. Authors' conclusions Treating vaso‐occlusive crises is complex and requires multiple interventions. Extra fluids, generally oral or intravenous, are routinely administered during acute painful episodes to people with sickle cell disease regardless of the individual's state of hydration. Reports of their use during these acute painful episodes do not state the efficacy of any single route, type or quantity of fluid compared to another. However, there are no randomised controlled trials that have assessed the safety and efficacy of different routes, types or quantities of fluid. This systematic review identifies the need for a multicentre randomised controlled trial assessing the efficacy and possible adverse effects of different routes, types and quantities of fluid administered to people with sickle cell disease during acute painful episodes. Plain language summary Replacing fluids to treat acute episodes of pain in people with sickle cell disease Review question To assess the best route, quantity and type of fluid replacement for people with sickle cell disease with acute painful crises. Background Sickle cell disease is a common genetic disorder characterised by periodic episodes of pain which usually happen again and again throughout life. These episodes occur when sickled cells obstruct blood vessels. The degree of pain may range from a mild discomfort to a severe disabling pain where the person needs treatment in hospital. A drop in body fluid levels promotes and sustains the sickling process. Routine treatment includes the use of drugs to relieve pain and the maintenance of adequate fluid levels. Fluid levels will fall if insufficient fluids are taken in compared to the amount of fluid lost. The kidneys of people with sickle cell disease do not concentrate urine properly, which results in poor control of bodily fluids. Additional fluids are given to try and slow or stop the sickling process which should reduce the amount and duration of pain. Fluids may be given in many ways, but orally or intravenously are most common. Fluids should be given with care so as to prevent fluid overload which may in turn cause adverse events such as heart failure or fluid building up in the lungs. We looked for randomised controlled trials to show the best way to replace fluids, which type of fluids and how much fluid to replace to treat acute episodes of pain in people with sickle cell disease. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Search date The evidence is current to: 16 February 2017. Trial characteristics We did not find any randomized controlled trials (trials where the people taking part are put into different treatment groups completely at random) which we could include in the review.

Life for individuals with sickle cell disease can be affected by repeated acute complications and compounded by progressive organ damage. Studies reveal that when people with chronic illness learn self‐management, their clinical outcomes and quality of life improves; and they show lower dependence on healthcare services. There are, however, no reviews identifying which interventions improve knowledge and little is known about the impact of patient or care‐giver knowledge on clinical and psychosocial outcomes in people with sickle cell disease. Objectives 1. To determine the effectiveness of patient‐ and caregiver‐centred educational interventions for changing knowledge and understanding of sickle cell disease among patients as well as caregivers of people with the disease. 2. To assess the effectiveness and safety of patient‐ and caregiver‐centred educational interventions and programs for the recognition of signs and symptoms of disease‐related morbidity, adherence to treatment and healthcare utilization in patients with sickle cell disease. Search methods The authors searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Additional trials were sought from the reference lists of the trials and reviews identified by the search strategy. Date of last search: 11 April 2016. Selection criteria Randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials which evaluate the effectiveness of individual‐ and group‐based interventions for either the patient with sickle cell disease or their caregivers, or both. Eligible interventions will aim to change knowledge, attitudes or skills, improve psychosocial aspects of the disease as well as treatment adherence and healthcare utilization. Trials evaluating the intervention versus no program, comparing two interventions and those which are part of a multi‐faceted intervention to improve a range of sickle cell‐related health outcomes are all eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials based on stated inclusion criteria and thereafter examined each selected report to extract data using a prepared, piloted, data collection form. A third author assisted in reaching consensus if there were any discrepancies. Similarly, risk of bias was assessed by two authors and verified by a third author. Main results A total of 12 trials (11 randomized controlled trials and one quasi‐randomized trial) of 563 people with HbSS, HbSC or HbSβthal, aged six to 35 years old, were included in the review; the majority of participants were African‐American. Interventions ranged from a total of one hour to weekly sessions for eight weeks and the post‐intervention assessments ranged from the end of the intervention period to 12 months after completion. The heterogeneity of the included trials, which encompasses setting, inclusion and exclusion criteria, interventional method and time of assessment, ranged from 'not important' to 'moderate to substantial' for different review outcomes. The overall risk of bias was low for selective reporting, unclear for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and blinding of outcome assessment. Incomplete outcome reporting and blinding of personnel showed mixed bias representations. Patient knowledge was assessed by four trials (160 participants) with moderate to substantial heterogeneity. There was evidence that educational programs improved patient knowledge, standardised mean difference 0.87 points (95% confidence interval 0.28 to 1.45, moderate quality evidence), which improved further when a trial with high bias was removed in a sensitivity analysis. Caregiver knowledge, reported in a single trial of 20 families, also showed an improvement, standardised mean difference 0.52 points (95% confidence interval 0.03 to 1.00, moderate quality evidence). The effect on patient knowledge was sustained at longer follow‐up periods, whereas the effect on caregiver knowledge was not sustained. There were two primary outcomes related to the effectiveness of educational programs on the recognition of signs and symptoms of disease‐related morbidity. No comparative data were reported for patients or caregivers (or both) recognising signs and symptoms leading to self‐management. Data from two trials were analysed for the utilization of health services and showed no evidence of an effect, mean difference 0.33 (95% confidence interval ‐0.57 to 1.23, moderate quality evidence). With regard to the review's secondary outcomes, depression showed a statistically significant decline in intervention groups, standardised mean difference ‐0.66 points (95% confidence interval ‐1.18, to ‐0.14, moderate quality evidence). Adherence to treatment was not assessed in any of the identified trials. No effects of interventions were seen on coping, family relationships or health‐related quality of life of patients. The quality of evidence was low for positive coping and moderate for child knowledge, healthcare utilization and depression. This suggests that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimates. Authors' conclusions This review identifies important positive effects of educational interventions on improving patient knowledge of sickle cell disease and depression. Effects on patients' knowledge were maintained for longer than for caregivers. The effect on knowledge was significant but small and whether it offers any clinical benefit is uncertain. Significant factors limiting these effects could be trials being under powered as well as attrition rates. Effects were not statistically significant in assessments of secondary outcomes, possibly due to the paucity of the number of trials and patients and caregivers. Trials showed moderate to high heterogeneity which might impact the results. To better study effects on outcomes, further controlled trials are needed with rigorous attention given to improve recruitment and retention and to decrease bias. Predetermined protocols using similar measurements should be used across multiple sites. Plain language summary Interventions for patients and caregivers to improve knowledge of sickle cell disease and recognition of its related complications Review question We wished to determine if any educational interventions have helped people with sickle cell disease and their caregivers to improve their understanding of the disease, recognize its complications, improve their adherence to treatment, affect how they utilize healthcare and improve other social and psychological problems that they might face. Background Sickle cell disease is a lifelong, inherited disorder which can cause a number of complications throughout an individual's life. It may cause a huge burden on both the patient and their family, including frequent visits to healthcare facilities. The illness causes not just physical complications such as painful crises and strokes, but may have many other effects such as depression, poor quality of life, coping issues and poor family relationships. When people with a chronic illness have better understanding about their illness, they manage their illness better and improve their quality of life. We wish to compare effects of different interventions as well as individual interventions to no intervention. Search date The evidence is current to 11 April 2016. Study characteristics The review included 12 trials (563 people with HbSS, HbSC or HbSβthal aged six to 35 years). Participants were assigned randomly to either educational programs, no program and in some cases to a non‐educational program, e.g. art therapy. Interventions ranged from a total of one hour to weekly sessions for eight weeks and post‐intervention assessments ranged from the end of the intervention period to 12 months after completion. Key results Educational programs and other interventions have resulted in improvements in patient knowledge or understanding of sickle cell disease, and a decrease in depression. Effects on patients' knowledge were maintained for longer than for caregivers. The effects are shown to be small but may result from the fact that most studies had very small numbers of participants and there was much variation between studies. The interventions studied showed no effect on patients' utilization of health services, relationships between families, caregiver or patient skills, coping or health‐related quality of life of the patient. No comparative data were reported for patients or caregivers (or both) recognising signs and symptoms leading to self‐management. No trials assessed the adherence to treatment. Quality of the evidence Trials varied in the interventions being studied as well as how the different outcomes were measured. The quality of evidence was low for the outcome positive coping and moderate for the outcomes child knowledge, healthcare utilization and depression. This suggests that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the effect of the treatment. Further research using randomized controlled trials with more people (including different populations) are needed to improve our understanding of which interventions are likely to be useful.","10","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; *Patient Education as Topic; Adolescent; Adult; Anemia, Sickle Cell [*complications]; Caregivers [*education]; Child; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD011175.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011175.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD011180.PUB2","Strike, K; Mulder, K; Michael, R","Exercise for haemophilia","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2016","Abstract - Background Haemophilia is a bleeding disorder associated with haemorrhaging into joints and muscles. Exercise is often used to aid recovery after bleeds, and to improve joint function in the presence of arthropathy. Objectives Our objective was to systematically review the available evidence on the safety and effectiveness of exercise for people with haemophilia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register and electronic databases PubMed, OVID‐Embase, and CINAHL. We hand searched abstracts from congresses of the World Federation of Hemophilia and the European Hematology Association, trial registries and the reference lists of relevant articles. Date of the last search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register: 14 December 2016. Selection criteria Randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled studies comparing any exercise intervention considered relevant in haemophilia management including supervised, unsupervised, aquatic, strengthening, aerobic or cardiovascular, stretching, proprioceptive and balance training exercise programs in males of any age with haemophilia A or B of any severity (those with co‐morbidities were not excluded). Data collection and analysis Two authors reviewed the identified abstracts to determine their eligibility. For studies meeting the inclusion criteria, full articles were obtained. The two authors extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion. The authors contacted study investigators to obtain any missing data. Main results Eight studies were included, which represented 233 males with all severities of haemophilia A and B, ranging in age from eight years to 49 years. Study duration ranged from four to 12 weeks. Exercise interventions varied greatly and included resistance exercises, isometric exercises, bicycle ergometry, treadmill walking and hydrotherapy; therefore, comparison between studies was difficult. None of the studies measured or reported adverse effects from the interventions. None of the studies reported outcomes regarding bleed frequency, quality of life or aerobic activity. Overall risk of bias across all studies was assessed as unclear. Very few studies provided sufficient information for comparison. None of the studies reported data that favoured the control group. One study reported that six weeks of resistance training improved joint health status (Colorado score) compared to controls. The addition of pulsed electromagnetic fields also improved ankle scores compared to exercises alone, but this was not seen in the elbows or knees. Two studies reported statistically significant improvements in pain intensity after exercise interventions compared to controls. Hydrotherapy exercises produced significant decreases in pain compared to controls and land‐based exercise groups. Two studies found improvement in joint motion in the exercise group compared to controls. One study compared land‐ and water‐based exercises; there was no difference in the range of motion between the two groups; however, the water‐based exercise group did show improvement over the control group. One study, comparing joint traction and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation for the elbow to a control group, showed no differences in biceps girth or strength after 12 weeks of intervention. Some studies reported comparisons between interventions. In one study, treadmill training significantly improved balance in children compared to bicycle ergometry. Another study added partial weight bearing exercises to quadriceps exercises and showed improved walking tolerance. Four studies evaluated quadriceps or hamstring strength (or both). The addition of bicycle ergometry and exercises with weights was more effective than static exercises and treadmill walking for strengthening knee flexors and extensors. Partial weight‐bearing exercises through range were more effective than static and short arc exercises for improving knee extensor strength. The addition of treadmill walking to ultrasound, stretching and strengthening exercises showed increased peak torque of knee flexors and extensors and decrease in knee effusion. The results should be interpreted with caution due to the quality of evidence (GRADE) as outlined in the summary of findings tables, which demonstrates that all but one of the outcomes assessed were rated as low or very low due to the small sample sizes and potential bias. Authors' conclusions These results must be considered with caution. There is a lack of confidence in the results due to the small number of included studies and the inability to pool the results due to the heterogeneity of outcome measures. Most exercise interventions produced improvement in one or more of the measured outcomes including pain, range of motion, strength and walking tolerance. Hydrotherapy may be more effective than land exercises for pain relief in adults. Functional exercises such as treadmill walking and partial weight bearing exercises seem to be more effective than static or short arc exercises for improving muscle strength. These findings are consistent with the many non‐controlled intervention reports in the haemophilia literature. No adverse effects were reported as a result of any of the interventions. However, some groups used prophylactic factor prior to exercise and other groups studied only subjects with moderate haemophilia. Therefore, the safety of these techniques for persons with severe haemophilia remains unclear. Plain language summary Exercise for people with haemophilia Review question We reviewed the evidence about the safety and usefulness of exercise for men with haemophilia. Background Haemophilia is a group of disorders in which one of the blood clotting proteins does not work properly. It mainly affects men, although women can also be affected. People with haemophilia bleed into their joints and muscles which can lead to painful chronic arthritis. Exercise is often used during recovery from a joint or muscle bleed and to maintain or improve a person's ability to function and participate in daily activities despite joint damage. We wanted to know if exercise was safe (that is, exercise does not cause additional bleeding) and whether exercise was able to improve muscle strength, joint mobility, pain, balance, gait, fitness, and overall functioning. Search date The evidence is current to: 14 December 2016. Study characteristics We included eight studies with 233 male participants with haemophilia A or B (of any severity), aged eight to 49 years. Length of study ranged from four to 12 weeks. Key results Several types of exercise programs were studied, including stretching, strengthening with weights, exercise in water, treadmill walking, and exercise bicycle. Some studies compared participants who did one type of exercise with those who did another type of exercise; other studies compared an exercise group with a control group that did no exercise. There were no data relating to our primary outcomes which indicated whether bleed frequency changed after an exercise program. There were no adverse effects measured or reported. Quality of life was not measured. Regarding our secondary outcomes, improvements were seen in balance, joint health, and pain. Walking distance was the only functional status measured. In an unplanned additional analysis, improvements were seen in the range of motion, biceps perimeter; strength, and knee circumference. These small studies showed more improvements in pain, muscle strength and joint range of motion in exercise groups than in control groups. Studies that included functional activity, such as walking on a treadmill, showed more improvement than exercise alone. Exercise in water seems to be more effective than land exercise in relieving joint pain in adults. Quality of the evidence Four studies included only males with moderate haemophilia. Three studies included all severities of haemophilia and in one, participants used clotting factor prior to participating. Two studies included males with both haemophilia A and B; three studies did not specify type. Only one study limited their participants to those with severe haemophilia, and these also had osteoporosis. It is not clear whether the same results would be achieved if only males with severe haemophilia A were studied. The results should be interpreted with caution due to the quality of the evidence; we judged that all but one of the outcomes assessed were low or very low quality, due to small sample sizes and potential bias.","12","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Exercise Therapy [*methods]; Hemarthrosis [rehabilitation]; Hemophilia A [*rehabilitation]; Hemophilia B [*rehabilitation]; Humans; Hydrotherapy; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle Strength; Muscle Stretching Exercises; Pain Measurement; Pain [rehabilitation]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Range of Motion, Articular; Resistance Training","10.1002/14651858.CD011180.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011180.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Respiratory failure, due to recurrent pulmonary infection and inflammation, is the most common cause of mortality. Muco‐active therapies (e.g. dornase alfa and nebulized hypertonic saline) may decrease sputum viscosity, increase airway clearance of sputum, reduce infection and inflammation and improve lung function. Thiol derivatives, either oral or nebulized, have shown benefit in other respiratory diseases. Their mode of action is likely to differ according to the route of administration. There are several thiol derivatives, and it is unclear which of these may be beneficial in cystic fibrosis. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of nebulized and oral thiol derivatives in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, hand searches of relevant journals, abstract books and conference proceedings. Most recent search: 13 June 2013. We also conducted a PubMed search on 26 February 2013 for relevant published articles. Selection criteria Randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials comparing nebulized or oral thiol derivatives to placebo or another thiol derivative in people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis The authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, analysed risk of bias and extracted data. Main results Searches identified 23 trials; nine trials (255 participants) are included, of these seven trials are more than 10 years old. Three trials of nebulized thiol derivatives were identified (one compared 20% N‐acetylcysteine to 2% N‐acetylcysteine; another compared sodium‐2‐mercaptoethane sulphonate to 7% hypertonic saline; and another compared glutathione to 4% hypertonic saline). Although generally well‐tolerated with no significant adverse effects, there was no evidence of significant clinical benefit in our primary outcomes in participants receiving these treatments. Six trials of oral thiol derivatives were identified. Three trials compared N‐acetylcysteine to placebo; one compared N‐acetylcysteine, ambroxol and placebo; one compared carbocysteine to ambroxol; and one compared low and high‐dose N‐acetylcysteine. Oral thiol derivatives were generally well‐tolerated with no significant adverse effects, however there was no evidence of significant clinical benefit in our primary outcomes in participants receiving these treatments. Authors' conclusions We found no evidence to recommend the use of either nebulized or oral thiol derivatives in people with cystic fibrosis. There are very few good quality trials investigating the effect of these medications in cystic fibrosis, and further research is required to investigate the potential role of these medications in improving the outcomes of people with cystic fibrosis. Plain language summary Compounds which can break down the structure of mucus for lung disease in cystic fibrosis Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder which mainly affects the lungs. Chest infections recur in people with cystic fibrosis due to a build up of thick sputum (phlegm) in the air passages. Several treatments, including thiol derivatives, aim to loosen this sputum and so improve lung function and reduce the frequency of chest infections. Thiol derivatives may be either nebulized (breathed in) or oral (by mouth). They have been shown to help in other lung conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This review aims to find out if there is enough evidence to recommend the use of nebulized or oral thiol derivatives for people with cystic fibrosis. We included nine trials; three assessed the effect of nebulized thiol derivatives. Of the nebulized trials, one compared 20% N‐acetylcysteine to 2% N‐acetylcysteine; another compared sodium‐2‐mercaptoethane sulphonate to 7% hypertonic saline; and the other compared glutathione to 4% hypertonic saline. Nebulized thiol derivatives were generally well‐tolerated with no major adverse effects. However they showed no significant improvements in any of our outcome measures. Six included trials assessed the effects of oral thiol derivatives.Three of these trials compared oral N‐acetylcysteine to placebo; one compared oral N‐acetylcysteine, oral ambroxol and placebo; and one compared oral carbocysteine and oral ambroxol (no placebo). None of the trials showed an overall significant benefit in any of the outcome measures of this review. Oral thiol derivatives were generally well‐tolerated with no major adverse effects. In summary, the trials included in the review did not provide any evidence that nebulized or oral thiol derivatives were either beneficial or harmful to people with cystic fibrosis. Further research investigating the effects of thiol derivatives in people with cystic fibrosis is required before their use can be recommended.","7","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Acetylcysteine [*administration & dosage]; Administration, Inhalation; Administration, Oral; Ambroxol [*administration & dosage]; Carbocysteine [*administration & dosage]; Cystic Fibrosis [complications, *drug therapy]; Expectorants [*administration & dosage]; Glutathione [administration & dosage]; Humans; Lung Diseases [drug therapy]; Mucociliary Clearance [drug effects]; Nebulizers and Vaporizers; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Saline Solution, Hypertonic [administration & dosage]","10.1002/14651858.CD007168.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007168.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Bisphosphonates are used in an attempt to increase bone mineral density and reduce these fractures in people with osteogenesis imperfecta. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of bisphosphonates in increasing bone mineral density, reducing fractures and improving clinical function in people with osteogenesis imperfecta. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of journals and conference proceedings. We additionally searched PubMed and major conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Register: 28 April 2016. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing bisphosphonates to placebo, no treatment, or comparator interventions in all types of osteogenesis imperfecta. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included trials. Main results Fourteen trials (819 participants) were included. Overall, the trials were mainly at a low risk of bias, although selective reporting was an issue in several of the trials. Data for oral bisphosphonates versus placebo could not be aggregated; a statistically significant difference favouring oral bisphosphonates in fracture risk reduction and number of fractures was noted in two trials. No differences were reported in the remaining three trials which commented on fracture incidence. Five trials reported data for spine bone mineral density; all found statistically significant increased lumbar spine density z scores for at least one time point studied. For intravenous bisphosphonates versus placebo, aggregated data from two trials showed no statistically significant difference for the number of participants with at least one fracture, risk ratio 0.56 (95% confidence interval 0.30 to 1.06). In the remaining trial no statistically significant difference was noted in fracture incidence. For spine bone mineral density, no statistically significant difference was noted in the aggregated data from two trials, mean difference 9.96 (95% confidence interval ‐2.51 to 22.43). In the remaining trial a statistically significant difference in mean per cent change in spine bone mineral density z score favoured intravenous bisphosphonates at six and 12 months. Data describing growth, bone pain, and functional outcomes after oral or intravenous bisphosphonate therapy, or both, as compared to placebo were incomplete among all studies, but do not show consistent improvements in these outcomes. Two studies compared different doses of bisphosphonates. No differences were found between doses when bone mineral density, fractures, and height or length z score were assessed. One trial compared oral versus intravenous bisphosphonates and found no differences in primary outcomes. Two studies compared the intravenous bisphosphonates zoledronic acid and pamidronate. There were no significant differences in primary outcome. However, the studies were at odds as to the relative benefit of zoledronic acid over pamidronate for lumbosacral bone mineral density at 12 months. Authors' conclusions Bisphophonates are commonly prescribed to individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta. Current evidence, albeit limited, demonstrates oral or intravenous bisphosphonates increase bone mineral density in children and adults with this condition. These were not shown to be different in their ability to increase bone mineral density. It is unclear whether oral or intravenous bisphosphonate treatment consistently decreases fractures, though multiple studies report this independently and no studies report an increased fracture rate with treatment. The studies included here do not show bisphosphonates conclusively improve clinical status (reduce pain; improve growth and functional mobility) in people with osteogenesis imperfecta. Given their current widespread and expected continued use, the optimal method, duration of therapy and long‐term safety of bisphosphonate therapy require further investigation. In addition, attention should be given to long‐term fracture reduction and improvement in quality of life indicators. Plain language summary Bisphosphonate therapy for osteogenesis imperfecta Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect and safety of bisphosphonates in increasing bone mineral density, reducing fractures and improving clinical function in people with osteogenesis imperfecta. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Background Osteogenesis imperfecta is also known as brittle bone disease. It is a genetic condition which can be passed on from a parent to child or occur in the child without any other family history. An affected person is at risk for frequent breaks of the long bones or collapse of the bones of the spine. There is no cure for osteogenesis imperfecta and treatment is mostly supportive. Search date The evidence is current to: 28 April 2016. Study characteristics This review looked at trials studying one of the groups of medications known as bisphosphonates which are more typically used to treat osteoporosis. They are used in osteogenesis imperfecta to try and reduce the number of bone fractures in affected individuals. We included 14 trials, and most of these did not show a major reduction in fractures in affected individuals when treated with bisphosphonates. Key results Each trial independently showed significant improvements in bone mineral density after treatment with oral or intravenous bisphosphonates. Bone pain, growth and quality of life indicators were not reported in enough detail and the effects of this treatment need further investigation. The long‐term effectiveness and safety of bisphosphates, as well as dose and duration of therapy, require extended evaluation Quality of the evidence The majority of trials analysed were small and not powered to show a statistically significant difference in many outcome measures.","10","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Administration, Oral; Bone Density Conservation Agents [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]; Bone Density [drug effects]; Diphosphonates [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]; Fractures, Bone [*prevention & control]; Humans; Injections, Intravenous; Osteogenesis Imperfecta [*drug therapy]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","10.1002/14651858.CD005088.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD005088.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Over‐absorption of sodium results in the dehydration of the liquid that lines the airway surface and (along with defective chloride secretion) is a primary defect in people with CF. Objectives To determine whether the topical administration of drugs that block sodium transport improves the respiratory condition of people with CF. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We contacted principal investigators known to work in the field, previous authors and pharmaceutical companies who manufacture ion transport agents for unpublished or follow‐up data. Most recent search of the Group's register: 19 December 2013. Selection criteria Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐randomised controlled trials of sodium channel blockers compared to placebo or another sodium channel blocker or the same sodium channel blocker at a different dosing regimen. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data. Meta‐analysis was limited due to differing study designs. Main results Five RCTs, with a total of 226 participants, examining the topical administration of the short‐acting sodium channel blocker, amiloride, compared to placebo were identified as eligible for inclusion in the review. In three studies over six months, there was a significant difference found in the difference in relative change in FVC in favour of placebo (weighted mean difference 1.51% (95% confidence interval ‐2.77 to ‐0.25), although heterogeneity was evident. A two‐week study demonstrated that hypertonic saline with amiloride pre‐treatment did not result in a significant improvement in respiratory function or mucus clearance, in contrast to pre‐treatment with placebo. There were no significant differences identified in other clinically relevant outcomes. Authors' conclusions We found no evidence that the topical administration of a short‐acting sodium channel blocker improves respiratory condition in people with cystic fibrosis and some limited evidence of deterioration in lung function. Plain language summary Drugs to control the movement of salt in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis Usually salt is absorbed from liquid on the surface of the lungs to stop fluid building up there. In cystic fibrosis too much salt is absorbed and there is little liquid left on the airway surfaces. As a result people with cystic fibrosis have problems clearing their lungs of sticky secretions. Thus the lungs are left open to infection. Drugs applied directly to the lungs may prevent too much salt being absorbed. This may lead to better clearance of mucus and less lung infection and damage. The review includes five studies with a total of 226 participants. All studies looked at short‐acting drugs applied directly to the lungs compared to placebo. When the results from three studies over six months were combined, the placebo group showed a slower rate of decline in forced vital capacity than the treatment group. However, each of these differed in their results. A further study showed that people receiving a sodium channel blocker before receiving hypertonic saline did not achieve better lung function or mucus clearance than those receiving placebo before hypertonic saline. We found no evidence that short‐acting sodium channel blockers administered directly to the lungs improve respiratory status in people with cystic fibrosis. There was even some limited evidence of a decline in lung function. Trials of long‐acting sodium channel blockers are ongoing.","4","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Amiloride [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]; Anti‐Bacterial Agents [administration & dosage]; Cystic Fibrosis [*drug therapy, physiopathology]; Forced Expiratory Volume [drug effects, physiology]; Humans; Mucus [metabolism]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiration [*drug effects]; Saline Solution, Hypertonic [administration & dosage]; Sodium Channel Blockers [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]; Vital Capacity [drug effects, physiology]","10.1002/14651858.CD005087.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD005087.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

It can be broadly divided into two distinct clinical phenotypes characterized by either haemolysis or vaso‐occlusion. Pain is the most prominent symptom of vaso‐occlusion, and hypercoagulability is a well‐established pathogenic phenomenon in people with sickle cell disease. Low‐molecular‐weight heparins might control this hypercoagulable state through their anticoagulant effect. This is an update of a previously published version of this review. Objectives To assess the effects of low‐molecular‐weight heparins for managing vaso‐occlusive crises in people with sickle cell disease. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches. We also searched abstract books of conference proceedings and several online trials registries for ongoing trials. Date of the last search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 28 September 2015. Selection criteria Randomised controlled clinical trials and controlled clinical trials that assessed the effects of low‐molecular‐weight heparins in the management of vaso‐occlusive crises in people with sickle cell disease. Data collection and analysis Study selection, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias and analyses were carried out independently by the two review authors. Main results Two studies comprising 287 participants were included. One study (with an overall unclear to high risk of bias) involved 253 participants and the quality of the evidence for most outcomes was very low. This study, reported that pain severity at day two and day three was lower in the tinzaparin group than in the placebo group (P < 0.01, analysis of variance (ANOVA)) and additionally at day 4 (P < 0.05 (ANOVA)). Thus tinzaparin resulted in more rapid resolution of pain, as measured with a numerical pain scale. The mean difference in duration of painful crises was statistically significant at ‐1.78 days in favour of the tinzaparin group (95% confidence interval ‐1.94 to ‐1.62). Participants treated with tinzaparin had statistically significantly fewer hospitalisation days than participants in the group treated with placebo, with a mean difference of ‐4.98 days (95% confidence interval ‐5.48 to ‐4.48). Two minor bleeding events were reported as adverse events in the tinzaparin group, and none were reported in the placebo group. The second study (unclear risk of bias) including 34 participants and was a conference abstract with limited data and only addressed one of the predefined outcomes of the review; i.e. pain intensity. After one day pain intensity reduced more, as reported on a visual analogue scale, in the dalteparin group than in the placebo group, mean difference ‐1.30 (95% confidence interval ‐1.60 to ‐1.00), with the quality of evidence rated very low. The most important reasons for downgrading the quality of evidence were serious risk of bias and imprecision (due to low sample size or low occurrence of events). Authors' conclusions Based on the results of two studies, evidence is incomplete to support or refute the effectiveness of low‐molecular‐weight heparins in people with sickle cell disease. Vaso‐occlusive crises are extremely debilitating for sufferers of sickle cell disease; therefore well‐designed placebo‐controlled studies with other types of low‐molecular‐weight heparins, and in participants with different genotypes of sickle cell disease, still need to be carried out to confirm or dismiss the results of this single study. Plain language summary Low‐molecular‐weight heparins for pain caused by obstruction of blood vessels in people with sickle cell disease Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effects of low‐molecular‐weight heparins in managing vaso‐occlusive crises in people with sickle cell disease .  This is an update of a previously published version of this review. Background Sickle cell disease is one of the most common and severe genetic blood disorders in the world. As the result of a change in the haemoglobin gene, red blood cells are transformed into cells with a sickle shape. This sickling of red blood cells results in various complications, amongst which are vaso‐occlusive crises. In a vaso‐occlusive crisis, the sickled red blood cells tend to clot together and block blood flow,which leads to pain in the organ involved. The pain can be very debilitating and often requires administration of morphine. Medication that prevents blood from clotting in the vessels might represent a useful contribution to existing treatment options for vaso‐occlusive crises. Search date The evidence is current to: 28 September 2015. Study characteristics The review included two studies that lasted seven days with a total of 287 people. One study involved 253 people (aged approximately 22 years) with sickle cell disease and compared tinzaparin with placebo and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly. The other study was smaller with 34 participants (aged approximately 27 years) and compared dalteparin versus placebo. Key results Tinzaparin reduced the number of days spent in hospital and reduced the pain (and the intensity of the pain) more rapidly. Two minor bleedings were reported in the tinzaparin group versus none in the placebo group. The data regarding the effectiveness of dalteparin were very limited and only addressed pain intensity, being more reduced by treatment with dalteparin than by placebo. These data are not sufficient to support the conclusion that low‐molecular‐weight heparins are effective in the treatment of vaso‐occlusive crises in people with sickle cell disease. Additional studies with different types of low‐molecular‐weight heparin used in different forms of sickle cell disease, are necessary to confirm or dismiss the results of this single study. Vaso‐occlusive crises can be extremely debilitating and can have a significant impact on quality of life; therefore it is important to know whether low‐molecular‐weight heparins might serve as a useful treatment option with few side effects. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence for the majority of outcomes was very low, this had mainly to do with risk of bias of the studies (e.g. method of blinding unclear) or with small sample size of the studies.","12","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Anemia, Sickle Cell [*complications]; Anticoagulants [*therapeutic use]; Dalteparin [*therapeutic use]; Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight [*therapeutic use]; Humans; Pain Measurement; Peripheral Vascular Diseases [*drug therapy, etiology]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Tinzaparin","10.1002/14651858.CD010155.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010155.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD007481.PUB3","Amin, R; Noone, PG; Ratjen, F","Chemical pleurodesis versus surgical intervention for persistent and recurrent pneumothoraces in cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2012","Abstract - Background Pneumothorax is a potentially life‐threatening complication for people with cystic fibrosis. Spontaneous pneumothorax is the presence of air in the pleural space and can be subdivided into first episode and recurrent. The recurrence of pneumothorax is when it occurs on the same side seven days or more after initial resolution. A pneumothorax is persistent if the air leak lasts for more than five days ( Schidlow 1993 ). Managing spontaneous pneumothoraces is controversial and there is no standard treatment. Medical and surgical intervention are the two main categories for the treatment of recurrent pneumothoraces in people with cystic fibrosis. While surgical interventions are felt to be more effective in people without cystic fibrosis, the complications directly related to the procedure, as well as the post‐operative complications make surgical interventions riskier for people with cystic fibrosis. Additionally, these interventions have the potential to make people with cystic fibrosis ineligible for lung transplantation in the future. Therefore, the benefits and side effects or disadvantages for the medical and surgical treatment of recurrent pneumothoraces in people with cystic fibrosis need to be systematically reviewed. Objectives To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of different treatment interventions for managing spontaneous persistent and recurrent pneumothoraces in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 29 October 2012. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials which compared the use of chemical pleurodesis to surgical interventions for the treatment of persistent and recurrent pneumothoraces in CF. Data collection and analysis No relevant trials were identified. Main results No trials were included in this review Authors' conclusions Pneumothorax is a potentially life‐threatening complication for people with cystic fibrosis and the management of spontaneous pneumothoraces remains a topic of considerable controversy. Medical and surgical intervention are the two main categories for the treatment of recurrent pneumothoraces in this population. However, it is disappointing that neither intervention has been assessed by randomised controlled trials. This systematic review identifies the need for a multicentre randomised controlled trial assessing both efficacy and possible adverse effects of the use of chemical pleurodesis versus surgical interventions for the treatment of persistent and recurrent pneumothoraces in people with cystic fibrosis. Due to a current lack of research in this area, while searches will still be undertaken every two years, the review will only be updated if any new evidence comes to light. Plain language summary Chemicals for sticking the outer lung surface to surrounding membranes compared to surgery to stop air persistently collecting in the chest Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease which irreversibly damages the lungs. People with cystic fibrosis are prone to getting a pneumothorax. A pneumothorax is defined as the presence of air in the space between the two linings of the lungs. It can potentially kill people with cystic fibrosis because of the added stress on the heart and lungs. It can be treated by surgical and non‐surgical interventions. However, although these treatments are generally effective, they are far from perfect. Certain treatments work in some people but not others. Also, the treatments do have side effects and can be dangerous for people with cystic fibrosis. Currently, physicians do not know the safest and most effective way of treating pneumothorax in people with cystic fibrosis. We did not find any randomised controlled trials that compared the surgical and non‐surgical treatments for pneumothorax in people with cystic fibrosis. Therefore, more research is needed in this field. Future studies should compare the safety and efficacy of surgical and non‐surgical interventions for pneumothorax in people with cystic fibrosis. There is currently no research being undertaken in this area. We will continue to search for evidence, but will not be updating the review until we find new evidence.","12","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Humans; Pleurodesis [*methods]; Pneumothorax [etiology, surgery, *therapy]; Recurrence","10.1002/14651858.CD007481.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007481.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Increasingly, some people with SCD develop secondary iron overload due to occasional red blood cell transfusions or are on long‐term transfusion programmes for e.g. secondary stroke prevention. Iron chelation therapy can prevent long‐term complications. Deferoxamine and deferiprone have been found to be efficacious. However, questions exist about the effectiveness and safety of the newer oral chelator deferasirox. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of oral deferasirox in people with SCD and secondary iron overload. Search methods We searched the Cystic Fibrosis & Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: date of most recent search:13 March 2014. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Biosis Previews, Web of Science, Derwent Drug File, XTOXLINE, EBMR and  The Cochrane Library , respectively; date of most recent searches: 02 August 2013. We searched four trial registries:  www.controlled‐trials.com ;  www.clinicaltrials.gov ;  www.who.int./ictrp/en/ ;  www.drks.de ; date of most recent searches: 03 June 2013. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing deferasirox with no therapy or placebo or with another iron chelating treatment schedule. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted the corresponding study authors for additional information. Main results Two studies (with 203 and 212 people) comparing the efficacy and safety of deferasirox and deferoxamine after 12 months and 24 weeks, respectively, were included. The overall quality, according to GRADE, for the main outcomes was moderate to low. Only limited data were available on mortality and end‐organ damage, although one study did assess mortality, relative risk 1.26 (95% confidence interval 0.05 to 30.41), the 24‐week follow up was too short to allow us to draw firm conclusions. One study reported a relative risk of 1.26 for the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (95% confidence interval 0.05 to 30.41). Serum ferritin reduction was significantly greater with deferoxamine, mean difference of change of 440.69 µg/l (95% confidence interval 11.73 to 869.64). Liver iron concentration (reported in one study) measured by superconduction quantum interference device showed no significant difference for the overall group of patients adjusted for transfusion category, mean difference ‐0.20 mg Fe/g dry weight (95% confidence interval ‐3.15 to 2.75). The occurrence of serious adverse events did not differ between drugs. Nausea, diarrhoea and rash occurred significantly more often in people treated with deferasirox, while adverse events of any kind were more often reported for patients treated with deferoxamine (one study). The mean increase of creatinine was also significantly higher with deferasirox, mean difference 3.24 (95% confidence interval 0.45 to 6.03). Long‐term adverse events could not be measured in the included studies (follow up 52 weeks and 24 weeks). Patient satisfaction and the likelihood of continuing treatment, were significantly better with deferasirox. Authors' conclusions Deferasirox appears to be of similar efficacy to deferoxamine depending on depending on the appropriate ratio of doses of deferoxamine and deferasirox being compared. However, only limited evidence is available assessing the efficacy regarding patient‐important outcomes. The short‐term safety of deferasirox seems to be acceptable, however, follow up in the available studies was too short to assess long‐term side effects. Long‐term safety and efficacy data are available from a non‐controlled extension phase not included in our review; however, no valid comparative conclusions can be drawn and future studies should assess comparatively long‐term outcomes both for safety and efficacy. Plain language summary Deferasirox for managing transfusional iron overload in people with sickle cell disease Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of deferasirox on secondary iron load in people with sickle cell disease. Background Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder. An increasing number of people with this disorder show secondary iron overload (an accumulation of excess iron in the body) due to repeated red blood cell transfusions. Since the human body is not able to actively get rid of excessive iron, drug treatment (known as iron chelators) is needed. Several years ago, a new oral iron chelator, deferasirox, was introduced. However, it is not known whether deferasirox offers advantages compared to other iron chelators (deferoxamine or deferiprone) with regard to effectiveness and safety. Study characteristics Two randomised studies, with moderate overall quality of evidence, comparing deferasirox to deferoxamine were identified. The evidence is current to 02 August 2013. The studies with 203 and 212 participants lasted for 12 months and 24 weeks, respectively. Key results Only little data on patient‐important outcomes such as mortality (limited by a short study follow up) and end‐organ damage (incidence of diabetes mellitus) were available. Iron removal, as measured by the surrogate marker serum ferritin was significantly greater with deferoxamine. In one study, both drugs were reported to work equally well in reducing liver iron concentration. The safety of deferasirox was acceptable; the main side effects when compared to deferoxamine were increased frequency of nausea, diarrhoea and rash as well as a mean increase of creatinine, while adverse events of any kind were observed more often in people treated with deferoxamine. Patient satisfaction and compliance with therapy was significantly greater with deferasirox. Quality of the evidence The overall quality of evidence rated according to the GRADE criteria was moderate due to issues with study design. For four outcomes, namely liver iron concentration, serum ferritin, creatinine increase and satisfaction with treatment, it was judged as 'moderate' quality; for one outcome (discontinuations) was judged as 'low' quality. Summary In summary, the evidence from the two included studies suggests that deferasirox is similarly effective as deferoxamine depending on the appropriate ratio of doses of deferoxamine and deferasirox being compared. In the short term, deferasirox appears to have an acceptable safety profile, but there are no comparative data based on randomised controlled trials available looking at long‐term safety. Further data on long‐term efficacy on patient‐relevant outcomes and long‐term adverse effects are needed to decide whether deferasirox should be used as alternative to the first‐line option of deferoxamine. Currently, its use seems to be mainly warranted as a treatment option for people with sickle cell disease who cannot tolerate or comply with deferoxamine.","5","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Anemia, Sickle Cell [blood, *therapy]; Benzoates [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Chelation Therapy [adverse effects, *methods]; Deferasirox; Deferoxamine [adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Erythrocyte Transfusion [adverse effects]; Ferritins [blood]; Humans; Iron Chelating Agents [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Iron Overload [*drug therapy, etiology]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Triazoles [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]","10.1002/14651858.CD007477.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007477.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

In particular, people with thalassaemia major develop secondary iron overload resulting from regular red blood cell transfusions. Iron chelation therapy is needed to prevent long‐term complications. Both deferoxamine and deferiprone are effective; however, a review of the effectiveness and safety of the newer oral chelator deferasirox in people with thalassaemia is needed. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of oral deferasirox in people with thalassaemia and iron overload. Search methods We searched the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 12 August 2016. We also searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Biosis Previews, Web of Science Core Collection and three trial registries: ClinicalTrials.gov; the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; and the Internet Portal of the German Clinical Trials Register: 06 and 07 August 2015. Selection criteria Randomised controlled studies comparing deferasirox with no therapy or placebo or with another iron‐chelating treatment. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. Main results Sixteen studies involving 1807 randomised participants (range 23 to 586 participants) were included. Twelve two‐arm studies compared deferasirox to placebo (two studies) or deferoxamine (seven studies) or deferiprone (one study) or the combination of deferasirox and deferoxamine to deferoxamine alone (one study). One study compared the combination of deferasirox and deferiprone to deferiprone in combination with deferoxamine. Three three‐arm studies compared deferasirox to deferoxamine and deferiprone (two studies) or the combination of deferasirox and deferiprone to deferiprone and deferasirox monotherapy respectively (one study). One four‐arm study compared two different doses of deferasirox to matching placebo groups. The two studies (a pharmacokinetic and a dose‐escalation study) comparing deferasirox to placebo (n = 47) in people with transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia showed that deferasirox leads to net iron excretion. In these studies, safety was acceptable and further investigation in phase II and phase III studies was warranted. Nine studies (1251 participants) provided data for deferasirox versus standard treatment with deferoxamine. Data suggest that a similar efficacy can be achieved depending on the ratio of doses of deferoxamine and deferasirox being compared. In the phase III study, similar or superior efficacy for the intermediate markers ferritin and liver iron concentration (LIC) could only be achieved in the highly iron‐overloaded subgroup at a mean ratio of 1 mg of deferasirox to 1.8 mg of deferoxamine corresponding to a mean dose of 28.2 mg per day and 51.6 mg per day respectively. The pooled effects across the different dosing ratios are: serum ferritin, mean difference (MD) 454.42 ng/mL (95% confidence interval (CI) 337.13 to 571.71) (moderate quality evidence); LIC evaluated by biopsy or SQUID, MD 2.37 mg Fe/g dry weight (95% CI 1.68 to 3.07) (moderate quality evidence) and responder analysis, LIC 1 to < 7 mg Fe/g dry weight, risk ratio (RR) 0.80 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.92) (moderate quality evidence). The substantial heterogeneity observed could be explained by the different dosing ratios. Data on mortality (low quality evidence) and on safety at the presumably required doses for effective chelation therapy are limited. Patient satisfaction was better with deferasirox among those who had previously received deferoxamine treatment, RR 2.20 (95% CI 1.89 to 2.57) (moderate quality evidence). The rate of discontinuations was similar for both drugs (low quality evidence). For the remaining comparisons in people with transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia, the quality of the evidence for outcomes assessed was low to very low, mainly due to the very small number of participants included. Four studies (205 participants) compared deferasirox to deferiprone; one of which (41 participants) revealed a higher number of participants experiencing arthralgia in the deferiprone group, but due to the large number of different types of adverse events reported and compared this result is uncertain. One study (96 participants) compared deferasirox combined with deferiprone to deferiprone with deferoxamine. Participants treated with the combination of the oral iron chelators had a higher adherence compared to those treated with deferiprone and deferoxamine, but no participants discontinued the study. In the comparisons of deferasirox versus combined deferasirox and deferiprone and that of deferiprone versus combined deferasirox and deferiprone (one study, 40 participants), and deferasirox and deferoxamine versus deferoxamine alone (one study, 94 participants), only a few patient‐relevant outcomes were reported and no significant differences were observed. One study (166 participants) included people with non‐transfusion dependent thalassaemia and compared two different doses of deferasirox to placebo. Deferasirox treatment reduced serum ferritin, MD ‐306.74 ng/mL (95% CI ‐398.23 to ‐215.24) (moderate quality evidence) and LIC, MD ‐3.27 mg Fe/g dry weight (95% CI ‐4.44 to ‐2.09) (moderate quality evidence), while the number of participants experiencing adverse events and rate of discontinuations (low quality evidence) was similar in both groups. No participant died, but data on mortality were limited due to a follow‐up period of only one year (moderate quality evidence). Authors' conclusions Deferasirox offers an important treatment option for people with thalassaemia and secondary iron overload. Based on the available data, deferasirox does not seem to be superior to deferoxamine at the usually recommended ratio of 1 mg of deferasirox to 2 mg of deferoxamine. However, similar efficacy seems to be achievable depending on the dose and ratio of deferasirox compared to deferoxamine. Whether this will result in similar efficacy and will translate to similar benefits in the long term, as has been shown for deferoxamine, needs to be confirmed. Data from randomised controlled trials on rare toxicities and long‐term safety are still limited. However, after a detailed discussion of the potential benefits and risks, deferasirox could be offered as the first‐line option to individuals who show a strong preference for deferasirox, and may be a reasonable treatment option for people showing an intolerance or poor adherence to deferoxamine. Plain language summary Deferasirox for managing iron overload in people with thalassaemia Background Thalassaemia is a hereditary anaemia due to a defect in the production of haemoglobin. Regular red blood cell transfusions are needed, particularly for the severe form of the disease, thalassaemia major. This results in iron overload. Since the human body has no means of actively getting rid of excessive iron, drug treatment (iron‐chelating drugs) is needed. Several years ago, a newer oral iron chelator, deferasirox, was introduced. Review question Does deferasirox offer advantages compared to placebo or to the other iron chelators deferoxamine or deferiprone in people with thalassaemia with regard to effectiveness and safety? Study characteristics The evidence is current to 12 August 2016. This updated review includes 16 randomised controlled studies (1807 participants) containing 20 comparisons of deferasirox versus another treatment. In people with transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia, two studies compared deferasirox with placebo and nine studies (1251 participants) compared deferasirox with standard treatment of deferoxamine. Four studies (205 participants) compared deferasirox to deferiprone. One study each compared deferasirox and deferiprone respectively to deferasirox and deferiprone combination therapy (40 participants), deferasirox and deferoxamine combination therapy to deferoxamine alone (94 participants) and deferasirox and deferiprone combination therapy to deferiprone and deferoxamine combination therapy (96 participants). In people with non‐transfusion dependent thalassemia (individuals not requiring regular blood transfusions), one study (166 participants) compared deferasirox to placebo. The duration of the included studies ranged from 12 days to two years. Key results Two studies comparing deferasirox with placebo in people with transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia showed that deferasirox was effective at removing iron. Nine other studies compared deferasirox with standard treatment of deferoxamine. Similar effectiveness seems possible, depending of the doses of the two drugs compared. It needs to be confirmed whether this leads to similar improvements in patient‐important outcomes in the long run. The safety of deferasirox was acceptable; however, rarer adverse events or long‐term side effects could not be adequately investigated due to the limited number of participants and the relatively short duration of the studies. Patient satisfaction was significantly better with deferasirox among those who had previously been treated with deferoxamine. The rate of discontinuations was similar for both drugs. Deferasirox may be an alternative for those individuals who do not tolerate, or have poor adherence with, deferoxamine. In people with a strong preference to deferasirox, potential benefits and risks should be discussed. One study (41 participants) reported that more individuals with transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia experienced joint pain when treated with deferiprone than with deferasirox, but due to the large number of different types of adverse events reported and compared, this result may be due to chance. One study revealed that adherence to treatment was higher when both oral iron chelators, deferasirox and deferiprone are used than the combination of deferiprone and deferoxamine, but no participant discontinued the study. We found no evidence for any differences comparing deferasirox or deferiprone alone to combined deferasirox and deferiprone treatment or deferasirox and deferoxamine combination to deferoxamine alone, but the numbers of people in the studies were small and available data were very limited. One study in people with non‐transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia found deferasirox was better at reducing serum ferritin and liver iron concentration compared to placebo. However, there is no evidence on the impact on patient‐important outcomes or long‐term safety data in this population. Quality of the evidence The quality of included studies comparing deferasirox to deferoxamine in people with transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia was moderate to low, mainly due fact that the investigators and participants knew which interventions had been assigned to which participants, the small number of participants included in the studies and the use of a surrogate markers (measures used in place of a hard clinical end point) instead of patient‐important outcomes. For the comparison of deferasirox to placebo in people with non‐transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia, the quality of the evidence was moderate to very low based on only one small study. For the other comparisons, the quality of the evidence was low to very low, mainly due to the inclusion of even fewer participants. Ideally, further randomised studies looking at patient‐important, long‐term outcomes and rarer adverse events, should be conducted.","8","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Administration, Oral; Benzoates [administration & dosage, adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic; Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic; Deferasirox; Deferiprone; Deferoxamine [administration & dosage, therapeutic use]; Erythrocyte Transfusion [adverse effects]; Ferritins [blood]; Humans; Iron Chelating Agents [administration & dosage, adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Iron Overload [blood, *drug therapy, etiology]; Patient Satisfaction; Pyridones [administration & dosage, therapeutic use]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Thalassemia [*complications, mortality, therapy]; Triazoles [administration & dosage, adverse effects, *therapeutic use]","10.1002/14651858.CD007476.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007476.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Severity is variable from less severe anaemia, through thalassaemia intermedia, to profound severe anaemia (thalassaemia major). In thalassaemia major other complications include growth retardation, bone deformation, and enlarged spleen. Blood transfusion is required to treat severe forms of thalassaemia, but this results in excessive accumulation of iron in the body (iron overload), removed mostly by a drug called desferrioxamine through 'chelation therapy'. Non‐routine treatments are bone marrow transplantation (which is age restricted), and possibly hydroxyurea, designed to raise foetal haemoglobin level, thus reducing anaemia. In addition, psychological therapies seem appropriate to improving outcome and adherence to medical treatment. Objectives To examine the evidence that in people with thalassaemia, psychological treatments improve the ability to cope with the condition, and improve both medical and psychosocial outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Searches on the Internet were also performed. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 11 November 2013. Selection criteria All randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing the use of psychological intervention to no (psychological) intervention in people with thalassaemia. Data collection and analysis No trials of psychological therapies have been found in the literature for inclusion in this review. Main results There are currently no results to be reported. Authors' conclusions As a chronic disease with a considerable role for self‐management, psychological support seems appropriate for managing thalassaemia. However, from the information currently available, no conclusions can be made about the use of specific psychological therapies in thalassaemia. This systematic review has clearly identified the need for well‐designed, adequately‐powered, multicentre, randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of specific psychological interventions for thalassaemia. Plain language summary Using psychological treatments to help people manage thalassaemia Thalassaemia is a group of genetic blood disorders. Blood transfusion is needed to treat severe forms of the condition, but this results in a high level of iron in the body. This excess iron is usually removed by drugs through 'chelation therapy'. Other less usual treatments are bone marrow transplantation, which is restricted by age, and hydroxyurea, a drug designed to raise the level of foetal haemoglobin and reduce anaemia. Psychological support would seem suitable to manage thalassaemia which is a chronic disease with a considerable role for self‐management. We were not able to find any trials to include in this review. There are some reports that teaching people about their condition improves adherence to chelation therapy. However, from the information currently available, we can not recommend the use of specific psychological therapies in thalassaemia.

However, there is a risk of gastroesophageal reflux associated with this technique. This is an update of a review published in 2015. Objectives To compare the effects of standard postural drainage (15º to 45º head‐down tilt) with modified postural drainage (15º to 30º head‐up tilt) with regard to gastroesophageal reflux in infants and young children up to six years old with cystic fibrosis in terms of safety and efficacy. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Additional searches were conducted on ClinicalTrials.gov and on the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for any planned, ongoing and unpublished studies. The date of the most recent literature searches: 19 June 2017. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled studies that compared two postural drainage regimens (standard and modified postural drainage) with regard to gastroesophageal reflux in infants and young children (up to and including six years old) with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently identified studies for inclusion, extracted outcome data and assessed risk of bias. We resolved disagreements by consensus or by involving a third review author. We contacted study authors to obtain missing or additional information. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Main results Two studies, involving a total of 40 participants, were eligible for inclusion in the review. We included no new studies in the 2018 update. The included studies were different in terms of the age of participants, the angle of tilt, the reported outcomes, the number of sessions and the study duration. The following outcomes were measured: appearance or exacerbation of gastroesophageal reflux episodes; percentage of peripheral oxygen saturation; number of exacerbations of upper respiratory tract symptoms; number of days on antibiotics for acute exacerbations; chest X‐ray scores; and pulmonary function tests. One study reported that postural drainage with a 20 °  head‐down position did not appear to exacerbate gastroesophageal reflux. However, the majority of the reflux episodes in this study reached the upper oesophagus (moderate‐quality evidence). The second included study reported that modified postural drainage (30 °  head‐up tilt) was associated with fewer number of gastroesophageal reflux episodes and fewer respiratory complications than standard postural drainage (30 °  head‐down tilt) (moderate‐quality evidence). The included studies had an overall low risk of bias. One included study was funded by the Sydney Children’s Hospital Foundation and the other by the Royal Children’s Hospital Research Foundation and Physiotherapy Research Foundation of Australia. Data were not able to be pooled by meta‐analysis due to differences in the statistical presentation of the data. Authors' conclusions The limited evidence regarding the comparison between the two regimens of postural drainage is still weak due to the small number of included studies, the small number of participants assessed, the inability to perform any meta‐analyses and some methodological issues with the studies. However, it may be inferred that the use of a postural regimen with a 30 °  head‐up tilt is associated with a lower number of gastroesophageal reflux episodes and fewer respiratory complications in the long term. The 20 °  head‐down postural drainage position was not found to be significantly different from the 20 °  head‐up tilt modified position. Nevertheless, the fact that the majority of reflux episodes reached the upper oesophagus should make physiotherapists carefully consider their treatment strategy. We do not envisage that there will be any new trials undertaken that will affect the conclusions of this review; therefore, we do not plan to update this review. Plain language summary Postural drainage in infants and young children with cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence about how different postural drainage positions affect gastroesophageal reflux in infants and young children up to six years old with cystic fibrosis. We compared standard postural drainage (includes head‐down tilt) with modified postural drainage (includes horizontal positions and head‐up tilt). This is an update of a previously published review. Background Although cystic fibrosis is a disorder that affects many organs, pulmonary disease is the most common cause of illness and death. Chest physiotherapy is recommended to clear the airways and improve lung function. Postural drainage is a type of chest physiotherapy used to treat children with cystic fibrosis. However, there is a risk of gastroesophageal reflux (the return of stomach contents back up into the oesophagus (throat area)) associated with this technique. Search date The evidence is current to: 19 June 2017. Study characteristics The review included two studies concerning 40 children with cystic fibrosis up to six years of age .  One included study used a 20 °  head‐down tilt and head‐up tilt of 20 degrees and the other used modified postural drainage (30 °  head‐up tilt) compared to standard postural drainage (using a 30 °  head‐down tilt). Children were randomly selected for one treatment or the other. One study was carried out over a 24‐hour period and the second over two days, but with a five‐year follow‐up period. The age range of the participants varied from three weeks to 34 months. One included study was funded by the Sydney Children’s Hospital Foundation and the other by the Royal Children’s Hospital Research Foundation and Physiotherapy Research Foundation of Australia. Key results One included study using a 20 °  head‐down tilt and 20 °  head‐up tilt did not find differences regarding the number of gastroesophageal reflux episodes between the two postural drainage regimens whereas the other study found that modified postural drainage (30 °  head‐up tilt) was associated with fewer number of reflux episodes and fewer respiratory complications than standard postural drainage (using a 30 °  head‐down tilt) in infants with cystic fibrosis. The age of participants, angle of tilt, reported outcomes, number of sessions and study duration differed between the two studies. However, the use of a 30 °  head‐up tilt seems to result in fewer reflux episodes and respiratory complications than a 30° head‐down tilt position. Even though one study did not find differences between two techniques, in most of the reflux episodes stomach contents reached the upper oesophagus with a potential for choking. This should make physiotherapists carefully consider their choice of technique. We do not envisage that there will be any new trials undertaken that will affect the conclusions of this review; therefore, we do not plan to update this review. Quality of the evidence Both studies were of moderate (so we think further research could have an important impact on the results) quality and appeared to be well run and we do not think any factors will influence the results in a negative way.","3","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Anti-Bacterial Agents [therapeutic use]; Child, Preschool; Cystic Fibrosis [*complications]; Disease Progression; Drainage, Postural [*methods]; Gastroesophageal Reflux [*etiology]; Head-Down Tilt [adverse effects, *physiology]; Humans; Infant; Lung [*metabolism]; Mucus [metabolism]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Time Factors","10.1002/14651858.CD010297.pub3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010297.pub3","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

Splenectomy and blood transfusion, with their consequences, are the mainstay of long‐term management used in different parts of the world. This is a 2017 update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002, and previously updated, most recently in 2015. Objectives To assess whether splenectomy (total or partial), to prevent acute splenic sequestration crises in people with sickle cell disease, improved survival and decreased morbidity in people with sickle cell disease, as compared with regular blood transfusions. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched clinical trial registries. Additional trials were sought from the reference lists of the trials and reviews identified by the search strategy. Date of the most recent search: 14 August 2017. Selection criteria All randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled trials comparing splenectomy (total or partial) to prevent recurrence of acute splenic sequestration crises with no treatment or blood transfusions in people with sickle cell disease. Data collection and analysis No trials of splenectomy for acute splenic sequestration were found. Main results No trials of splenectomy for acute splenic sequestration were found. Authors' conclusions Splenectomy, if full, will prevent further sequestration and if partial, may reduce the recurrence of acute splenic sequestration crises. However, there is a lack of evidence from trials showing that splenectomy improves survival and decreases morbidity in people with sickle cell disease. There is a need for a well‐designed, adequately‐powered, randomized controlled trial to assess the benefits and risks of splenectomy compared to transfusion programmes, as a means of improving survival and decreasing mortality from acute splenic sequestration in people with sickle cell disease. There are no trials included in the review and we have not identified any relevant trials up to August 2017. We will continue to run searches to identify any potentially relevant trials; however, we do not plan to update other sections of the review until new trials are published. Plain language summary Removing spleens from people with sickle cell disease after a splenic sequestration compared to blood transfusions to prevent further attacks Review question We reviewed the evidence to see whether removing all, of part of, the spleen to prevent acute splenic sequestration improved survival and decreased illness in people with sickle cell disease, as compared with regular blood transfusion. This is a 2017 update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002, and previously updated, most recently in 2015. Background In some people with sickle cell disease, red blood cells become trapped and destroyed in the spleen. This damages the spleen, which may become enlarged leading to splenic sequestration crises. These crises consist of abdominal pain, rapid heart rate and other symptoms. Such an attack can be fatal without prompt treatment. All or part of the spleen (splenectomy) is often removed after a person has survived such a crisis to try and prevent another one. This surgery may leave the individual at a higher risk of infection. We looked for trials which compared surgery to blood transfusions. Search date The evidence is current to: 14 August 2017. Key results We found no trials to provide reliable evidence about the risks or benefits of splenectomy for people with sickle cell disease after splenic sequestration. There is a need for a trial to assess the benefits and risks of splenectomy compared to transfusion programmes. There are no trials included in the review and we have not identified any relevant trials up to August 2017. We will continue to run searches to identify any potentially relevant trials; however, we do not plan to update other sections of the review until new trials are published.","11","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Blood Transfusion; *Conservative Treatment; *Splenectomy; Acute Disease; Anemia, Sickle Cell [*complications]; Humans; Recurrence; Secondary Prevention; Splenic Diseases [surgery, *therapy]","10.1002/14651858.CD003425.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003425.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"

However, there are no clinical trials that have assessed the safety and efficacy of this treatment in comparison to other conservative measures (enzyme replacement therapy, substrate reduction therapy) now in use. There are no trials included in the review and we have not identified any relevant trials up to March 2017. We therefore do not plan to update this review until new trials are published. Plain language summary Stem cell transplantation for treating Gaucher disease Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in people with Gaucher disease. Background Gaucher disease is an inherited disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. This leads to storage of complex lipids in some types of blood cells. Due to these abnormal cells people with Gaucher disease will have pain, fatigue, anemia, jaundice and bone damage. Some forms of Gaucher disease may also cause neurological damage. The treatment of Gaucher disease at present is mainly by enzyme replacement therapy which is expensive. In some severe cases HSCT is used to treat people with Gaucher disease. This is a high risk procedure sometimes leading to death of the individual. Search date The evidence is current to: 19 January 2017. Study characteristics We have not found any trials to show the effectiveness and the risks of the procedure in people with Gaucher disease. Key results We have not found any trials assessing the effectiveness and the risks of the procedure in people with Gaucher disease. There are no trials included in the review and we have not identified any relevant trials up to January 2017. We therefore do not plan to update this review until new trials are published. Quality of the evidence We have not found any trials assessing the effectiveness and the risks of the procedure in people with Gaucher disease.","10","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation [mortality]; Gaucher Disease [*surgery]; Humans","10.1002/14651858.CD006974.pub4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006974.pub4","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD008017.PUB5","Hsu, CCT; Kwan, GNC; Evans‐Barns, H; van Driel, ML","Embolisation for pulmonary arteriovenous malformation","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2018","Abstract - Background Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations are abnormal direct connections between the pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein which result in a right‐to‐left shunt. They are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality mainly from the effects of paradoxical emboli. Potential complications include stroke, cerebral abscess, pulmonary haemorrhage and hypoxaemia. Embolisation is an endovascular intervention based on the occlusion of the feeding arteries the pulmonary arteriovenous malformations thus eliminating the abnormal right‐to‐left‐shunting. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To determine the efficacy and safety of embolisation in patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations including a comparison with surgical resection and different embolisation devices. Search methods We searched the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register; date of last search: 10 April 2017. We also searched the following databases: the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry; ClinicalTrials.gov; International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register; International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal (last searched 27 August 2017). to be updated We checked cross‐references and searched references from review articles. Selection criteria Trials in which individuals with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations were randomly allocated to embolisation compared to no treatment, surgical resection or embolisation using a different embolisation device . Data collection and analysis Studies identified for potential inclusion were independently assessed for eligibility by two authors, with excluded studies further checked by a third author. No trials were identified for inclusion in the review and hence no analysis was performed. Main results There were no randomised controlled trials included in the review; one ongoing trial has been identified which may be eligible for inclusion in the future. Authors' conclusions There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials for embolisation of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. However, randomised controlled trials are not always feasible on ethical grounds. Accumulated data from observational studies suggest that embolisation is a safe procedure which reduces morbidity and mortality. A standardised approach to reporting with long‐term follow‐up through registry studies can help to strengthen the evidence for embolisation in the absence of randomised controlled trials. Plain language summary Embolisation therapy for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of blocking the blood vessels which feed abnormal direct connections between arteries and veins in people who have these in their lungs. Background Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations are abnormal connections between arteries and veins in the lung which can cause serious complications such as stroke, brain abscess, bleeding in the lung and poor oxygenation. Embolisation is the mainstream treatment for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. During the procedure, balloon or coil embolisation devices (or both combined) are used to block the feeding artery or arteries to the malformation. These malformations can often be small, multiple and widely spread out, so not all of them are suitable for embolisation treatment. This is an update of a previously published review. Search date The evidence is current to: 10 April 2017. Study characteristics In this systematic review, we did not include any randomised controlled trials of embolisation versus surgery or comparing different embolisation devices. We have identified one ongoing trial comparing two different embolisation devices which might be eligible for inclusion in the review when it is completed. Key results While no randomised controlled trials of this treatment are included in this review, a number of observational studies have suggested embolisation therapy has benefits. However, randomised controlled trials are not always feasible on ethical grounds. In the absence of randomised controlled trials, a standardised approach to reporting, as well as long‐term follow‐up through registry studies can help to improve the safety and outcome of embolisation for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. Quality of the evidence We have not been able to present any evidence from randomised controlled trials in this version of the review.","1","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Arteriovenous Malformations [*therapy]; Embolization, Therapeutic [adverse effects, *methods]; Humans; Pulmonary Artery [*abnormalities]; Pulmonary Veins [*abnormalities]","10.1002/14651858.CD008017.pub5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008017.pub5","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
"CD012102.PUB2","Smith, S; Edwards, CT","Long‐acting inhaled bronchodilators for cystic fibrosis","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","2017","Abstract - Background Cystic fibrosis is a life‐limiting inherited condition which affects one in 2500 newborns in the UK and 70,000 children and adults worldwide. The condition is multifaceted and affects many systems in the body. The respiratory system is particularly affected due to a build up of thickened secretions and a predisposition to infection. Inhaled bronchodilators are prescribed for 80% of people with cystic fibrosis in order to widen the airways and alleviate symptoms. Both short‐ and long‐acting inhaled bronchodilators are used to improve respiratory symptoms. Short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators take effect in minutes and typically last for four to eight hours (muscarinic antagonists). Long‐acting inhaled bronchodilators also take effect within minutes but typically last for around 12 hours and sometimes longer. This review is one of two which are replacing a previously published review of both long‐ and short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators. However, due to the lack of research in this area, we do not envisage undertaking any further updates of this long‐acting inhaled bronchodilators review. Objectives This review aims to evaluate long‐acting inhaled bronchodilators in children and adults with cystic fibrosis in terms of clinical outcomes and safety. If possible, we aimed to assess the optimal drug and dosage regimen. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of last search: 10 October 2017. We also carried out a separate search of Embase and the reference lists of included trials. We searched clinical trials registries for any ongoing trials and made contact with pharmaceutical companies for any further trials. Date of Embase search: 11 October 2017. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi‐randomised parallel trials comparing long‐acting inhaled bronchodilators (beta‐2 agonists and muscarinic antagonists) with placebo, no treatment or a different long‐acting inhaled bronchodilator in adults and children with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Both authors independently assessed trials for inclusion (based on title, abstract and full text). The authors independently assessed the included trials for quality and risk of bias and extracted data. Discrepancies were resolved by a third party. Main results The searches identified 195 unique references, of which 155 were excluded on title and abstract. We assessed the full texts of the remaining references, excluded 16 trials (28 references) and included four trials (12 references) in the review with 1082 participants. One trial (n = 16) measuring the effect of beta‐2 agonists reported an improvement in forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV 1 ) after treatment (at one month), but the trial was small with an unclear risk of bias so we judged the evidence to be very low quality. The trial did not report on participant‐reported outcomes, quality of life or adverse events. Three trials (n = 1066) looked at the effects of the muscarinic antagonist tiotropium at doses of 2.5 µg and 5.0 µg in both the short term (up to 28 days) and the longer term (up to three months). Only one of the trials reported the change in FEV 1  (L) after 28 days treatment and showed no significant difference between groups; with 2.5 µg tiotropium, mean difference (MD) ‐0.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.13 to 0.09), or 5.0 µg tiotropium, MD 0.00 (95% CI ‐0.10 to 0.10) (moderate‐quality evidence). All three trials of muscarinic antagonists provided data on adverse events which were found to differ little from placebo at doses of 2.5 µg, risk ratio (RR) 1.01 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.11) or 5.0 µg, RR 0.98 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.06). Very little participant‐reported outcome data or quality of life data were available for analysis. Two of the trials were at low risk of bias overall whilst the remaining trial was at an unclear risk overall. Authors' conclusions Neither long‐acting beta‐2 agonists nor long‐acting muscarinic antagonist bronchodilators demonstrate improvement in our primary outcome of FEV 1 . No difference was observed between intervention and placebo in terms of quality of life or adverse events. The quality of evidence for the use of beta‐2 agonists was very low. The use of a long‐acting inhaled bronchodilator may help to reduce the burden of treatment for people with cystic fibrosis as it is taken less often than a short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator, but future trials would benefit from looking at the effects on our primary outcomes (spirometric changes from baseline, quality of life and adverse effects) in the longer term. Plain language summary Long‐acting inhaled treatment to open up the airways in cystic fibrosis Review question We reviewed the evidence for the benefit of long‐acting inhaled bronchodilators (treatment which opens up the airways often called ""relievers"") in people with cystic fibrosis. Background Cystic fibrosis affects many systems in the body, in particular how well the lungs work. There is a build‐up of thickened, sticky mucus which makes breathing more difficult and makes people with cystic fibrosis more likely to get infections in their lungs. Short‐ and long‐acting bronchodilators are prescribed for most people with cystic fibrosis to widen the airways and improve symptoms. This review partly replaces an earlier review of both short‐acting and long‐acting inhaled bronchodilators. However, due to the lack of research in this area, we do not plan to update this review of long‐acting inhaled bronchodilators again. Search date The evidence is current to: 10 October 2017. Trial characteristics We included four trials in our review, with a total of 1082 people whose ages ranged from five months to 70 years. The trials included in the review looked at the effects of two different types of long‐acting inhaled bronchodilator (beta‐2 agonists e.g. salmeterol, and muscarinic antagonists e.g. tiotropium). The trials lasted between 28 days and 12 weeks. Key results The small trial of beta‐2 agonists compared to placebo (no active medication) reported some improvement in lung function (forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV 1 )) after treatment, but did not provide data we could analyse. They did not report on any side effects. Only one of the three trials comparing tiotropium to a placebo reported on FEV 1  (measured in litres) and found little difference between treatment and placebo. Two of these trials reported on quality of life, but there was not enough evidence to comment on whether this improved or not. Three trials noted side effects, some of which were seen after treatment with tiotropium, but these symptoms were also seen in the group of people who were given placebo. Future trials would improve our knowledge if they measure side effects and quality of life in a more meaningful way. Quality of the evidence Only 16 people took part in the trial of the beta‐2 agonist which only lasted for 28 days, which makes the results less reliable. The trials of muscarinic antagonists included 1066 people and the trials appeared to be well run. We don't think any design factors will have influenced the results in a negative way. None of the trials ran for more than 12 weeks which makes it difficult to comment on the effects over a longer time period.","12","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","1465-1858","Administration, Inhalation; Adrenergic beta-2 Receptor Agonists [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]; Bronchodilator Agents [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]; Cystic Fibrosis [*drug therapy]; Disease Progression; Forced Expiratory Volume [drug effects]; Humans; Muscarinic Antagonists [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Time Factors; Tiotropium Bromide [administration & dosage, *therapeutic use]","10.1002/14651858.CD012102.pub2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012102.pub2","Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders"
